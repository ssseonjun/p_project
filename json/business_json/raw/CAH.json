Our CISO has over twenty-five years of experience in information technology (“IT”), with twenty years in IT risk management, compliance, and information security, as well as a background in leading technical infrastructure teams and roles supporting business operations.\nAs part of management’s oversight of our cybersecurity program, we maintain an IT risk governance process that includes multiple levels of escalation from our IT Risk Advisory Board, which meets on a monthly basis and whose membership includes the CISO and IT functional area leadership, to an executive-level committee to help address cybersecurity risks at an enterprise level.\nThe company’s Board oversees our overall risk management process. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee primary responsibility for overseeing cybersecurity and other major technology-related risks and our actions to monitor and mitigate such risks. In coordination with the Audit Committee, the Risk Oversight Committee of the Board monitors Cardinal Health’s compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including with respect to data privacy and security. Our Audit Committee receives at least quarterly updates from the CISO and CIO and the Board receives at least annual cybersecurity updates. Among other items, these updates cover a range of matters relevant to our cybersecurity program, including: the threat environment and related business risks; the state, priorities of, and investments in our cybersecurity program; the availability of cyber insurance; review of certain cybersecurity incidents that have occurred within the company and the industry; and relevant cybersecurity operational metrics.\nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n41\nProperties and Legal Proceedings\nProperties\nIn the United States, at June 30, 2025, the Pharma segment operated one national logistics center and a number of primary pharmaceutical and specialty distribution facilities. The GMPD segment operated medical-surgical distribution, assembly, manufacturing, and other operating facilities in the United States. \nAt June 30, 2025, our GMPD segment also operated manufacturing facilities in Canada, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Thailand.\nOur Other Operating Segments operated facilities throughout the United States.\nOur principal executive offices are headquartered in an owned building located at 7000 Cardinal Place in Dublin, Ohio.\nWe consider our operating properties to be in satisfactory condition and adequate to meet our present needs. However, we regularly evaluate operating properties and may make further additions and improvements or consolidate locations as we seek opportunities to expand or enhance the efficiency of our business.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe legal proceedings described in \nNote 8\n of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" are incorporated in this \"Legal Proceedings\" section by reference.\n \n42\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nMarket for Registrant's Common Equity\nMarket for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities \nOur common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CAH.”\nAt July 31, 2025, there were approximately 5,917 shareholders of record of our common shares.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future.

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, controls deemed effective now may become inadequate in the future because of changes in conditions, or because compliance with policies or procedures has deteriorated or been circumvented.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). Based on management’s assessment and the COSO criteria, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2025.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP’s report appears following this \"Management Reports\" section and expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n45\nReports\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated August 12, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nGrandview Heights, Ohio\nAugust 12, 2025\n \n46\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nReports\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and August 12, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which they relate.\nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n47\nReports\nValuation of Goodwill\nDescription of the Matter\nThe Company performed quantitative assessments of goodwill for the Company’s Navista & ION and Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions reporting units during fiscal year 2025, by comparing the fair values of each of these reporting units with their respective carrying amounts. As discussed in \nNotes 1 \nand \n5\n to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, or when indicators of impairment exist. During fiscal 2025, there was no impairment recognized related to Navista & ION or Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions.\nAuditing management’s goodwill impairment test for Navista & ION and Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions was challenging because there is significant judgement required in determining the fair values of the reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimates were sensitive to significant judgmental assumptions including the revenue growth rate; gross margin; distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses, and company-specific risk premium, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of significant judgmental assumptions, including the revenue growth rate; gross margin; distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses, and company-specific risk premium, among other assumptions.   \nTo test the estimated fair values of Navista & ION and Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating methodologies used; involving our valuation specialists to assist with our procedures related to the measurement of the fair values; and testing the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis for completeness and accuracy. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, recent historical performance, and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair values of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We evaluated the assumptions within the model and tested the model’s computational accuracy. In addition, we inspected the Company’s reconciliation of the fair value of all reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company and assessed the result. We have also assessed the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures included in \nNotes 1\n and \n5\n in relation to this matter.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\nGrandview Heights, Ohio\nAugust 12, 2025\n \n48\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nFinancial Statements\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nPage\nConsolidated Financial

Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nNotes to Financial Statements\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nCardinal Health, Inc. is a global healthcare services and products company providing customized solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems, pharmacies, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories, and physician offices. We provide pharmaceuticals and medical products and cost-effective solutions that enhance the healthcare system and supply chain efficiency. References to “we,” “our,” \"us,\" and similar pronouns in these consolidated financial statements are to Cardinal Health, Inc. and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nOur fiscal year ends on June 30. References to fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 in these consolidated financial statements are to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority-owned or consolidated subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany transactions and amounts have been eliminated. The results of businesses acquired or disposed of are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition or up to the date of disposal, respectively. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n \nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates, judgments, and assumptions are used in the accounting and disclosure related to, among other items, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and reserves, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment, vendor reserves, loss contingencies (including product liability and self-insurance accruals), and income taxes. Actual amounts may differ from these estimated amounts.\nCash Equivalents\nWe consider liquid investments purchased with an initial effective maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value.\nReceivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nTrade receivables are reported at their estimated collectible amounts and presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n213\n million and $\n233\n million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. In addition to credit losses, the allowance also includes reserves related to customer disputes and late fees billed to customers, which are recognized within our consolidated statements of earnings as reductions of revenue. An account is considered past due on the first day after its due date. In \naccordance with contract terms, we generally have the ability to charge customers service fees or higher prices if an account is considered past due. We regularly monitor past due accounts and establish appropriate reserves to cover potential losses, and consider historical experience, pricing discrepancies, the current economic environment, customer credit ratings or bankruptcies, and reasonable and supportable forecasts to develop our allowance for credit losses. We review these factors quarterly to determine if any adjustments are needed to the allowance. We write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accounts.\nWe provide financing to various customers. Such financing arrangements range from \n1\n year to \n5\n years at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation. Interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned. The financings may be collateralized, guaranteed by third parties or unsecured. Finance notes, net and related accrued interest were $\n32\n million (current portion $\n7\n million) and $\n43\n million (current portion $\n14\n million) at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and are included in other assets (current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other) in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance notes receivable allowance for doubtful accounts were $\n2\n million and $\n3\n million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We estimate an allowance for these financing receivables based on historical collection rates and the creditworthiness of the customer. We write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accounts.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nWe maintain cash depository accounts with major banks, and we invest in high quality, short-term liquid instruments, and in marketable securities. Our short-term liquid instruments mature within three months and we have not historically incurred any related losses.\nOur trade receivables and finance notes and related accrued interest are exposed to a concentration of credit risk with certain large customers and with customers in the retail and healthcare sectors. Credit risk can be affected by changes in reimbursement and other economic pressures impacting the healthcare industry. With respect to customers in the retail and healthcare sectors, such credit risk is limited due to supporting collateral and the diversity of the customer base, including its wide geographic dispersion. We perform regular credit evaluations of our customers’ financial conditions and maintain reserves for losses through the established allowance for doubtful accounts. Historically, such losses have been within our expectations. Refer to the \"Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\" section within this Note for additional information on the accounting treatment of reserves for allowance for doubtful accounts.\n \nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n55\nNotes to Financial Statements\nMajor Customers\nCVS Health Corporation (\"CVS Health\") is our only customer that individually accounted for at least 10 percent of revenue and/or gross trade receivables in fiscal 2025. In fiscal 2024, both CVS Health and OptumRx individually accounted for at least 10 percent of revenue and/or gross trade receivables. These customers were primarily serviced through our Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions (\"Pharma\") segment. Our pharmaceutical distribution contracts with OptumRx expired at the end of June 2024. \nThe following table summarizes historical percent of revenue and gross trade receivables from CVS Health and OptumRx:\nPercent of Revenue\nPercent of Gross Trade Receivables at June 30\n2025\n2024\n2023\n2025\n2024\nCVS Health\n30\n \n%\n24\n \n%\n25\n \n%\n26\n \n%\n22\n \n%\nOptumRx\n—\n17\n \n%\n16\n \n%\n—\n6\n \n%\nWe have entered into agreements with group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) which act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members. Vizient, Inc. and Premier, Inc. are our \ntwo\n largest GPO member relationships in terms of revenue. Sales to members of these \ntwo\n GPOs collectively accounted for \n27\n percent, \n16\n percent, and \n15\n percent of revenue for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Our trade receivable balances are with individual members of the GPO, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists with these types of arrangements\n.\nInventories\nA portion of our inventories (\n52\n percent and \n50\n percent at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively) are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method, or market. These inventories are included within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities of our Pharma segment (“distribution facilities”) and are primarily merchandise inventories. The LIFO method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold, so LIFO helps us better match current costs and revenue. We believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within the distribution facilities. As such, the LIFO reserve is the difference between (a) inventory at the lower of LIFO cost or market and (b) inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation.\nAt June 30, 2025 and 2024, inventories valued at LIFO cost were significantly in excess of the average cost value, respectively. We do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost. As such, we did not write-up the value of our inventory from average cost to LIFO cost at June 30, 2025 or 2024. \nOur remaining inventory, including inventory in our Global Medical Products and Distribution (\"GMPD\") segment and certain inventory in our Pharma segment, that is not valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market is stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices and estimated sales demand in the \nordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. \nWe reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience, historical and projected sales trends, specific categories of inventory, age and expiration dates of on-hand inventory, and manufacturer return policies. Inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were $\n132\n million and $\n149\n million at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nCash Discounts\nManufacturer cash discounts are recorded as a component of inventory cost and recognized as a reduction of cost of products sold as inventory is sold.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost less accumulated depreciation before the decision to dispose of the asset was made or fair value less cost to sell. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts.\nWe capitalize project costs relating to computer software developed or obtained for internal use when the activities related to the project reach the application stage. Costs that are associated with the preliminary stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as they are incurred.\nDepreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, including finance lease assets which are depreciated over the terms of their respective leases. We generally use the following range of useful lives for our property and equipment categories: buildings and improvements—\n3\n to \n39\n years; machinery and equipment—\n3\n to \n20\n years; capitalized software held for internal use—\n3\n to \n7\n years; and furniture and fixtures—\n3\n to \n7\n years. We recorded depreciation and amortization of capitalized software of $\n488\n million, $\n470\n million, and $\n441\n million for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table presents the components of property and equipment, net at June 30:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nLand, building, and improvements\n$\n2,178\n \n$\n1,879\n \nMachinery and equipment\n2,685\n \n2,367\n \nCapitalized software held for internal use\n1,940\n \n1,744\n \nFurniture and fixtures\n136\n \n128\n \nConstruction in progress\n577\n \n577\n \nTotal property and equipment, at cost\n7,516\n \n6,695\n \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n(\n4,658\n)\n(\n4,166\n)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n2,858\n \n$\n2,529\n \nRepairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. Interest on long-term projects is capitalized using a rate that approximates the weighted-average interest rate on long-term \n \n56\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nNotes to Financial Statements\nobligations, which was \n5\n percent at June 30, 2025. The amount of capitalized interest was immaterial for all periods presented.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including identifiable intangible assets, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions. Critical estimates and assumptions include: expected future cash flows for customer relationships, trade names, developed technology, and other identifiable intangible assets; discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows; and estimates of useful lives. When an acquisition involves contingent consideration, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date. The estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results, discount rates, discount periods, and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios. See \nNote 2\n for additional information regarding our acquisitions.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nPurchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist.\nPurchased goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. There is an option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for our annual goodwill impairment test in the current year. The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount. \nGoodwill impairment testing involves judgment, including the identification of reporting units, qualitative evaluation of events, and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, and, if necessary, the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit. Following the acquisitions of Integrated Oncology Network (\"ION\"), GI Alliance (\"GIA\"), Advanced Diabetes Supply Group (\"ADS\"), and Urology America we have reassessed our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. \nAs of June 30, 2025, our reporting units are: Pharma (excluding Navista & ION and GIA), Navista & ION, GIA, GMPD, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, OptiFreight\n®\n Logistics, at-Home Solutions, and ADS. We anticipate at-Home Solutions and ADS will be combined as a single reporting unit as the businesses are integrated in the future.\nFair value can be determined using market, income, or cost-based approaches. Our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the income-based and market-based approaches. Under the income-based approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, which we believe are consistent with those of a market participant, and include an estimate of long-term growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internally-developed forecasts. During fiscal 2025, discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from \n9.5\n to \n11\n percent. Under the market-based guideline public company method, we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. We also use the guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units. To further confirm fair value, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including forecasted operating results. The use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment.\nWe performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 for our reporting units, which included Navista & ION in fiscal 2025. Due to the recent timing of their acquisitions, GIA and ADS were not included in our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2025 as no indicators of impairment were present.\nDuring fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recognized goodwill impairment charges related to GMPD of $\n675 million\n and $\n1.2 billion\n, respectively, which were included in impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net in our consolidated statements of earnings. GMPD had no goodwill balance remaining as of March 31, 2024.\nWe concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill for the remaining reporting units, excluding GMPD, in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.\nThe impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If so, then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the respective asset's carrying amount. Our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and considers the weight of \nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n57\nNotes to Financial Statements\nevidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value, both positive and negative, in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.\nIntangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships; trademarks, trade names, and patents; and developed technology, are amortized using a combination of straight-line and accelerated methods based on the expected cash flows from the assets over their estimated useful lives. We review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the future forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. Actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts.\nAssets Held for Sale\nWe classify assets and liabilities (the “disposal group”) as held for sale when management commits to a plan to sell the disposal group in its present condition and at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. We also consider whether an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated and if it is probable that the sale will occur within one year without significant changes to the plan to sell. Upon classification of the disposal group as held for sale, we test the assets for impairment and cease related depreciation and amortization.\nIn June 2024, we signed an agreement to sell the West Campus Dublin, Ohio office space. At that time, we met the criteria for the related assets to be classified as held for sale. During fiscal 2025, the purchase agreement was terminated and the related assets were reclassified as assets held for use. We evaluated and recognized an impairment during fiscal 2025.\nInvestments\nInvestments in non-marketable equity securities are accounted for under the fair value, equity, or net asset value method of accounting and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. For equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, we use the fair value measurement alternative and measure the securities at cost less impairment, if any, including adjustments for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Our share of the earnings and losses are recorded in other (income)/expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. We monitor our investments for impairment by considering factors such as the operating performance of the investment and current economic and market conditions.\nLeases\nOur leases are primarily for corporate and physician offices, distribution facilities, vehicles, and equipment. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception by evaluating whether the arrangement conveys the right to use an identified asset and whether we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from and have the ability to direct the use of the asset. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease expense for operating lease assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate if it is readily determinable.\nOur lease agreements contain lease components and non-lease components. For all asset classes, we have elected to account for both of these components as a single lease component. We also, from time to time, sublease portions of our real estate property, resulting in sublease income. Sublease income and the related assets and cash flows are not material to the consolidated financial statements at or for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023.\nWe apply a practical expedient for short-term leases whereby we do not recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset for leases with a term of less than 12 months. Short-term lease expense recognized in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 was immaterial.\nOur leases have remaining lease terms from less than \n1\n year up to approximately \n17\n years. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain and there is a significant economic incentive to exercise that option.\nSee \nNote 6\n for additional information regarding leases.\nVendor Reserves\nIn the ordinary course of business, our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other disputes. These disputes are researched and resolved based upon the findings of the research performed. At any given time, there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution. In determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors, we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims. We have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review. Though the claim types are relatively consistent, we periodically update our reserve estimates to reflect actual historical experience. The ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than our original estimate and may require an adjustment. Adjustments to vendor reserves are included in cost of products sold. In addition, the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from period-to-period, timing of settlements and specific \n \n58\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nNotes to Financial Statements\nvendor issues. Vendor reserves were $\n96\n million and $\n112\n million at June 30, 2025 and 2024 respectively, excluding third-party returns. See \"Third-Party Returns\" section within this Note for a description of third-party returns.\nDistribution Services Agreement and Other Vendor Fees\nOur Pharma segment recognizes fees received from distribution services agreements and other fees received from vendors related to the purchase or distribution of the vendors’ inventory when those fees have been earned and we are entitled to payment. Since the benefit provided to a vendor is related to the purchase and distribution of the vendor’s inventory, we recognize the fees as a reduction in the carrying value of the inventory that generated the fees, and as such, a reduction of cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of earnings when the inventory is sold.\nLoss Contingencies and Self-Insurance\nLoss Contingencies\nWe accrue for contingencies related to disputes, litigation, and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nIn connection with the opioid litigation as described further in \nNote 8\n, we recorded pre-tax charges of $\n5.6\n billion\n \nduring fiscal 2021, which were retained at Corporate. In February 2022, we and two other national distributors announced that each company had determined that a sufficient number of political subdivisions had agreed to participate in the previously disclosed National Opioid Settlement Agreement (the \"NOSA\") to settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by states and local governmental entities. This NOSA became effective on April 2, 2022. \nDuring fiscal 2024, we reached agreements to settle claims brought by classes of third-party payors and acute care hospitals, and the City of Baltimore.\nWe develop and periodically update reserve estimates for all litigation matters, including the Cordis OptEase and TrapEase inferior vena cava (\"IVC\") claims received to date and expected to be received in the future and related costs. To project future IVC claim costs, we use a methodology based largely on recent experience, including claim filing rates, blended average payout influenced by claim severity, historical sales data, implant and injury to report lag patterns, and estimated defense costs. At June 30, 2025, we have a total of $\n56\n million accrued for losses and legal defense costs, related to the IVC filter product liability lawsuits in our consolidated balance sheets, which includes the $\n49\n million in the qualified settlement fund.\nThe amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from these estimates. We recognize these estimated loss contingencies, income from favorable resolution of litigation, and certain defense costs in litigation (recoveries)/charges, net in our consolidated statements of earnings. See \nNote 8\n for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits.\nSelf-Insurance\nWe self-insure for employee healthcare, general liability, certain product liability matters, auto liability, property, and workers' \ncompensation. Self-insurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements or pending claims, defense costs, administrative fees, claim adjustment costs, and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported. \nBecause these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies and other liabilities is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies and our self-insurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate. Any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.\nGuarantees\nIn the ordinary course of business, we agree to indemnify certain other parties under acquisition and disposition agreements, customer agreements, intellectual property licensing agreements, and other agreements. Such indemnification obligations vary in scope and, when defined, in duration. In many cases, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated, and therefore the overall maximum amount of the liability under such indemnification obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Where appropriate, such indemnification obligations are recorded as a liability. Historically, we have not, individually or in the aggregate, made payments under these indemnification obligations in any material amounts. In certain circumstances, we believe that existing insurance arrangements, subject to the general deduction and exclusion provisions, would cover portions of the liability that may arise from these indemnification obligations. In addition, we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under these indemnification obligations is not probable.\nFrom time to time we enter into agreements that obligate us to make fixed payments upon the occurrence of certain events. Such obligations primarily relate to obligations arising under acquisition transactions, where we have agreed to make payments based upon the achievement of certain financial performance measures by the acquired business. Generally, the obligation is capped at an explicit amount. There were no material obligations at June 30, 2025.\n \nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate. We assess the realizability of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realizability of deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction and also considers all available positive and negative evidence.\nDeferred taxes for non-U.S. liabilities are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested.\nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n59\nNotes to Financial Statements\nWe operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. \nTax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. For tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition, we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. \nSee \nNote 9\n for additional information regarding income taxes.\nOther Accrued Liabilities\nOther accrued liabilities represent various current obligations, including certain accrued operating expenses, accrued rebates, and taxes payable.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe evaluate our ownership, contractual, and other interests in entities to determine if they are a variable interest entity (“VIE”), if we have a variable interest in those entities, and the nature and extent of those interests. These evaluations may involve management judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical information, among other factors. Based on our evaluations, if we determine we are the primary beneficiary of such VIEs, we consolidate such entities into our financial statements.\nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nWe consolidate a VIE when we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE and, as a result, are considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. \nIn relation to the acquisition of GIA, we concluded that GIA is the primary beneficiary and it consolidates the VIEs. The GIA VIEs do not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of earnings or consolidated statements of cash flows. Total assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets for the GIA VIEs were $\n601\n million and $\n187\n million, respectively, as of June 30, 2025.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represent the portion of net earnings, comprehensive income, and net assets that is not attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. Noncontrolling interests as of June 30, 2025 primarily represents third-party equity interests in ION. See \nNote 2\n, for additional information on the acquisition of ION.\nShare-Based Compensation\nCardinal Health, Inc. Plan\nShare-based compensation provided to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The fair value of restricted share units \n(\"RSUs\") is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares. The fair value of performance share units (\"PSUs\"), which include a market-based condition, is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. \nThe key assumptions for the Monte Carlo valuation model are as follows:\nAward Year\nRisk-Free Interest Rate\n (2)\nExpected Volatility \n(3)\n2023\n3.12\n%\n32.41\n \n%\n2023 Modified\n (1)\n5.13\n%\n26.58\n \n%\n2024\n4.66\n%\n23.99\n \n%\n2025\n3.89\n%\n24.54\n \n%\n(1)    There was a modification of prior year awards in fiscal 2024 that required a new Monte Carlo Simulation valuation model.\n(2)    Based on the U.S. Treasury yields over a term comparable to the remaining performance period.\n(3)    Based on historical volatility and implied volatility indications.\n \nThe compensation expense associated with nonvested PSUs is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the performance goals being achieved. Based on the extent to which the performance goals are achieved and the Company's total shareholder return (\"TSR\") relative to the S&P 500 Health Care Index, vested shares may range from \nzero\n to \n240\n percent of the target award amount. Compensation expense is recognized regardless of the extent to which the market-based condition, the Company's relative TSR, is satisfied.\nThe compensation expense recognized for share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures and is recognized ratably over the service period of the awards. All income tax effects of share-based awards are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as awards vest or are settled. We classify share-based compensation expense in distribution, selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses to correspond with the same line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees. If awards are modified in connection with a restructuring activity, the incremental share-based compensation expense is classified in restructuring and employee severance. See \nNote 15\n for additional information regarding share-based compensation.\nGIA Share-Based Compensation\nGIA, a majority-owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health, maintains standalone share-based compensation plans. In connection with the acquisition of physician practices, GIA issues common units in GIA (collectively the “GIA Units”) to certain physicians and management. The GIA Units contain forfeiture provisions ranging from 36 to 60 months. These forfeiture provisions provide that the unit holders forfeit all or a portion of the GIA Units should they leave GIA, except in certain limited situations, effectively requiring the unit holders to stay employed with the physician practice managed by GIA in order to retain all of the granted GIA Units during the forfeiture period.\nThese GIA Units are classified as liabilities under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 718. The fair value of the vested GIA Units with no future service requirement are recorded as an assumed liability at the acquisition date. The fair value of GIA Units \n \n60\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nNotes to Financial Statements\nwith a future service requirement are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. \nThe fair value of the GIA Units is remeasured at each reporting period using a discounted cash flow method. The compensation costs recognized each period reflects the change in the fair value of the liability for the portion of the awards for which the requisite service has been rendered. \nSee \nNote 15\n for additional information regarding share-based compensation.\nDividends\nWe paid cash dividends per common share of $\n2.02\n, $\n2.00\n, and $\n1.98\n in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers.\nRevenue in our Pharma, GMPD, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, and at-Home Solutions operating segments is primarily related to the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products, which include both manufactured and sourced products, and we recognize at a point in time when title transfers to customers and we have no further obligation to provide services related to such merchandise. OptiFreight\n®\n Logistics revenue is related to shipping, freight management, and logistics management services. Service revenues are recognized over the period that services are provided to the customer, reduced by contractual adjustments to third-party payors, discounts and implicit price concessions to customers. Revenues derived from services from all segments are immaterial for all periods presented. \nWe are generally the principal in a transaction, therefore our revenue is primarily recorded on a gross basis. When we are a principal in a transaction, we have determined that we control the ability to direct the use of the product or service prior to transfer to a customer, are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the product or service to our customer, have discretion in establishing prices, and ultimately control the transfer of the product or services provided to the customer.\nSales Returns and Allowances\nRevenue is recorded net of sales returns and allowances. Revenues are measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, discounts, rebates, and other variable consideration. Sales returns are recorded based on estimates using historical data. Our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned, subject to restocking fees. We only allow customers to return products for credit in a condition suitable to be added back to inventory and resold at full value (“merchantable product”) or returned to vendors for credit. Product returns are generally consistent throughout the year and typically are not specific to any particular product or customer.\nWe accrue for estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon historical customer return trends, margin rates, and processing costs. Our accrual for sales returns is reflected as \na reduction of revenue and cost of products sold for the sales price and cost, respectively. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, the accrual for estimated sales returns and allowances was $\n447\n million and $\n441\n million, respectively, which is reflected in trade receivables, net and inventories, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Sales returns and allowances were $\n2.2\n billion, for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, and the net impact on net earnings in the consolidated statements of earnings was immaterial in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023. \nThird-Party Returns\nWe generally do not accept non-merchantable pharmaceutical product returns from our customers, so many of our customers return non-merchantable pharmaceutical products to the manufacturer through third parties. Since our customers generally do not have a direct relationship with manufacturers, our vendors pass the value of such returns to us (usually in the form of an accounts payable deduction). We, in turn, pass the value received to our customer. In certain instances, we pass the estimated value of the return to our customer prior to our receipt of the value from the vendor. Although we believe we have satisfactory protections, from time to time, we become subject to claims from customers or vendors that our administration of this overall process is deficient in some respect or our contractual terms with vendors are in conflict with our contractual terms with our customers. We maintain reserves for some of these situations based on their nature and our historical experience with their resolution.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs are primarily included in SG&A expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings and include all delivery expenses as well as all costs to prepare the product for shipment to the end customer. Shipping and handling costs were $\n909\n million, $\n866\n million, and $\n835\n million, for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\n \nRestructuring and Employee Severance\nRestructuring activities are programs that are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business, such as divestitures, closing and consolidating facilities, changing the way we manufacture or distribute our products, moving manufacturing of a product to another location, changes in production or business process outsourcing or insourcing, employee severance (including rationalizing headcount or other significant changes in personnel), and realigning operations (including realignment of the management structure in response to changing market conditions). Also included within restructuring and employee severance are employee severance costs that are not incurred in connection with a restructuring activity. See \nNote 4\n for additional information regarding our restructuring activities.\nAmortization and Other Acquisition-Related Costs\nWe classify certain costs incurred in connection with acquisitions as amortization and other acquisition-related costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. These costs consist of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, amortization as a result of basis differences in equity method investments, \nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n61\nNotes to Financial Statements\ntransaction costs, integration costs, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations. Transaction costs are incurred during the initial evaluation of a potential acquisition and primarily relate to costs to analyze, negotiate, and consummate the transaction as well as due diligence activities. Integration costs relate to activities required to combine the operations of an acquired enterprise into our operations and, in the case of the significant acquisitions with international operations, to stand-up the systems and processes needed to support an expanded geographic footprint. We record changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations relating to acquisitions as income or expense in amortization and other acquisition-related costs. See \nNote 5\n for additional information regarding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.\n \nTranslation of Foreign Currencies\nFinancial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are accumulated in shareholders’ equity through accumulated and other comprehensive loss (\"AOCI\") utilizing period-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses of these foreign subsidiaries are translated using average exchange rates during the year.\nThe foreign currency translation gains/(losses) included in AOCI at June 30, 2025 and 2024 are presented in \nNote 12\n. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses for the period are included in the consolidated statements of earnings in the respective financial statement line item.\nInterest Rate, Currency, and Commodity Risk\nAll derivative instruments are recognized at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and all changes in fair value are recognized in net earnings or shareholders’ equity through AOCI, net of tax.\nFor contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the hedge contracts must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed periodically. Any contract not designated as a hedge, or so designated but ineffective, is adjusted to fair value and recognized immediately in net earnings. If a fair value or cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the contract continues to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until settled and future adjustments to the contract’s fair value are recognized immediately in net earnings. If a forecasted transaction is probable not to occur, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are recognized immediately in net earnings. Interest payments received from the cross-currency swap are excluded from the net investment hedge effectiveness assessment and are recorded in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nSee \nNote 11\n for additional information regarding our derivative instruments, including the accounting treatment for instruments designated as fair value, cash flow, net investment, and economic hedges.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received upon selling an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date. It focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair values are:\nLevel 1 -    Observable prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 -    Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 3 -    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities.\nSee \nNote 10\n for additional information regarding fair value measurements.\nRecently Adopted Financial Accounting Standards\n.\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which enhances reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through disclosures of significant segment expenses. The Company adopted the new guidance in our fiscal 2025 Form 10-K. The new standard did not have an impact on the company's consolidated financial statements but required additional disclosures. See\n \nN\note 14\n for additional information.\nRecently Issued Financial Accounting Standards and Disclosure Rules Not Yet Adopted\n \nWe assess the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the FASB on our consolidated financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K.\nIncome Tax Disclosure\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This guidance also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. This guidance will be effective for us in our fiscal 2026 Form 10-K and should be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this guidance on our disclosures.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40), which requires \n \n62\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nNotes to Financial Statements\ndisaggregated disclosures of certain categories of expenses which are included in any relevant income statement expense caption on an annual and interim basis. Additionally, the guidance requires the disclosure of total selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity's definition of selling expenses. This guidance will be effective for us in our fiscal 2028 Form 10-K and should be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this guidance on our disclosures.\n2. Acquisitions \nAdvanced Diabetes Supply Group (\"ADS\")\nOn April 1, 2025, we completed the acquisition of ADS, one of the country's leading diabetic medical supplies providers to patients in the home, for a purchase price of approximately $\n1.1\n billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. ADS serves approximately 500,000 patients annually by providing diabetes therapies from leading manufacturers. ADS is part of our at-Home Solutions operating segment and we report ADS results in Other.\nWe financed the acquisition of ADS with a combination of cash on hand and cash proceeds from new debt financing as described in \nNote 6\n.\nTransaction and integration costs associated with the ADS acquisition were $\n31\n million during fiscal 2025.\nGI Alliance (\"GIA\")\nOn January 30, 2025, we completed the acquisition of a \n73\n percent ownership interest in GIA, a gastroenterology management services organization, for a purchase price of approximately $\n2.8\n billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Beginning on the third anniversary of the closing, we have the ability to exercise a call right to purchase up to 100 percent of the remaining outstanding interests. GIA's management services organization platform includes over 900 physicians across 345 practice locations in 20 states and has the ability to further expand both geographically and in other key therapeutic areas. \nWe have accounted for the acquisition of the ownership interest in GIA as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805. We consolidate the results of GIA in our consolidated financial statements and report those consolidated results within our Pharma segment. \nAdditionally, on May 30, 2025, we, through GIA, completed the acquisition of Urology America, a urology management services organization, for a purchase price of $\n360\n million in cash and GIA equity, subject to certain adjustments.\nTransaction and integration costs associated with the GIA acquisitions were $\n75\n million during fiscal 2025.\nIntegrated Oncology Network (\"ION\")\nOn December 2, 2024, we completed the acquisition of ION, a physician-led independent community oncology network, for a purchase price of $\n1.1\n billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. ION is a management services organization that supports more than 50 practice sites in 10 states representing more than 100 providers. ION supports a continuum of care across \nits member sites including medical oncology, radiation oncology, urology diagnostic testing, and other ancillary services. As part of the transaction, ION practices were integrated into Navista, our managed services organization intended to enhance efficiency for providers and patients, enable additional capabilities, and increase practice profitability of independent community oncologists. We report ION results within our Pharma segment. The portion of ION net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest holders is reported as a reduction to net earnings in the consolidated statements of earnings. The acquisition was funded with available cash on hand.\nTransaction and integration costs associated with the ION acquisition were $\n30\n million during fiscal 2025.\nSpecialty Networks\nOn March 18, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Specialty Networks for a purchase price of $\n1.2\n billion in cash. Specialty Networks creates clinical and economic value for providers and partners across multiple specialty group purchasing organizations (\"GPOs\"): UroGPO, Gastrologix and GastroGPO, and United Rheumatology. Specialty Networks results are reflected within our Pharma segment. \nTransaction and integration costs associated with the Specialty Network acquisition were $\n7\n million and $\n16\n million during fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectfully.\nThe acquisitions have positively impacted respective segment revenue and segment profit while increasing amortization and other acquisition-related costs and acquisition-related cash and share-based compensation costs during fiscal 2025.\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\nThe allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of Urology America, ADS, GIA, and ION are not yet finalized and are subject to adjustment as we complete the valuation analysis of these acquisitions. The purchase prices are also subject to adjustment based on working capital requirements as set forth in the acquisition agreement.\nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n63\nNotes to Financial Statements\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date for Urology America, ADS, GIA, ION, and Specialty Networks:\n(in millions)\nUrology America\nADS\nGIA\nION\nSpecialty \nNetworks\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nCustomer intangibles (1)\n$\n—\n \n$\n472\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n226\n \n$\n480\n \nTrade names (2)\n33\n \n28\n \n200\n \n73\n \n15\n \nDeveloped technology and Other (3)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n20\n \nNon-competition agreements (4)\n—\n \n—\n \n23\n \n—\n \n5\n \nTotal identifiable intangible assets acquired\n33\n \n500\n \n223\n \n299\n \n520\n \nIdentifiable net assets/(liabilities):\nCash and equivalents\n4\n \n14\n \n53\n \n8\n \n23\n \nTrade receivables, net\n24\n \n97\n \n191\n \n59\n \n17\n \nInventories\n3\n \n78\n \n21\n \n4\n \n—\n \nPrepaid expenses and other\n3\n \n8\n \n14\n \n5\n \n2\n \nProperty and equipment, net\n28\n \n1\n \n75\n \n39\n \n—\n \nOther assets\n41\n \n376\n \n312\n \n52\n \n—\n \nAccounts payable\n(\n20\n)\n(\n104\n)\n(\n89\n)\n(\n10\n)\n—\n \nCurrent portion of long-term obligations and other short-term borrowings\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \nOther accrued liabilities\n(\n11\n)\n(\n493\n)\n(\n173\n)\n(\n39\n)\n(\n13\n)\nLong-term obligations, less current portion\n(\n6\n)\n—\n \n(\n15\n)\n(\n14\n)\n—\n \nDeferred income taxes and other liabilities\n(\n46\n)\n(\n12\n)\n(\n947\n)\n(\n90\n)\n(\n120\n)\nTotal identifiable net assets/(liabilities) acquired\n53\n \n465\n \n(\n336\n)\n310\n \n429\n \nNoncontrolling interest\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n151\n)\n—\n \nGoodwill\n307\n \n578\n \n3,124\n \n910\n \n784\n \nTotal net assets acquired\n$\n360\n \n$\n1,043\n \n$\n2,788\n \n$\n1,069\n \n$\n1,213\n \n(1)    The weighted-average useful life of customer intangibles ranges from \n10\n years to \n20\n years.\n(2)    The weighted-average useful life of trade names ranges from \n2\n years to \n10\n years.\n(3)    The weighted-average useful life of developed technology and other is \n8\n years.\n(4)    The weighted-average useful life of non-competition agreements is \n4\n years.\nThe valuation of identifiable intangible assets utilizes significant unobservable inputs and thus represents a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. The discount rates used to arrive at the present values of the identifiable intangible assets for Urology America, ADS, GIA, ION, and Specialty Networks ranged from \n7\n to \n20\n percent, and reflect their internal rates of return and uncertainty in the cash flow projections, which is reflective of market participant assumptions.\nThe estimated fair value of ION customer intangibles (customer contracts) were determined using an income-based approach, which includes market participant expectations of the cash flows that an asset could generate over its remaining useful life, discounted back to present value using an appropriate rate of return.\nThe estimated fair value of ADS customer intangibles (payor contracts) were determined using a multi-period excess earnings method, which estimates an intangible asset's value based on the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (or “excess earnings”) attributable only to the intangible asset. \nThe fair value of the Urology America, ADS, GIA, and ION trademark intangible assets were determined utilizing the relief from royalty method, an income-based approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the trademarks and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate.\nThe fair value of the non-compete intangibles acquired from GIA were determined by applying the differential cash flow method which compares the present value of cash flows with and without the non-compete agreements in place.\nThe vested GIA Units were recognized at their acquisition date fair values of $\n739\n million in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The valuation of the GIA Units utilizes significant unobservable inputs and thus represents a recurring Level 3 fair value measurement. The fair value of the GIA Units was determined using a discount rate of \n9.5\n% and an estimated weighted average service period of \ntwo years\n. \nThe noncontrolling interest for ION was recognized at the acquisition-date fair value of $\n151\n million. \nThe allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Specialty Networks acquisition was finalized during fiscal 2025, resulting in goodwill of $\n784\n million. There were no significant adjustments to the allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Specialty Networks acquisition from those disclosed in our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K.\n3. Divestitures\nOutcomes\nOn June 5, 2023, we signed a definitive agreement to contribute the Outcomes™ business to TDS, a portfolio company of BlackRock Long Term Private Capital and GTCR, in exchange for a \n16\n percent equity interest in the combined entity. The transaction closed on July 10, 2023 and we recognized a pre-tax gain of $\n53\n million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was included in \nimpairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net\n in our consolidated statements of earnings. This gain includes our initial recognition of an equity method investment in the combined entity for $\n147\n million, which was recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe determined that the divestiture of the Outcomes™ business does not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued \n \n64\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nNotes to Financial Statements\noperations. The Outcomes™ business operated and its results were reported within our Pharma segment before the divestiture.\n4. Restructuring and Employee Severance \nThe following table summarizes restructuring and employee severance costs:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nEmployee-related costs \n$\n61\n \n$\n95\n \n$\n39\n \nFacility exit and other costs \n27\n \n80\n \n56\n \nTotal restructuring and employee severance\n$\n88\n \n$\n175\n \n$\n95\n \nEmployee-related costs primarily consist of termination benefits provided to employees who have been involuntarily terminated, duplicate payroll costs, and retention bonuses incurred during transition periods. Facility exit and other costs primarily consist of project consulting fees, accelerated depreciation, professional project management and other service fees to support divestitures, costs associated with vacant facilities, and certain other divestiture-related costs.\nRestructuring and employee severance costs in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 include costs related to certain initiatives to rationalize our manufacturing operations and the implementation of certain enterprise-wide cost-savings measures. The increase in restructuring and employee severance in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to estimated severance costs related to these cost-savings measures and costs related to certain projects resulting from the reviews of our strategy, portfolio, capital-allocation framework, and operations. During fiscal 2023, restructuring and employee severance included costs related to the divestiture of the Cordis business.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to liabilities associated with restructuring and employee severance:\n(in millions)\nEmployee-\nRelated Costs\nFacility Exit\nand Other Costs\nTotal\nBalance at June 30, 2023\n$\n44\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n46\n \nAdditions\n74\n \n13\n \n87\n \nPayments and other adjustments\n(\n26\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n36\n)\nBalance at June 30, 2024\n92\n \n5\n \n97\n \nAdditions\n40\n \n—\n \n40\n \nPayments and other adjustments\n(\n53\n)\n(\n5\n)\n(\n58\n)\nBalance at June 30, 2025\n$\n79\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n79\n \n5.

The increase in the Other segment goodwill is due to the ADS acquisition that occurred during fiscal 2025. Goodwill recognized in connection with these acquisitions primarily represent the expected benefits from the expected growth from new customers, the assembled workforce of the acquired entities, and synergies of integrating these businesses. Substantially all of the goodwill recorded is expected to be nondeductible for income tax purposes.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we did not identify any indicators of impairment within our reporting units.\nWe performed interim quantitative goodwill impairment testing for GMPD at September 30, 2023 and March 31, 2024, which resulted in pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $\n585\n million and $\n90\n million, respectively. GMPD goodwill was fully impaired during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. During fiscal 2023, GMPD had cumulative pre-tax impairment charges of $\n1.2\n billion. These goodwill impairment charges are recorded in impairments and \nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n65\nNotes to Financial Statements\n(gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net in our consolidated statements of earnings. \nIn connection with the divestiture of the Outcomes business, during fiscal 2023, we allocated and reclassified $\n24\n million of goodwill from the Pharma operating segment to the Outcomes disposal group based on the estimated relative fair values of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that was retained.\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe following tables summarize other intangible assets by class at June 30:\n2025\n(in millions)\nGross\nIntangible\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nIntangible\nWeighted- Average Remaining Amortization Period (Years)\nIndefinite-life intangibles:\nTrademarks and patents\n$\n13\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n13\n \nN/A\nTotal indefinite-life intangibles\n13\n \n—\n \n13\n \nN/A\nDefinite-life intangibles:\nCustomer intangibles\n3,876\n \n2,639\n \n1,237\n \n11\nTrademarks, trade names, and patents\n1,340\n \n459\n \n881\n \n8\nDeveloped technology and other\n1,030\n \n726\n \n304\n \n6\nNon-Competition Agreements\n72\n \n21\n \n51\n \n4\nTotal definite-life intangibles\n6,318\n \n3,845\n \n2,473\n \n10\nTotal other intangible assets\n$\n6,331\n \n$\n3,845\n \n$\n2,486\n \nN/A\n2024\n(in millions)\nGross\nIntangible\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nIntangible\nIndefinite-life intangibles:\nTrademarks and patents\n$\n12\n \n$\n— \n$\n12\n \nTotal indefinite-life intangibles\n12\n \n— \n12\n \nDefinite-life intangibles:\nCustomer intangibles\n3,628\n \n2,431\n \n1,197\n \nTrademarks, trade names, and patents\n561\n \n408\n \n153\n \nDeveloped technology and other\n1,047\n \n684\n \n363\n \nTotal definite-life intangibles\n5,236\n \n3,523\n \n1,713\n \nTotal other intangible assets\n$\n5,248\n \n$\n3,523\n \n$\n1,725\n \nThe increase in definite-life intangibles is primarily due to the ADS, GIA, and ION acquisitions.

The 7.0% Debentures represent unsecured obligations of Allegiance Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary), which Cardinal Health, Inc. has guaranteed. None of these obligations are subject to a sinking fund and the Allegiance obligations are not redeemable prior to maturity. Interest is paid pursuant to the terms of the obligations. These notes are effectively subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries, including trade payables of $\n34.7\n billion and $\n31.8\n billion at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we issued additional debt, with the aggregate principal amount of $\n2.9\n billion, to fund a portion of the consideration payable in connection with the GIA and ADS acquisitions and for general purposes. The notes issued are $\n500\n million aggregate principal amount of 4.7% Notes that mature on November 15, 2026, $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% Notes that mature on November 15, 2029, $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of 5.35% Notes that mature on \nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n67\nNotes to Financial Statements\nNovember 15, 2034, and \n$\n650\n million\n aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Notes that mature on November 15, 2054. The proceeds of the notes issued, net of discounts, premiums, and debt issuance costs, were $\n2.9\n billion.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we repaid the full principal of $\n400\n million of the 3.5% Notes due 2024 at maturity with proceeds from the debt issuance in fiscal 2024, $\n200\n million of which were invested in short-term time deposits and classified as prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2024. All short-term time deposits related to the debt issuance in fiscal 2024 have matured.\nDuring fiscal 2024, we issued additional debt with the aggregate principal amount of $\n1.15\n billion to fund the repayment of all of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 3.5% Notes due 2024 and 3.079% Notes due 2024, at their respective maturities, and for general corporate purposes. During fiscal 2024, we repaid the full principal of $\n750\n million of the 3.079% Notes due 2024 at maturity. The notes issued are $\n650\n million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Notes that mature on February 15, 2029 and $\n500\n million aggregate principal amount of 5.45% Notes that mature on February 15, 2034. The proceeds of the notes issued, net of discounts, premiums, and debt issuance costs were $\n1.14\n billion.\nIf we undergo a change of control, as defined in the notes, and if the notes receive specified ratings below investment grade by each of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Moody’s Investors Services and Fitch Ratings, any holder of the notes, excluding the debentures, can require with respect to the notes owned by such holder, or we can offer, to repurchase the notes at \n101\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOther Financing Arrangements\nIn addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow, other sources of liquidity include a $\n3.0\n billion commercial paper program backed by a $\n2.0\n billion revolving credit facility that expires in February 2028 and a $\n1.0\n billion \n364\n-Day revolving credit facility that expires in October 2025. We also have a $\n1.0\n billion committed receivables sales facility. \nOn December 5, 2024, we entered into a term loan credit agreement that, among other things, provides commitments for a term loan facility in an aggregate amount of up to $\n1.0\n billion. On April 1, 2025, we closed on our acquisition of ADS and borrowed $\n800\n million under this term loan facility. The loan provided under this term loan credit agreement will mature in April 2028 and allows for prepayment, which may be accelerated pursuant to certain conditions specified in the credit agreement. Interest rates on borrowings will be based on prevailing interest rates, benchmarked based on Term SOFR and subject to our credit ratings.\nIn November 2024, we also obtained a commitment letter from a financial institution for a $\n2.9\n billion unsecured bridge term loan facility that could have been used to complete the acquisition of GIA. We incurred fees related to the facility, which are included in interest expense, net. The unsecured bridge term loan facility was never entered into and we terminated the commitment letter on November 22, 2024.\nIn February 2023, we extended our $\n2.0\n billion revolving credit facility through February 25, 2028. In September 2022, we renewed our committed receivables sales facility program through Cardinal Health Funding, LLC (“CHF”) through September 30, 2025. In September 2023, Cardinal Health 23 Funding, LLC (\"CH-23 Funding\") was added as a seller under our committed receivables sales facility. Each of CHF and CH-23 Funding was organized for\n \nthe sole purpose of buying receivables and selling undivided interests in those receivables to third-party purchasers. Although consolidated with Cardinal Health, Inc. in accordance with GAAP, each of CHF and CH-23 Funding is a separate legal entity from Cardinal Health, Inc. and from our respective subsidiary that sells receivables to CHF or CH-23 Funding, as applicable. Each of CHF and CH-23 Funding is designed to be a special purpose, bankruptcy-remote entity whose assets are available solely to satisfy the claims of its respective creditors. \nOur revolving credit and committed receivables sales facilities require us to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of no more than 3.75-to-1. As of June 30, 2025, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.\nAt June 30, 2025 and 2024, we had \nno\n amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility; however, availability was reduced by outstanding letters of credit of $\n1\n million at both June 30, 2025 and 2024.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we had a daily maximum amount outstanding under our commercial paper and committed receivables programs of $\n633\n million.\nWe had \nno\n amounts outstanding as of June 30, 2025 under the committed receivables sales facility program; however, availability was reduced by outstanding standby letters of credit of $\n31\n million at both June 30, 2025 and 2024. \nWe had \nno\n amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of June 30, 2025 and 2024. \nThe $\n213\n million and $\n110\n million balance of other obligations at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, consisted of finance leases and short-term borrowings.\n \n68\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nNotes to Financial Statements\n8. Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Litigation \nCommitments\nGeneric Sourcing Venture with CVS Health\nIn July 2014, we established Red Oak Sourcing, LLC (\"Red Oak Sourcing\"), a U.S.-based generic pharmaceutical sourcing venture with CVS Health for an initial term of \n10\n years. Red Oak Sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of its participants. In August 2021, we amended our agreement to extend the term through June 2029. We are required to make quarterly payments to CVS Health for the term of the arrangement.\nContingencies\nNew York Opioid Stewardship Act\nIn 2018, the State of New York adopted the Opioid Stewardship Act (the \"OSA\"), which created an aggregate $\n100\n million annual assessment on all manufacturers and distributors that was assessed based on each manufacturer or distributor's share of the total morphine milligram equivalents sold or distributed in New York, the applicability of which was ultimately limited to two years (2017 and 2018).\nSince fiscal 2021, we have made certain payments to New York State for our portion of the assessment. However, we, and other distributors, challenged the OSA as unconstitutional. In May 2024, the New York Appellate Division held that the 2017 assessment was unconstitutionally retroactive, directing a refund of assessments paid for calendar year 2017, but upheld the 2018 assessment. In fiscal 2025, both parties agreed to a settlement which will result in a refund of the portion we paid for calendar year 2017. The refund will be recognized upon receipt of the settlement.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe become involved from time to time in disputes, litigation, and regulatory matters.\nFrom time to time, we determine that products we distribute, source, manufacture, or market do not meet our specifications, regulatory requirements, or published standards. When we or a regulatory agency identify a potential quality or regulatory issue, we investigate and take appropriate corrective action. Such actions have led to product recalls, costs to repair or replace affected products, temporary interruptions in product sales, restrictions on importation, product liability claims and lawsuits, and can lead to action by regulators. Even absent an identified regulatory or quality issue or product recall, we can become subject to product liability claims and lawsuits.\nFrom time to time, we become aware through employees, internal audits, or other parties of possible compliance matters, such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting, internal accounting controls, financial reporting, auditing, or other ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws such as healthcare fraud and abuse, anti-corruption, or anti-bribery laws. When we become aware of such possible compliance matters, we investigate internally and take appropriate corrective action. In addition, from time to time, we receive subpoenas or requests for information \nfrom various federal or state agencies relating to our business or to the business of a customer, supplier, or other industry participants. Internal investigations, subpoenas, or requests for information could directly or indirectly lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against us or result in sanctions.\nWe have been named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private third parties. In such actions, the private parties purport to act on behalf of federal or state governments, allege that false claims have been submitted for payment by the government and may receive an award if their claims are successful. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. If the government declines to intervene, the private party may nonetheless attempt to continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own purporting to act on behalf of the government.\nWe accrue for contingencies related to disputes, litigation, and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates.\nWe recognize income from the favorable outcome of litigation when we receive the associated cash or assets.\nWe recognize estimated loss contingencies for certain litigation and regulatory matters and income from favorable resolution of litigation in litigation (recoveries)/charges, net in our consolidated statements of earnings; however, losses and recoveries of lost profits from disputes that occur in the ordinary course of business are included within segment profit.\nBecause loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review litigation matters to determine whether an accrual is appropriate or, where applicable, whether our accrual is adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from amounts accrued, whether as a result of settlement discussions, a judicial decision or verdict, or otherwise. Unless otherwise disclosed, we are not able to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, or additional losses for these matters.\nOpioid Lawsuits and Investigations\nAs of June 30, 2025, we have $\n4.9\n billion accrued for the opioid-related matters described below, of which $\n628\n million is included in other accrued liabilities and the remainder is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2025, we made payments totaling $\n798\n million, which included our fourth annual payment under the agreement to settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by states and local governmental entities and payments related to the \nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n69\nNotes to Financial Statements\nsettlement agreements with the City of Baltimore and classes of third-party payors and acute care hospitals.\nDuring fiscal 2025, there were no material expenses recognized for these matters. During fiscal 2024, we recognized expense of $\n340\n million in connection with opioid-related matters, including agreements to settle claims brought by classes of third-party payors and acute care hospitals, and settlements with the City of Baltimore and the State of Alabama. This expense was partially offset by a benefit of $\n105\n million related to prepayments at a prenegotiated discount of certain future payments totaling $\n344\n million.\nStates & Political Subdivisions\nIn April 2022, we along with two other national distributors (collectively, the \"Distributors\"), without admitting liability or wrongdoing, became parties to the NOSA to settle the vast majority lawsuits and claims brought by states and political subdivisions related to the distribution of opioid pain medications. In addition to the Distributors, parties to the NOSA include \n48\n states, the District of Columbia, and \n5\n U.S. territories. The NOSA also resulted in the resolution of the opioid-related claims of over 99 percent of political subdivisions in settling states (together with settling states and territories, the “Settling Governmental Entities\").\nThrough July 2025, we have paid the Settling Governmental Entities approximately $\n2.2\n billion and we expect to pay Settling Governmental Entities additional amounts up to $\n4.1\n billion through 2038. As required under the NOSA, a monitor is overseeing compliance with the Injunctive Relief provisions of the NOSA until 2027 and the distributors have engaged a third-party vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting, which distributors will fund until 2032.\nDuring fiscal 2024, we recognized a $\n22\n million charge in litigation (recoveries)/charge, net in the consolidated statements of earnings related to agreements with the Alabama Attorney General to pay approximately $\n123\n million to the State of Alabama over a period of ten years and with the City of Baltimore to resolve their opioid-related claims for approximately $\n153\n million.\nWest Virginia subdivisions and Native American tribes were not a part of the NOSA. In July 2022, a judgment in favor of the Distributors was entered in bench trial before a federal judge in West Virginia in a case brought by Cabell County and City of Huntington Plaintiffs have appealed this decision to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In July 2022, we entered into separate agreements to settle the opioid-related claims of the majority of remaining West Virginia subdivisions and Native American Tribes for approximately $\n124\n million over eleven years and $\n136\n million over five years, respectively.\nWe have now resolved the opioid-related claims of all \n50\n states and the District of Columbia.\nPrivate Plaintiffs\nThe NOSA does not address claims by private parties, which includes unions and other health and welfare funds, hospital systems and other healthcare providers, businesses, and individuals alleging personal injury. There were approximately \n291\n \nlawsuits brought by private plaintiffs pending as of August 8, 2025. Of these, approximately \n11\n are purported class actions. The causes of action asserted by these plaintiffs are similar to those asserted by public plaintiffs. We are vigorously defending ourselves in all these matters.\nFollowing resolution discussions with certain private plaintiffs during the six months ended December 31, 2024, Distributors finalized agreements with classes of third-party payors and acute care hospitals. Our portion of these settlements totaled $\n213\n million. The settlement with the class of third-party payors was approved by the court in January 2025 and was finalized in August 2025. The settlement with the class of acute care hospitals was approved by the court in March 2025 and became final in April 2025.\nInsurance Litigation\nWe are involved in ongoing legal proceedings with insurers related to their obligations to reimburse us for defense and indemnity costs in connection with the lawsuits described above. We received insurance recoveries related to these matters of $\n25\n million and $\n34\n million during fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. $\n12\n million of the recoveries from our insurers in fiscal 2025 were recorded in the Pharma segment. We have not recorded a receivable for any additional recoveries related to these insurance litigation matters as of June 30, 2025. \nDepartment of Justice Civil Investigative Demand\nIn November 2023, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (\"CID\") from the Department of Justice focused on potential violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act in connection with a 2022 transaction in which we purchased a minority ownership interest in a rheumatology managed services organization and a group purchasing organization. We are cooperating with this investigation.\nCordis IVC Filter Matters\nWe have been named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits involving claims by plaintiffs that allege personal injuries associated with the use of IVC filter products. These lawsuits sought a variety of remedies, including unspecified monetary damages. The divestiture of the Cordis business did not include product liability related to the IVC filters in the U.S. and Canada, which we retained.\nIn April 2023, we executed a settlement agreement that, if certain conditions are satisfied, will resolve approximately \n4,375\n claims for $\n275\n million. Between May and September 2023, we made settlement payments totaling $\n275\n million into a qualified settlement fund. During the three months ended December 31, 2024, the minimum required sign-on threshold was met, and beginning in January 2025, payments to qualified implantees were being made out of the qualified settlement fund. We expect continued payments out of the qualified settlement fund as additional plaintiffs meet the procedural requirements.\n \n70\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nNotes to Financial Statements\nWe have also entered into other agreements, which, in addition to the settlement discussed above, resolved the vast majority of IVC filter product liability claims. These settlements will not resolve all IVC filter product liability claims, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in the remaining lawsuits.\nWe recognized income of $\n103\n million during fiscal 2023, primarily related to a reduction of the reserve for the estimated settlement and defense costs for these matters due to the execution of the settlements noted above. At June 30, 2025, we have a total of $\n56\n million accrued for losses and legal defense costs, related to the IVC filter product liability lawsuits in our consolidated balance sheets, which includes the $\n49\n million in the qualified settlement fund.\nOther Civil Litigation \nGeneric Pharmaceutical Pricing Antitrust Litigation \nIn December 2019, pharmaceutical distributors including us were added as defendants in a civil class action lawsuit filed by indirect purchasers of generic drugs, such as hospitals and retail pharmacies. The indirect purchaser case is part of a multidistrict litigation consisting of multiple individual class action matters consolidated in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The indirect purchaser plaintiffs allege that pharmaceutical distributors encouraged manufacturers to increase prices, provided anti-competitive pricing information to manufacturers, and improperly engaged in customer allocation. In May 2020, the court granted our motion to dismiss. In July 2022, the indirect purchasers filed an amended complaint and, in August 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. In February 2025, the court granted our motion to dismiss, with prejudice.\nAntitrust Litigation Proceeds\nWe recognized income for net recoveries in class action antitrust lawsuits in which we were a class member or plaintiff of $\n171\n million, $\n117\n million, and\n \n$\n130\n million during fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\n9.

The net tax benefits related to these charges were $\n58\n million and $\n92\n million during fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate:\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nProvision at Federal statutory rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nState and local income taxes, net of federal benefit\n4.0\n \n3.1\n \n6.5\n \nTax effect of foreign operations\n0.2\n \n(\n1.6\n)\n(\n5.4\n)\nNondeductible/nontaxable items\n0.7\n \n(\n0.1\n)\n(\n1.1\n)\nImpact of Divestitures\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1.9\n)\nWithholding Taxes\n0.3\n \n1.0\n \n1.0\n \nChange in Valuation Allowances\n0.1\n \n(\n1.1\n)\n(\n5.1\n)\nUS Taxes on International Income (1)\n(\n1.3\n)\n(\n2.1\n)\n0.6\n \nImpact of Resolutions with IRS and other related matters \n(\n0.1\n)\n0.4\n \n0.3\n \nOpioid litigation\n0.2\n \n1.0\n \n0.1\n \nGoodwill Impairment\n—\n \n8.7\n \n33.8\n \nSpecialty Alliance Share-based Compensation\n1.4\n \n—\n \n—\n \nOther \n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n1.4\n)\n0.2\n \nEffective income tax rate\n25.3\n \n%\n28.9\n \n%\n50.0\n \n%\n \n(1)    Includes the tax impact of the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (\"FDII\") deduction offset by Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") tax, and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code.\n \nThe income tax rate was \n25.3\n%, \n28.9\n%, and \n50.0\n% in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Included in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 were non-deductible share based compensation costs for The Specialty Alliance and non-deductible transaction costs. Included in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was \nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n71\nNotes to Financial Statements\n$\n58\n million and $\n92\n million of benefit, respectively, related to goodwill impairment charges related to our GMPD segment. Additionally, laws governing insurance coverage vary by state and some state courts have interpreted laws and insurance policies in ways that may impact our self-insurance loss, which could negatively impact our financial position.\nOur effective tax rate has benefits from negotiated lower than statutory tax rates in select foreign jurisdictions which individually are not material to our effective tax rate but in aggregate had a favorable tax impact of approximately $\n17\n million during fiscal 2025.\nAs of June 30, 2025, foreign earnings of approximately $\n1.0\n billion are considered indefinitely reinvested for working capital and other offshore investment needs. The computation of tax required if those earnings are repatriated is not practicable. For amounts not considered indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded an immaterial amount of income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2025. \nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. \nThe following table presents the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at June 30:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nDeferred income tax assets:\nReceivable basis difference\n$\n26\n \n$\n81\n \nAccrued liabilities\n651\n \n749\n \nShare-based compensation\n23\n \n28\n \nLoss and tax credit carryforwards\n386\n \n512\n \nDeferred tax assets related to uncertain tax positions\n47\n \n45\n \nOther\n97\n \n76\n \nTotal deferred income tax assets\n1,230\n \n1,491\n \nValuation allowance for deferred income tax assets\n(\n254\n)\n(\n300\n)\nNet deferred income tax assets\n$\n976\n \n$\n1,191\n \nDeferred income tax liabilities:\nInventory basis differences\n$\n(\n1,103\n)\n$\n(\n1,122\n)\nProperty-related\n(\n358\n)\n(\n350\n)\nGoodwill and other intangibles\n(\n834\n)\n(\n710\n)\nSelf-Insurance\n(\n981\n)\n(\n981\n)\nTotal deferred income tax liabilities\n$\n(\n3,276\n)\n$\n(\n3,163\n)\nNet deferred income tax liability\n$\n(\n2,300\n)\n$\n(\n1,972\n)\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities in the preceding table, after netting by taxing jurisdiction and for uncertain tax positions, are in the following captions in the consolidated balance sheets at June 30:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nNoncurrent deferred income tax asset (1)\n$\n64\n \n$\n72\n \nNoncurrent deferred income tax liability (2)\n(\n2,364\n)\n(\n2,044\n)\nNet deferred income tax liability\n$\n(\n2,300\n)\n$\n(\n1,972\n)\n(1)\nIncluded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)\nIncluded in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAt June 30, 2025 we had gross federal, state, and international loss and credit carryforwards of $\n154\n million, $\n11.6\n billion, and $\n1.1\n billion, respectively, the tax effect of which is an aggregate deferred tax asset of $\n386\n million. Substantially all of these carryforwards are available for at least three years. Approximately $\n244\n million of the valuation allowance at June 30, 2025 applies to certain federal, state, and international loss carryforwards that, in our opinion, are more likely than not to expire unutilized. However, to the extent that tax benefits related\n \nto these carryforwards are realized in the future, the reduction in the valuation allowance would reduce income tax expense.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nWe had $\n879\n million, $\n981\n million, and $\n1.0\n billion of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023 balances include $\n871\n million, $\n882\n million, and $\n878\n million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would have an impact on the effective tax rate. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility. Recognition of these tax benefits would not affect our effective tax rate. We include the full amount of unrecognized tax benefits in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nBalance at beginning of fiscal year\n$\n981\n \n$\n1,015\n \n$\n948\n \nAdditions for tax positions of the current year\n8\n \n30\n \n25\n \nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n15\n \n28\n \n133\n \nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n(\n101\n)\n(\n87\n)\n(\n16\n)\nSettlements with tax authorities \n(\n22\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n73\n)\nExpiration of the statute of limitations \n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nBalance at end of fiscal year\n$\n879\n \n$\n981\n \n$\n1,015\n \nIt is reasonably possible that there could be a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months due to activities of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") or other taxing authorities, possible settlement of IRS and other audit issues, reassessment of existing unrecognized tax benefits, or the expiration of statutes of limitations. We expect any changes to the unrecognized benefits in the next 12 months will not be material.\n \n72\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nNotes to Financial Statements\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. At June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we had $\n65\n million, $\n65\n million, and $\n65\n million, respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties. These balances are gross amounts before any tax benefits and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As a result of our IRS audit settlements and carryback claim, an immaterial amount of interest was recorded in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023.\nOther Tax Matters\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state and local jurisdictions, and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2015 through the current fiscal year. \nExpiring or unusable loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly based on available information. This information may support either an increase or a decrease in the required valuation allowance. After applying the valuation allowances, we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above. We operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation.\n10. Fair Value Measurements \nThe following tables present the fair values for assets and (liabilities) measured on a recurring basis at June 30:\n2025\n(in millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets:\nCash equivalents\n$\n1,672\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,672\n \nOther investments (1)\n108\n \n—\n \n—\n \n108\n \nLiabilities:\nForward contracts (2)\n—\n \n(\n48\n)\n—\n \n(\n48\n)\nShare-based awards (3)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n843\n)\n(\n843\n)\n2024\n(in millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets:\nCash equivalents\n$\n1,442\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,442\n \nOther investments (1)\n108\n \n—\n \n—\n \n108\n \nLiabilities:\nForward contracts (2)\n—\n \n(\n87\n)\n—\n \n(\n87\n)\n(1)\nThe other investments balance includes investments in mutual funds, which offset fluctuations in deferred compensation liabilities. These mutual funds invest in the equity securities of companies with both large and small market capitalization and high-quality fixed income debt securities. The fair value of these investments is determined using quoted market prices.\n(2)\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps, foreign currency contracts, and net investment hedges is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved, including non-performance \nrisk, and using discount rates appropriate for the respective maturities. Observable Level 2 inputs are used to determine the present value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of these derivative contracts, which are subject to master netting arrangements under certain circumstances, is presented on a gross basis in prepaid expenses and other, other assets, other accrued liabilities, and deferred income taxes and other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets.\n(3)\nThe shared-based awards are comprised of liability-classified awards, as defined under ASC 718, resulting from the acquisition of GIA. The fair value of the GIA Units is determined using the discounted cash flow method. These are presented in deferred income taxes and other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. See \nNote 15\n for additional information.\n11. Financial Instruments \nWe utilize derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to certain risks related to our ongoing operations. The primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments include interest rate risk, currency exchange risk, and commodity price risk. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. While the majority of our derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, we also enter into derivative instruments that are designed to hedge a risk but are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivative instruments are adjusted to current fair value through earnings at the end of each period. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative instruments. Accordingly, we have established and maintain strict counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative instruments with major financial institutions that are rated investment grade or better. We do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty and we believe the risk of loss is remote. Additionally, we do not require collateral under these agreements.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. Our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on cash flows and the market value of our borrowings. We utilize a mix of debt maturities on our fixed-rate debt to manage changes in interest rates. In addition, we enter into interest rate swaps to further manage our exposure to interest rate variations related to our borrowings and to lower our overall borrowing costs.\nCurrency Exchange Risk Management\nWe conduct business in several major international currencies and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. Our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on business operations. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments, and anticipated foreign currency revenue and expenses.\nCommodity Price Risk Management\nWe are exposed to changes in the price of certain commodities. Our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with forecasted purchases of these commodities to allow management to focus its attention on business operations. Accordingly, we enter into derivative contracts when possible to \nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n73\nNotes to Financial Statements\nmanage the price risk associated with certain forecasted purchases.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of our assets and liabilities related to derivatives designated as hedging instruments and the respective line items in which they were recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at June 30:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nAssets:\nCross-currency swap (1)\n$\n—\n \n$\n12\n \nForeign currency contracts (1)\n6\n \n1\n \nPay-floating interest rate swaps (1)\n14\n \n3 \nTotal assets\n$\n20\n \n$\n16\n \nLiabilities:\nCross-currency swap (2)\n$\n24\n \n$\n1\n \nForeign currency contracts (2)\n1\n \n8\n \nPay-floating interest rate swaps (2)\n43\n \n94\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n68\n \n$\n103\n \n(1)    Included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)    Included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe enter into pay-floating interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest rates. These contracts are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Accordingly, the gain or loss recorded on the pay-floating interest rate swaps is directly offset by the change in fair value of the underlying debt. Both the derivative instrument and the underlying debt are adjusted to market value at the end of each period with any resulting gain or loss recorded in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. During fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 there were \nno\n gains or losses recorded to interest expense as changes in the market value of our derivative instruments offset changes in the market value of the underlying debt.\nDuring fiscal 2024 and 2023, we entered into pay-floating interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $\n500\n million, and $\n300\n million, respectively. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following tables summarize the outstanding interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges at June 30, 2025 and 2024:\n(in millions)\nNotional Amount\nMaturity Date\nPay-floating interest rate swaps\n$\n1,600\n \nJun 2027\n-\nFeb 2031\nThe following table summarizes the gain/(loss) recognized in earnings for interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nPay-floating interest rate swaps (1)\n$\n51\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n50\n)\nFixed-rate debt (1)\n(\n51\n)\n(\n2\n)\n50\n \n(1)     Included in \ninterest expense, net\n in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe enter into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity price fluctuations associated with certain forecasted transactions. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. \nGains currently included within accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cash flow hedges to be reclassified into net earnings within the next 12 months are $\n5\n million.\nWe enter into foreign currency contracts to protect the value of anticipated foreign currency revenues and expenses. At June 30, 2025 and 2024, we held contracts to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, revenue and expenses. The principal currencies hedged are the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi, Thai baht, and Philippine peso.\nWe enter into commodity contracts to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of certain commodities used in our GMPD segment.\nThe following tables summarize the outstanding cash flow hedges at June 30:\n \n2025\n(in millions)\nNotional Amount\nMaturity Date\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n381\n \nJul 2025\n-\nJun 2026\n \n2024\n(in millions)\nNotional Amount\nMaturity Date\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n401\n \nJul 2024\n-\nJun 2025\nThe following table summarizes the pre-tax gain/(loss) included in OCI for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n11\n \n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n(\n2\n)\n \n74\nCardinal Health \n| \nFiscal 2025 Form 10-K\nNotes to Financial Statements\nThe following table summarizes the pre-tax gain/(loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nForeign currency contracts (1)\n$\n3\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n9\n \nForeign currency contracts (2)\n(\n6\n)\n4\n \n2\n \nForeign currency contracts (3)\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n1\n \nForward interest rate swaps (4)\n2\n \n2\n \n2\n \n(1)    Included in revenue in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n(2)    Included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n(3)    Included in \nSG&A expenses\n in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n(4)    Included in \ninterest expense, net\n in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we enter into cross-currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments.\nIn February 2025, we entered into €\n100\n million ($\n105\n million) cross-currency swaps maturing in February 2027.\nIn February 2025, we terminated the €\n100\n million ($\n107\n million) cross-currency swaps entered into in March 2023 and received net settlement in cash of $\n2\n million, recorded in proceeds from net investment hedge terminations in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn June 2024, we terminated the ¥\n18\n billion ($\n120\n million) cross-currency swaps with a maturity date of June 2027 entered into in September 2023, and received net settlements in cash of $\n6\n million, which was recorded in proceeds from net investment hedge terminations in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn September 2023, we entered into ¥\n18\n billion ($\n120\n million) cross-currency swaps maturing in September 2025 and ¥\n18\n billion ($\n120\n million) cross-currency swaps maturing in June 2027.\nIn September 2023, we terminated the ¥\n38\n billion ($\n300\n million) cross-currency swaps entered into in January 2023 and received net settlement in cash of $\n28\n million, recorded in proceeds from net investment hedge terminations in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn January 2023, we entered into ¥\n19\n billion ($\n150\n million) cross-currency swaps maturing in September 2025 and ¥\n19\n billion ($\n150\n million) cross-currency swaps maturing in June 2027. In March 2023, we entered into €\n100\n million ($\n107\n million) cross-currency swaps maturing in March 2025, €\n100\n million ($\n107\n million) cross-currency swaps maturing in March 2026.\nIn January and March 2023, we terminated the ¥\n48\n billion ($\n400\n million) cross-currency swaps entered into in March 2022 and the €\n200\n million ($\n233\n million) cross-currency swap entered into in September 2018, respectively, and received net settlements in cash of $\n10\n million and $\n19\n million, respectively. These were recorded in proceeds from net investment hedge terminations in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nCross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are marked-to-market using the current spot exchange rate as of the \nend of the period, with gains and losses included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investments. To the extent the cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are not highly effective, changes in carrying value attributable to the change in spot rates are recorded in earnings. \nPre-tax gains and losses from net investment hedges recorded in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss were a $\n33\n million loss and a $\n26\n million gain during fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Gains recognized in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings for the portion of the net investment hedges excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were $\n9\n million and\n \n$\n14\n million during fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nEconomic (Non-Designated) Hedges\nWe enter into foreign currency contracts to manage our foreign exchange exposure related to sales transactions, intercompany financing transactions, and other balance sheet items subject to revaluation that do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, these derivative instruments are adjusted to current market value at the end of each period through earnings. The gain or loss recorded on these instruments is substantially offset by the remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or liability. The settlement of the derivative instrument and the remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or liability are both recorded in other (income)/expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The principal currencies managed through foreign currency contracts are the Canadian dollar, euro, Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, and Brazilian real.\nThe following tables summarize the outstanding economic (non-designated) derivative instruments at June 30:\n \n2025\n(in millions)\nNotional Amount\nMaturity Date\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n194\n \nJul 2025\n \n2024\n(in millions)\nNotional Amount\nMaturity Date\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n178\n \nJul 2024\nThe following table summarizes the gain/(loss) recognized in earnings for economic (non-designated) derivative instruments:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n(\n6\n)\n$\n1\n \n$\n(\n7\n)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of cash and equivalents, trade receivables, net, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities at June 30, 2025 and 2024 approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.\nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n75\nNotes to Financial Statements\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our long-term obligations and other short-term borrowings compared to the respective carrying amounts at June 30:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nEstimated fair value\n$\n8,388\n \n$\n4,891\n \nCarrying amount\n8,527\n \n5,092\n \nThe fair value of our long-term obligations and other short-term borrowings is estimated based on either the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or other inputs derived from available market information, which represents a Level 2 measurement.\nThe following table is a summary of the fair value gain/(loss) of our derivative instruments based upon the estimated amount that we would receive (or pay), considering counter-party credit risk, to terminate the contracts at June 30:\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nNotional\nAmount\nFair Value\nGain/(Loss)\nNotional\nAmount\nFair Value\nGain/(Loss)\nPay-floating interest rate swaps\n$\n1,600\n \n$\n(\n29\n)\n$\n1,600\n \n$\n(\n91\n)\nForeign currency contracts\n575\n \n5\n \n579\n \n(\n7\n)\nCross-currency swap\n332\n \n(\n24\n)\n334\n \n11\n \n12. Shareholders' Deficit \nAt June 30, 2025 and 2024, authorized capital shares consisted of the following: \n750\n million Class A common shares, without par value; \n5\n million Class B common shares, without par value; and \n500\n thousand non-voting preferred shares, without par value. The Class A common shares and Class B common shares are collectively referred to below as “common shares.” Holders of common shares are entitled to share equally in any dividends declared by the Board of Directors and to participate equally in all distributions of assets upon liquidation. Generally, the holders of Class A common shares are entitled to \none\n vote per share, and the holders of Class B common shares are entitled to one-fifth of one vote per share on proposals presented to shareholders for vote.

Segment Information \nWe operate under \ntwo\n reportable segments: Pharma and GMPD. All remaining operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosures are included in Other, which is comprised of Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, at-Home Solutions, and OptiFreight\n®\n. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates performance for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance combined with the nature of the individual business activities.\nOur Pharma segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and over-the-counter healthcare and consumer products in the United States. This segment also provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers for specialty pharmaceutical products; provides pharmacy management services to hospitals and operates a limited number of pharmacies, including pharmacies in community health centers; repackages generic pharmaceuticals and over the counter healthcare products; and includes our managed services organization platforms for physician offices.\nOur GMPD segment manufactures, sources, and distributes Cardinal Health brand medical, surgical, and laboratory products, which are sold in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and other markets. This segment also distributes a broad range of medical, surgical, and laboratory products known as national brand products to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories, and other healthcare providers in the United States and Canada.\nThe remaining \nthree\n non-reportable operating segments included in Other are Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, at-Home Solutions, and OptiFreight\n®\n Logistics. These operating segments respectively operate nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, distribute medical products to patients' homes in the United States, and provide supply chain services and solutions to our customers.\nRevenue\nThe following table presents revenue for the two reportable segments and disaggregated revenue within the remaining operating segments, included in Other, and Corporate: \n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nPharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions\n$\n204,644\n \n$\n210,019\n \n$\n188,814\n \nGlobal Medical Products and Distribution\n12,636\n \n12,381\n \n12,222\n \nNuclear and Precision Health Solutions\n1,578\n \n1,369\n \n1,197\n \nat-Home Solutions\n3,480\n \n2,869\n \n2,584\n \nOptiFreight\n®\n Logistics\n324\n \n274\n \n240\n \nOther\n5,382\n \n4,512\n \n4,021\n \nTotal segment revenue\n222,662\n \n226,912\n \n205,057\n \nCorporate (1)\n(\n84\n)\n(\n85\n)\n(\n78\n)\nTotal revenue\n$\n222,578\n \n$\n226,827\n \n$\n204,979\n \n(1)\nCorporate revenue consists of the elimination of inter-segment revenue and other revenue not allocated to the segments.\nThe following table presents revenue by geographic area:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nUnited States\n$\n220,993\n \n$\n225,231\n \n$\n203,440\n \nInternational\n1,669\n \n1,681\n \n1,617\n \nTotal segment revenue\n222,662\n \n226,912\n \n205,057\n \nCorporate (1)\n(\n84\n)\n(\n85\n)\n(\n78\n)\nTotal revenue\n$\n222,578\n \n$\n226,827\n \n$\n204,979\n \n(1)\nCorporate revenue consists of the elimination of inter-segment revenue and other revenue not allocated to the segments.\nSegment Profit\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), evaluates segment performance based on segment profit, among other measures. Segment profit is segment revenue less segment cost of products sold, less segment distribution, selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses. Segment SG&A expenses include share-based compensation expense as well as allocated corporate technology and shared functions expenses, including corporate management, corporate finance, financial and customer care shared services, human resources, information technology, and legal and compliance, including certain litigation defense costs. Corporate expenses are allocated to the operating segments based on headcount, level of benefit provided and other ratable allocation methodologies. The results attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded within segment profit.\nCardinal Health \n|\n Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K\n77\nNotes to Financial Statements\nWe do not allocate the following items to our segments: \n•\nlast-in first-out, or (\"LIFO\"), inventory charges/(credits);\n•\nstate opioid assessment related to prior fiscal years;\n•\nshareholder cooperation agreement costs;\n•\nrestructuring and employee severance;\n•\namortization and other acquisition-related costs;\n•\nacquisition-related cash and share-based compensation costs;\n•\nimpairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net; \n•\nlitigation (recoveries)/charges, net;\n•\nother (income)/expense, net;\n•\ninterest expense, net;\n•\nloss on early extinguishment of debt; or\n•\nprovision for/(benefit from) income taxes \nIn addition, certain investment spending, certain portions of enterprise-wide incentive compensation, and other spending are not allocated to the segments. Investment spending generally includes the first-year spend for certain projects that require incremental investments in the form of additional operating expenses. Because approval for these projects is dependent on executive management, we retain these expenses at Corporate.

Share-Based Compensation \nWe maintain Cardinal Health, Inc. stock incentive plans (collectively, the “Plans”) for the benefit of certain of our officers, directors, and employees. Upon vesting these units convert to common shares without restrictions or future service requirements. At June 30, 2025, \n15\n million shares remain available for future grants under the Cardinal Health, Inc. 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"2021 LTIP\"). Under the 2021 LTIP's fungible share counting provisions, stock options are counted against the plan as one share for every share issued; awards other than stock options are counted against the plan as two and one-half shares for every share issued. This means that only \n6\n million shares could be issued under awards other than stock options while \n15\n million shares could be issued under stock options. Shares are issued out of treasury shares when stock options are exercised and when restricted share units and performance share units vest. Until the end of fiscal 2018, stock options were granted to our officers and certain employees. There were \nno\n stock options granted to employees during fiscal 2025, 2024, or 2023.\nDuring fiscal 2024, we modified the equity incentive awards of \nfour\n employees to amend provisions over involuntary termination. We recognized incremental share-based compensation expense of $\n9\n million.\nThe following table provides total share-based compensation expense by type of award:\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nRestricted share unit expense\n$\n71\n \n$\n77\n \n$\n64\n \nPerformance share unit expense\n50\n \n44\n \n32\n \nTotal share-based compensation expense\n$\n121\n \n$\n121\n \n$\n96\n \nThe total tax benefit related to share-based compensation was $\n14\n million, $\n16\n million, and $\n12\n million for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Our consolidated statements of cash flows present our share-based compensation expense as a reconciling adjustment between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for all periods presented.\nRestricted Share Units\nRestricted share units granted under the Plans generally vest in equal annual installments over \nthree years\n.
