  "item1_summary": " The regulatory environment to which we are subject is discussed in \"Item 1 - Business\" beginning on page  revenue and business strategy . A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts .\n Volume has the most significant impact on clearing and transaction fees revenue . Rate structure, product mix and revenue also influence this source of revenue . The percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers . Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products .\n BrokerTec Americas provides matching services to allow both parties to complete the trade bilaterally or through a third-party clearing house . Revenue is generated from this business generally on a transaction fee basis . Revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases . Revenue also derived from other sources, including market data and information services .\n Our service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotations, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources . Users of our basic service receive real time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data . Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products .\n The majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in contract volume . Licensing and other fee agreements can vary with certain equity, energy and swap volumes . Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense . Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes .\n Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment . Technology expense consists of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. Technology expense also includes costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and some market data customers .\n Licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of contract volume in equity index products . Marketing, advertising and public relations expense includes media, print and other advertising costs . Other expenses include litigation and customer settlements, impairment charges on operating assets, gains and losses on disposals of certain operating assets .\n Investment income is influenced by market interest rates, changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms, the amount of dividends distributed by our strategic investments . Losses include income and losses from our investments in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, OSTTRA, Shanghai CFETS-NEX International Money Broking Co., Ltd. and Gulf Mercantile Exchange .\n There are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical . These policies relate to the valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and internal use software costs . Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants .\n Goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value . Under certain favorable circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions .\n Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances . Under certain favorable circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value . The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the carrying value of the amortizing asset to its undiscounted net cash flows .\n A portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house . We also earn revenue from the dissemination of market data to subscribers, distributors, and other third-party licensees . Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of income taxes that will be paid for the current year .\n If the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made . The effective tax rate will vary from year to year based on changes in tax rates and regulations . Software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred .\n The following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented . For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2022, see \"Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024 .\n Contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures below exclude trading volume for cash markets business as well as interest rate swaps . We estimate the following net increase in clearing and transaction fees based on a change in total contract volume during 2024 compared with 2023 . Average daily contract volume can be influenced by many factors, including political and economic factors, the regulatory environment and market competition .\n Market volatility within certain financial markets remained high throughout 2024 . Interest rate volatility was higher as a result of mixed inflation levels and market uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions . We believe these factors contributed to the increase in total volume in 2024 compared with 2023 . We also expanded our ongoing sales efforts across many of the product lines to increase sales growth across the globe .\n In 2024 compared with 2023, overall interest rate contract volume increased as a result of general market uncertainty . The Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in 2024 and issued cautious guidance for 2025 . The increase in Nasdaq-100 contract volume was partially offset by lower overall equity volatility within the S&P 500 .\n The Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in 2024, but issued cautious guidance moving forward as a result of continued uncertainty surrounding inflation . We believe this is due to uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve and other global central banks' interest rate policy decisions . The following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products .\n The following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products . The average rate per contract was impacted by an increase in our fee structure, which went into effect on February 1, 2024 . The overall increase due to the rise in fees was offset by a decrease resulting from higher member trading as a percentage of total volume .\n The revenue primarily includes transaction fees from BrokerTecs's fixed income volume and EBS foreign exchange volume . ue in 2024 included $276.7 million of transaction fees attributable to the cash markets business, compared with $284.7m in  2023 . The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers .\n Approximately 30% of market data and information services revenue in 2024 was earned from the two largest resellers of our market data . The increase in other revenue was largely attributable to higher custody fees as well as an increase in co-location and other connectivity fees . Operating expenses increased by $55.4 million in 2024 when compared with 2023 .\n Operating expenses increased in 2024 when compared with 2023 due to the following reasons . The increase in expenses related to technology support services was primarily driven by higher software license fees and third party services to support the ongoing Google Cloud transformation project . The decrease in professional fees and outside services were largely due to a decrease in consulting costs associated with the Google Cloud Migration, which began in 2021 .\n In 2024 when compared with 2023, there was a decrease in earnings from reinvested cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions due to lower average reinvestment balances . The overall effective tax rate remained relatively consistent in 2024 . We have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. However, we have used our commercial paper program from time to time to fund large short-term funding needs .\n Our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels . Cash will also be required for non-cancellable purchase obligations as at December 31, 2024 . In 2025, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $90.0 million . Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth .\n The board of directors approved a share repurchase program, which authorizes us to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of CME Group Class A common stock at prevailing market prices . As of December 31, 2024, there have been no shares repurchased under this program . On February 6, 2025, the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.25 per shreare for all outstanding shares .\n The following is a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities . The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2024 compared with 2023 was due to lower overall proceeds on sales of investments . Cash provided by financing activities was higher in 2024 when compared with 2023 . The following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2024 .\n We maintain a $2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions, which matures in November 2026 . Proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at CME Group's discretion . We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, but any commercial paper balance if or when outstanding can be backed up against this facility .\n The facility provides for borrowings of up to $7.0 billion . We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event a clearing firm fails to promptly discharge an obligation to the clearing house, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary . At December 31, 2024, guaranty fund contributions available to collateralize the facility totaled $10.1 billion .\n CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own . Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide the funds that it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders . At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities .\n Given our cash flow generation, our ability to pay down debt levels, if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating .

The firm is exposed to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates, credit and foreign currency exchange rates . CME Clearing House acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchange as well as through third party exchanges and swaps markets .\n In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms . We set minimum performance bond requirements for exchange-traded and interest rate swaps products . We mark-to-market open positions of clearing firms at least once a day (twice a day for futures and options contracts) and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value .\n We cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default . We maintain a $7.0 billion 364-day multi-currency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house .\n We also have the option to use our $2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default . Pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities .
