  "item1_summary": " The Company operates approximately 590 locations in 43 states across the U.S. We offer an integrated solution to our customers by providing manufacturing, supply, and installation of a full range of structural and related building products . Our manufacturing products include our factory-built roof and floor trusses, wall panels, vinyl windows, custom millwork and trim .\n Manufactured products consist of wood floor and roof trusses, wall panels, engineered wood and our Ready-Frame®® framing system . Specialty building products and services consist of vinyl, composite and wood siding, exterior trim, metal studs, cement, roofing, insulation, wallboard, ceilings, cabinets, and hardware .\n Our business is driven primarily by the residential new construction market and the residential repair and remodel market . We believe the housing industry remains underbuilt and that there are several meaningful trends that indicate U.S. housing demand will continue to be strong over the long-term . The homebuilding industry continues to undergo consolidation, and the larger homebuilders continue to increase their market share .\n Our primary focus has been on single-family residential new construction and the repair and remodel end market . We continue to focus on expanding our custom homebuilder base while maintaining acceptable credit standards . We expect that our ability to remain competitive in this space will depend on our continued ability to provide a high level of customer service coupled with a broad product offering .\n The building products supply industry is highly dependent upon new home construction and, to a lesser extent, repair and remodel activities . Shortening cycle times from start to completion is a key imperative of the homebuilders during periods of strong consumer demand . The availability of skilled construction labor remains limited, we continue to see the demand for prefabricated components increasing within the residential new construction market .\n Homebuyer demand may shift toward smaller or larger homes creating fluctuations in demand for our products . Short-term changes in the cost and/or availability of these materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are often passed on to our customers, but our pricing quotation periods and market competition may limit our ability to pass on such price changes . We may also experience challenges sourcing suitable products for our customers .\n During 2024, we completed a number of acquisitions for a combined $345.4 million purchase price, net of cash acquired, including the acquisitions of Quality Door & Millwork, Inc. (“Quality Door”), (ii) Hanson Truss Components, (ii), (iii) RPM Wood Products, Inc., (iv) Schoeneman Bros.

Cluss Lumber, a lumber and building supplies provider in southwestern Pennsylvania, western Maryland and northern West Virginia .

The net proceeds from the offering were used to pay related transaction costs .\n Peter Jackson appointed as the Company’s next President & Chief Executive Officer and member of its board of directors, effective November 6, 2024 . Pete Beckmann, Senior Vice President, as Chief Financial Officer to succeed Mr. Jackson . The transaction is described further in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K .\n U.S. total housing starts for the year ended December 31, 2024, were 1.4 million, a decrease of 3.9% compared to the year end of 2023 . Housing industry remains underbuilt due to growth in the underlying demographics compared to historical new construction levels . We believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of construction activity in our markets and to increase our market share, which may include strategic acquisitions .\n A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024 . The following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain costs, expenses and income items .\n The table shows net sales classified by major product category for the years ended December 31 . Manufactured products and windows, doors and millwork are collectively referred to as total value-added products . We experienced decreased net sales in our manufactured products categories primarily due to a continued normalization in multi-family and commodity deflation .\n Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $48.2 million, or 1.3% . Interest expense, net was $207.7 million in 2024, an increase of $15.6 million from 2023 . Income tax expense was a decrease of $134.0 million, driven by a decrease in income before income taxes in the current period .\n Borrowing base consists of trade accounts receivable, inventory, other receivables, and qualified cash that all meet specific criteria contained within the credit agreement, minus agent specified reserves . Net excess borrowing availability is equal to the maximum borrowing amount minus outstanding borrowings and letters of credit . In addition, we may use the Revolving Facility to assist debt consolidation .\n As of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Facility and our net excess borrowing availability was $1.6 billion after being reduced by outstanding letters of credit of $0.1 billion . Excess availability must equal or exceed a minimum specified amount, currently $171.4 million .\n The Company used $42.4 million more cash to invest compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to $97.8 million more spent on acquisitions, offset by $63.0 million less as a net investment in property, plant and equipment . There are no assurances that these steps would prove successful or materially improve our liquidity position .\n Critical accounting policies are those that both are important to the accurate portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results, and require subjective or complex judgments . Capital expenditures have, for the most part, remained at relatively low levels in comparison to the operating cash flows generated during the corresponding periods . We expect our 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $350 million to $450 million .\n At December 31, 2024, our goodwill balance was $3.7 billion, representing 34.8% of our total assets . We test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or at any other time when impairment indicators exist . Housing starts are a significant sales driver for us. If there is a significant decline or an expected decline in housing starts, this could adversely affect our expectations for a reporting unit .\n We assessed our goodwill balance at December 31, 2024, using a quantitative assessment . We developed the fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology . Expected future profitability reflects current headcount levels and cost structure and are flexed in future years based upon historical trends at various revenue levels . Long-term growth was based on terminal value EBITDA multiples .\n At December 31, 2024, the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts . We did not have any goodwill impairments in 2024, 2023 or 2022 . Future impairment of goodwill would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period but would not impact our current outstanding debt obligations .\n Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest at either a base rate or secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), plus, in each case, an applicable margin . We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the . Revolving . Facility as of December 31, 2024 . We purchase certain materials, including lumber products, which are then sold to customers . Delays in our ability to pass on material price increases to our customers can adversely impact our operating results .\n The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Builders FirstSource, Inc.  Registered Public Accounting Firm reviewed the financial statements of operations, of changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes .

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud .\n A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company . Because of its inherent limitations, internal control may not prevent or detect misstatements .\n The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements . The Company recognized consolidated net sales of $16.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, a majority of which pertains to distribution sales . Distribution sales typically consist of the sale of building products the Company manufactures and the resale of purchased building products .\n PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. ermination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for distribution sales is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s distribution sales.

Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows .\n In evaluating goodwill for impairment at December 31, 2024, we developed the fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology . The discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership . Actual results could differ from such estimates resulting in further impairment of goodwill .\n The fair value of acquired customer relationships intangible assets was primarily estimated by applying the multiperiod excess earnings method, which involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily related to forecasted revenue growth rates, gross margin, contributory asset charges, customer attrition rates, and market-participant discount rates .
