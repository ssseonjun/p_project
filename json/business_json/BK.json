Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries are:\n•\nThe Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state-chartered bank, which houses our Securities Services businesses, including Asset Servicing and Issuer Services and certain Market and Wealth Services businesses, including Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, as well as the bank-advised business of Investment Management; and\n•\nBNY Mellon, National Association (“BNY Mellon, N.A.”), a national bank, which houses \nour Wealth Management business and certain activities of our Pershing businesses.  \nWe have four other U.S. bank and/or trust company subsidiaries concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois.

Our core objective is to empower our teams to do their best work, make unique contributions and build purposeful careers in an environment where they are treated with fairness, dignity and respect.\nBelonging\nBelonging is integral to who we are as a company, what our people experience as members of our global team, and how we serve all of our stakeholders.  Our strategy is not separate, it includes all of our employees and is embedded in the way we do business, our operating model, talent experience and client value proposition. \nAt the end of 2024, women represented 40% of BNY’s global workforce and 43% of BNY’s U.S. workforce.\n \nFurther, 39% of BNY’s U.S. workforce were from U.S. underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.\nAt the end of 2024, 43% of BNY’s Executive Committee were women and 26% of BNY’s Executive Committee were from underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.\n \nAt the end of 2024, 45% of our Board of Directors were women and 27% of our Board of Directors was composed of individuals from underrepresented ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.  \nRetention, Training and Development\nWe seek to attract and retain employees by providing a rewarding employee experience.  We recognize that employees seek a supportive and safe workplace, and we continually evaluate our employee engagement and wellbeing programs in an effort to meet those expectations. \n \nWe offer a 401(k) plan for U.S. employees and other defined contribution retirement plans worldwide, where consistent with market practice. \n We also maintain defined benefit plans for certain current and former employees, some of which are frozen (including in the U.S.).  \nAt Dec. 31, 2024, we had approximately 41,500 participants in our 401(k) plan, including former employees.\n \nIn addition, our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan \ncovered approximately 6,400 U.S. participants, and our non-U.S. defined benefit plans (some frozen) covered approximately 18,400 non-U.S. participants. \nIn 2024, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation again provided eligible employees an award of 10 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or “BK Shares”.  BK Shares is an equity grant that allows for eligible employees to become equity owners, or increase their equity holdings in the Company, and share in the Company’s success.  \nAt key career transition points, from internship to executive management, we offer programs and development opportunities to help employees advance their careers and progress within our organization.  Our extensive training and development opportunities are designed to enable employees to grow professionally and advance within our organization. \nWe engage with employees to encourage innovation, show appreciation for their contributions, and gather feedback on how we can build a more rewarding, inclusive workplace.  For example, we regularly gather feedback through an all-employee survey. \nEmployee Wellbeing, Health and Safety\nBNY’s holistic approach to employee wellbeing is designed to create a healthy, resilient and vibrant workforce.  Our programs are designed to provide employees access to resources to help improve their physical health, emotional resilience, financial wellbeing and social connections.  Further, we work to ensure the safety of our employees and clients in all of our facilities.  \nBNY fosters a high-performance culture and supports employee work/life balance, while also delivering on our regulatory requirements and business imperatives.  We endeavor to promote a collaborative and effective workplace for our people, while continuing to embrace the concept of flexibility and enhancing our culture and commercial impact.\nEmployees and International Operations\nGlobally, at Dec. 31, 2024, BNY and its subsidiaries had approximately 51,800 full-time employees.\n \nWe pride ourselves on providing dedicated service through our multilingual sales, marketing and client \n6  BNY\nservice teams.  At \nDec. 31, 2024\n, approximately 60% of our total employees (full-time and part-time employees) were based outside the U.S., with approximately 10,900 employees in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), approximately 18,900 employees in the Asia-Pacific region (“APAC”) and approximately 800 employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil.\nSupervision and Regulation\nInformation on the supervision and regulation of BNY can be found in the “MD&A – Supervision and Regulation” section in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nCompetition\nBNY is subject to competition in all aspects and areas of our business.  Our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services businesses compete with domestic and international financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust services, clearing services, collateral management services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and integrated cash management solutions and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms.  Our Investment and Wealth Management business competes with domestic and international investment management and wealth management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers.  \nCompetition in the financial services industry continues to be intense.  Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, transaction execution, capital or access to capital, quality and range of products and services offered, performance, technological innovation and expertise, including adaptation to technological change, price, reputation and lending limits.  Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served.  Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees, retain, develop and motivate our existing employees, amid heightened regulatory restrictions and an inflationary or uncertain \ninterest rate environment.  Our competitive position may be affected by institutions that are not similarly subject to extensive regulation, such as financial technology firms, and as further technological advances enable more companies, such as financial technology firms, to provide financial services. \nFor additional discussion regarding competition, see “MD&A – Risk Factors – Operational Risk – Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain, develop and motivate employees” and “MD&A – Risk Factors – Strategic Risk – We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability” in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.",
