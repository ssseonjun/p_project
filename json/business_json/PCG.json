    "item1": "Item 1. Business, under “Electric Utility Operations”, “Natural Gas Utility Operations,” and “Nuclear Operations.”  The Utility occupies or uses real property primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental authorities.  In total, the Utility occupies approximately 7.5 million square feet of real property, including 5.5 million square feet owned by the Utility.  Virtually all of the Utility’s plant property is subject to the lien of a first mortgage bond indenture.\nThe Utility leases the Lakeside Building and has exercised an option to purchase the Property.  The Utility will continue to lease the Property until closing in June 2025.  For more information, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nThe Utility owns over 135,000 acres of land, including approximately 100,000 acres of watershed lands.  In 2002, the Utility agreed to implement its Land Conservation Commitment (“LCC”) to permanently preserve the six “beneficial public values” on all the watershed lands through conservation easements or equivalent protections, as well as to make approximately 40,000 acres of the watershed lands available for donation to qualified organizations.  The six “beneficial public values” being preserved by the LCC include: natural habitat of fish, wildlife, and plants; open space; outdoor recreation by the general public; sustainable forestry; agricultural uses; and historic values.  In 2024, the Utility met its goal to permanently preserve the approximate 140,000 acres of watershed lands, after securing all required regulatory approvals.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn addition to the following proceedings, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business.  For more information regarding material lawsuits and proceedings, see “Litigation Matters” in Item 7. MD&A,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 and “Environmental Remediation Contingencies” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nRISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES\nPG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownership of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and counterparty credit.  The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourage unauthorized risk-taking, reduce commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non-trading purposes (i.e., risk mitigation) and not for speculative purposes.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas and nuclear fuel necessary for electricity generation and natural gas procurement for core customers.  The Utility’s risk management activities include the use of physical and financial instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements.  As long as the Utility can conclude that it is probable that its reasonably incurred wholesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices do not affect earnings.  Such fluctuations, however, may impact cash flows.  The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customers are also fully recoverable through a ratemaking mechanism.\nThe Utility does not have a balancing account for costs in excess of its revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers.  The Utility recovers these costs in its GRC through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts, resulting in price and volumetric risk.  PG&E Corporation uses value-at-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks.  The value-at-risk was approximately \n$5 million \nand $4 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of price risk management activities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, if interest rates changed by one percent for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and cash investments, the pre-tax impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $6 million and $57 million, respectively, based on net variable rate debt and other interest rate-sensitive instruments outstanding.  See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of interest rates.\n82\nEnergy Procurement Credit Risk\nThe Utility conducts business with counterparties mainly in the energy industry to purchase electricity or gas and related services, including the CAISO market, other California IOUs, municipal utilities, energy trading companies, pipelines, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gas production companies located in the United States and Canada.  If a counterparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas and related services, then the Utility may find it necessary to procure electricity or gas at current market prices or seek alternate services, which may be higher than the contract prices.\nThe Utility manages credit risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, credit ratings, and other credit criteria as deemed appropriate.  Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically.  The Utility executes many energy contracts under master commodity enabling agreements that may require security.  Security may be in the form of cash or letters of credit.  The Utility may accept other forms of performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or other eligible securities (as deemed appropriate by the Utility).  Security or performance assurance may be required from the Utility or counterparties when current net receivables or payables and exposure exceed contractually specified limits.\nThe following table summarizes the Utility’s energy procurement credit risk exposure to its counterparties:\nExposure\n (1) \n(in millions)\nNumber of\nWholesale\nCustomers or\nCounterparties\n>10%\nNet Credit\nExposure to\nWholesale\nCustomers or\nCounterparties\n>10% \n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\n$\n1,114 \n4 \n$\n708 \nDecember 31, 2023\n$\n926 \n3 \n$\n457 \n(1) \nExposure is the positive exposure maximum that equals mark-to-market value on physically and financially settled contracts, plus net receivables (payables) where netting is contractually allowed minus collateral posted by counterparties and held by the Utility plus collateral posted by the Utility and held by the counterparties.  For purposes of this table, parental guarantees are not included as part of the calculation.  Exposure amounts reported above do not include adjustments for time value or liquidity.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The accounting policies described below are considered to be critical accounting estimates due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant and material to the financial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgments and estimates.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.  These accounting estimates and their key characteristics are outlined below.\nContributions to the Wildfire Fund\nThe Wildfire Fund is expected to be capitalized with at least $21 billion through (i) a 15-year non-bypassable charge to customers, (ii) $7.5 billion in initial contributions from California’s three large electric IOUs, and (iii) $300 million in annual contributions paid by California’s three large electric IOUs for a 10-year period.  The contributions from the IOUs will be effectively borne by their respective shareholders, as they will not be permitted to recover these costs through rates.  The costs of the initial and annual contributions are allocated among the IOUs pursuant to a “Wildfire Fund allocation metric” set forth in AB 1054 based on land area in the applicable IOU’s service area classified as HFTDs and adjusted to account for risk mitigation efforts.  The Utility’s Wildfire Fund allocation metric is 64.2% (representing an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and annual contributions of approximately $193 million).\n83\nOn the Emergence Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility contributed, in accordance with AB 1054, an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and first annual contribution of approximately $193 million to the Wildfire Fund to secure participation of the Utility therein.  The other large electric IOUs made their initial contributions to the Wildfire Fund in September 2019.  In December 2023 and 2024, the Utility made its fifth and sixth annual contributions of $193 million each to the Wildfire Fund.  As of December 31, 2024, the Utility has four remaining annual contributions of $193 million (based on the Wildfire Fund allocation metric).  PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for contributions to the Wildfire Fund by capitalizing an asset, amortizing to periods ratably based on an estimated period of coverage, and incrementally adjusting for accelerated amortization as the level of coverage declines, as further described below.\nAs of December 31, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $193 million in Other current liabilities, $564 million in Other noncurrent liabilities, $301 million in Current assets - Wildfire Fund asset, and $4.1 billion in Noncurrent assets - Wildfire Fund asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Utility recorded amortization and accretion expense of $383 million and $567 million, respectively.  The amortization of the asset, accretion of the liability, and acceleration of the amortization of the asset is reflected in Wildfire Fund expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Expected contributions recorded in Wildfire Fund asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are discounted to the present value using the 10-year U.S. treasury rate at the date PG&E Corporation and the Utility satisfied all the eligibility requirements to participate in the Wildfire Fund.  A useful life of 20 years is being used to amortize the Wildfire Fund asset.\nAB 1054 did not specify a period of coverage; therefore, this accounting treatment is subject to significant accounting judgments and estimates.  In estimating the period of coverage, PG&E Corporation and the Utility use a Monte Carlo simulation that began with 12 years of historical, publicly available fire-loss data from wildfires caused by electrical equipment, and subsequently plan to add an additional year of data each following year.  The period of historic fire-loss data and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts by the California electric utility companies are significant assumptions used to estimate the useful life.  These assumptions along with the other assumptions below create a high degree of uncertainty related to the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund.  The simulation creates annual distributions of potential losses due to fires that could be attributed to the participating electric utilities.  Initial use of five years of historical data, with average annual statewide claims or settlements of approximately $6.5 billion versus 12 years of historical data, with average annual statewide claims or settlements of approximately $2.9 billion, would have resulted in a six year amortization period.  As of December 31, 2024, a 5% change to the assumption around current and future mitigation effort effectiveness would increase the amortization period by five years assuming greater effectiveness and would decrease the amortization period by five years assuming less effectiveness.\nOther assumptions used to estimate the useful life include the disclosed cost of wildfires caused by participating electric utilities, the amount at which wildfire claims would be settled, the likely adjudication of the CPUC in cases of electric utility-caused wildfires and determination of any amounts required to be reimbursed to the Wildfire Fund, the impacts of climate change, the level of future insurance coverage held by the electric utilities, the FERC-allocable portion of loss recovery, and the future transmission and distribution equity rate base growth of participating electric utilities.  Significant changes in any of these estimates could materially impact the amortization period.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility re-evaluate the estimated period of coverage annually and when additional information becomes available, and the expected life of the Wildfire Fund will be adjusted as required.  The Wildfire Fund is available to other participating utilities in California and the amount of claims that a participating utility incurs is not limited to its individual contribution amount.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess the Wildfire Fund asset for acceleration of the amortization of the asset in the event that a participating utility’s electrical equipment is found to be the substantial cause of a catastrophic wildfire.  Timing of any such acceleration of the amortization of the asset could lag as the emergence of sufficient cause and claims information can take many quarters and could be limited to public disclosure of the participating electric utility, if ignition were to occur outside the Utility’s service area.  There were fires in the Utility’s and other participating utilities’ service areas since July 12, 2019, including fires for which the cause is unknown, which may in the future be determined to be covered by the Wildfire Fund.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $72 million and $102 million of accelerated amortization, reflected in Wildfire Fund expense for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $600 million and $156 million in Accounts receivable - other and Other noncurrent assets, respectively, for Wildfire Fund receivables related to the 2021 Dixie fire.\nFor more information, see “Contributions to the Wildfire Fund Established Pursuant to AB 1054” in Note 2 and “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\n84\nLoss Contingencies\nAs discussed below, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded material accruals for various wildfire-related, enforcement and legal matters, and environmental remediation liabilities.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded insurance receivables for third-party claims.\nWildfire-Related Liabilities\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to potential liabilities related to wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a wildfire-related liability when they determine that a loss is probable, and they can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses.  The provision is based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.\nThe process for estimating wildfire-related liabilities requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors, including the factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires.  See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nEnforcement and Litigation Matters\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims and lawsuits.  In addition, penalties may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a provision for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly, and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated outside counsel costs, which are expensed as incurred.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.  See Note 14 and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nLoss Recoveries\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility have recovery mechanisms available for wildfire liabilities including from insurance, through rates, and from the Wildfire Fund.  The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party claims arising before August 1, 2023.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a receivable for a recovery when they determine that it is probable that they will recover a recorded loss, and they can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.  The assessment of whether recovery is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss recoveries are reviewed quarterly, and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, including contractual liability insurance policy coverage, advice of legal counsel, past experience with similar events, communications with the Wildfire Fund administrators, the CPUC and FERC, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  See “Loss Recoveries” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nEnvironmental Remediation Liabilities\nThe Utility is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the Utility to pay for environmental remediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party.  Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardous substances at various potential sites, including former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site.\n85\nThe Utility generally commences the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potential site requiring remedial action.  (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in cooperation with regulatory agencies.  For example, the Utility has a program related to certain former MGP sites.)  Based on such notification, the Utility completes an assessment of the potential site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred.  The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible losses.  Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for estimating remediation liabilities is subjective and requires significant judgment.  Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and types of hazardous substances at a potential site, the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.\nWhen possible, the Utility estimates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites depending on the level of information available.  Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to the remediation effort.  These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions, operations and maintenance activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.  Remediation efforts for a particular site generally extend over a period of several years.  During this period, the laws governing the remediation process may change, as well as site conditions, which could affect the cost of the remediation effort.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Utility’s accruals for undiscounted gross environmental liabilities were $1.3 billion each.  The Utility’s undiscounted future costs could increase to as much as $2.3 billion if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if the other potentially responsible parties are not financially able to contribute to these costs and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyond regulatory requirements.  Although the Utility has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs may vary significantly from actual costs, and the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.\nRegulatory Accounting\nAs a regulated entity, the Utility records regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers.  The Utility continues to apply ASC 980, \nRegulated Operations\n.  These amounts would otherwise be recorded to expense or income under GAAP.  Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 2 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  As of December 31, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reported regulatory assets (including current regulatory balancing accounts receivable) of $23.0 billion and regulatory liabilities (including current regulatory balancing accounts payable) of $23.8 billion.\nDetermining probability requires significant judgment by management and includes consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or court appeals.  For some of the Utility’s regulatory assets, including utility-retained generation, the Utility has determined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from the CPUC.  The Utility also records a regulatory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery of incurred costs is probable, such as the regulatory assets for pension benefits; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, on reacquired debt.  If the Utility determined that it is no longer probable that regulatory assets would be recovered or reflected in future rates, or if the Utility ceased to be subject to rate regulation, the regulatory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made.  If regulatory accounting did not apply, the Utility’s future financial results could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense or revenue recognition.\nA portion of the Utility’s regulatory asset balances relate to items which could not be anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests resulting from catastrophic events, changes in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices.  The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in a memorandum account, and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudently incurred.  These accounts, which include the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and MGMA among others, allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfire prevention-related costs.  In addition, the RUBA tracks costs associated with customer protections, including higher uncollectible costs related to a moratorium on electric and gas service disconnections for residential customers.  While the Utility generally believes such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUC authorization in separate proceedings or through a GRC.\n86\nAdditionally, SB 901 provides a mechanism for the CPUC to potentially allow recovery in future rates, through a securitization mechanism, of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the customer harm threshold (“CHT”).  SB 901 required the CPUC to establish the CHT to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate, so that they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming customers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe service.  The Utility must evaluate the likelihood of recovery in future rates each period.  In 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a regulatory asset associated with SB 901.  As of December 31, 2024, the SB 901 regulatory asset was approximately $5.2 billion.  See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nIn addition, regulatory accounting standards require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and if a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made.  Such assessments require significant judgment by management regarding probability of recovery, as described above, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets.  The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expected to exceed the amount to be recovered.  The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments regarding detailed project plans, estimates included in third-party contracts, historical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards, and a variety of other factors.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value and its settlement date can be made.  At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.  The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recovered through the ratemaking process.  See Notes 2 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nTo estimate its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs, inflation rates, and the estimated date of decommissioning.  The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the risk associated with the decommissioning obligation.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Utility’s recorded ARO for the estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was approximately $5.4 billion.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \nPG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees as well as contributory postretirement health care and medical plans for eligible retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees.  Adjustments to the pension and other benefit obligation are based on the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results.  These amounts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis.  The differences between pension benefit expense recognized in accordance with GAAP, and amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities as amounts are probable of recovery through rates.  To the extent the other benefits are in an overfunded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability.  See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nThe pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date.  The significant actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health care cost trend rate, and the expected return on plan assets.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.  While PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan changes or amendments, or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future plan expenses.  See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\n87\nIn establishing health care cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider recent cost trends and projections from industry experts.  This evaluation suggests that current rates of inflation are expected to continue in the near term.  In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and given the design of PG&E Corporation’s plans, the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2025 was 7.5%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of approximately 4.5% in 2033 and beyond.\nExpected rates of return on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations of the employee benefit plan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments were projected based on real maturity and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term inflation rate.  For the Utility’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 6.4% compares to a ten-year actual return of 5.1%.\nThe rate used to discount pension benefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 858 Aa-grade non-callable bonds at December 31, 2024.  This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flows for the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.\nThe following reflects the sensitivity of pension costs and projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions:\n(in millions)\nIncrease\n(Decrease) in\nAssumption\nIncrease in 2024\n \nPension\nCosts\nIncrease in Projected\nBenefit Obligation at\nDecember 31, 2024\nDiscount rate\n(0.50)\n%\n$\n(1)\n$\n1,093 \nRate of return on plan assets\n(0.50)\n%\n85 \n— \nRate of increase in compensation\n0.50 \n%\n30 \n250 \nThe following reflects the sensitivity of other postretirement benefit costs and accumulated benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions:\n(in millions)\nIncrease\n(Decrease) in\nAssumption\nIncrease in 2024\nOther Postretirement\nBenefit Costs\nIncrease in Accumulated\nBenefit Obligation at\nDecember 31, 2024\nHealth care cost trend rate\n0.50 \n%\n$\n6 \n$\n37 \nDiscount rate\n(0.50)\n%\n6 \n78 \nRate of return on plan assets\n(0.50)\n%\n12 \n— \nACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nITEM 7A.

is a holding company whose primary operating subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a public utility serving northern and central California.  The Utility generates revenues mainly through the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers.  The Utility is primarily regulated by the CPUC and the FERC.  In addition, the NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation, and decommissioning of the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities.\nThis is a combined annual report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of PG&E Corporation, the Utility, and other wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.  The Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Utility and its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., the companies operate in \none\n segment).\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and in accordance with the reporting requirements of Form 10-K.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions relate to the Utility’s regulatory assets and liabilities, wildfire-related liabilities, legal and regulatory contingencies, the Wildfire Fund, environmental remediation liabilities, AROs, wildfire-related receivables, and pension and other post-retirement benefit plan obligations.  Management believes that its estimates and assumptions reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate and reasonable.  A change in management’s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that would have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows during the period in which such change occurred.\nNOTE 2: \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRegulation and Regulated Operations\nThe Utility follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorized by the CPUC or the FERC based on the Utility’s cost of providing service.  The Utility’s ability to recover a significant portion of its authorized revenue requirements through rates is generally independent, or “decoupled,” from the volume of the Utility’s electricity and natural gas sales.  The Utility records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities.  The Utility capitalizes and records as regulatory assets costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered through future rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized over the future periods in which the costs are recovered.  If costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Utility records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities.  Amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers in the future are also recorded as regulatory liabilities.\nThe Utility also records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are probable of recovery or refund.  In addition, the Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between incurred costs and customer billings or authorized revenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences are probable of recovery or refund.  These differences have no impact on net income.  See “Revenue Recognition” below.\nManagement continues to believe the use of regulatory accounting is applicable and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable.  To the extent that portions of the Utility’s operations cease to be subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, or recovery is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation or other reasons, the related regulatory assets and liabilities are written off.\n103\nSegment Reporting\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis and operate as \none\n reportable segment.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer of PG&E Corporation.  \nNet income (loss) is the measure that the chief operating decision maker uses to assess performance and decide how to allocate resources and that is most consistent with GAAP principles.  Net income is reported on PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Income.  Because PG&E Corporation and the Utility are a single reportable segment, all segment financial information can be found in PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements. \nPG&E Corporation and the Utility do not have any significant segment expenses because the chief operating decision maker is not regularly provided with information that is considered to be significant under ASC 280, Segment Reporting.  Except for publicly available information, the information regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker consists of financial reports with metrics that combine year-to-date actual results with forecasts of the remainder of the year in order to provide a comprehensive view of the entire year.  These metrics do not separate expenses already incurred from forecast information.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents are stated at fair value.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Utility also held $\n272\n million and $\n294\n million of Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, respectively, that primarily consist of AB 1054 and SB 901 fixed recovery charge collections that are to be used to service the associated bonds.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Utility had contributed $\n911\n million to Pacific Energy Risk Solutions, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary and captive insurance company for the administration of wildfire liability self-insurance.  As of December 31, 2024, $\n8\n million was classified as Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents due to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and $\n905\n million, measured at fair value, was classified as Wildfire self-insurance asset.  For more information about wildfire liability self-insurance, see “Self-Insurance” in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe Utility recognizes revenues when electricity and natural gas services are delivered.  The Utility records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount of energy delivered to customers but not yet billed at the end of the period.  Unbilled revenues are included in Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Rates charged to customers are based on CPUC and FERC authorized revenue requirements.  Revenues can vary significantly from period to period because of seasonality, weather, and customer usage patterns.\nRegulatory Balancing Account Revenue\nThe CPUC authorizes most of the Utility’s revenues in the Utility’s GRCs, which occur every four years.  CPUC and FERC rates decouple authorized revenue from the volume of electricity and natural gas sales, so the Utility receives revenue equal to the amounts authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies.  As a result, the volume of electricity and natural gas sold does not have a direct impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial results.  The Utility recognizes revenues that have been authorized for rate recovery, are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and are expected to be collected within \n24\n months.  Generally, electric and natural gas operating revenue is recognized ratably over the year.  The Utility records a balancing account asset or liability for differences between customer billings and authorized revenue requirements that are probable of recovery or refund.\nThe Utility also collects additional revenue requirements to recover costs that the CPUC has authorized the Utility to pass through to customers, including costs to purchase electricity and natural gas, and to fund public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs.  In general, the revenue recognition criteria for pass-through costs billed to customers are met at the time the costs are incurred.  The Utility records a regulatory balancing account asset or liability for differences between incurred costs and customer billings or authorized revenue meant to recover those costs, to the extent that these differences are probable of recovery or refund.  As a result, these differences have no impact on net income.\n104\nThe following table presents the Utility’s revenues disaggregated by type of customer:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nElectric\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n   Residential\n$\n7,504\n \n$\n6,041\n \n$\n6,130\n \n   Commercial\n7,201\n \n5,643\n \n5,416\n \n   Industrial\n2,065\n \n1,784\n \n1,626\n \n   Agricultural\n1,815\n \n1,413\n \n1,830\n \n   Public street and highway lighting\n103\n \n83\n \n77\n \n   Other, net \n(1)\n(\n47\n)\n136\n \n(\n247\n)\n      Total revenue from contracts with customers - electric\n18,641\n \n15,100\n \n14,832\n \nRegulatory balancing accounts \n(2)\n(\n830\n)\n2,324\n \n228\n \nTotal electric operating revenue\n$\n17,811\n \n$\n17,424\n \n$\n15,060\n \nNatural gas\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n   Residential\n$\n3,089\n \n$\n3,686\n \n$\n3,353\n \n   Commercial\n984\n \n1,052\n \n1,005\n \n   Transportation service only\n1,815\n \n1,603\n \n1,534\n \n   Other, net \n(1)\n159\n \n(\n145\n)\n163\n \n      Total revenue from contracts with customers - gas\n6,047\n \n6,196\n \n6,055\n \nRegulatory balancing accounts \n(2)\n561\n \n808\n \n565\n \nTotal natural gas operating revenue\n6,608\n \n7,004\n \n6,620\n \nTotal operating revenues\n$\n24,419\n \n$\n24,428\n \n$\n21,680\n \n(1) \nThis activity is primarily related to the change in unbilled revenue and amounts subject to refund, partially offset by other miscellaneous revenue items.\n(2) \nThese amounts represent alternative revenues authorized to be billed or refunded to customers.\nFinancial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost – Credit Losses\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility use the current expected credit loss model to estimate the expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets measured at amortized cost.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate credit risk in their portfolio of financial assets quarterly.  As of December 31, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility identified the following significant categories of financial assets.\nTrade Receivables\nTrade receivables are represented by customer accounts.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record an allowance for doubtful accounts to recognize an estimate of expected lifetime credit losses.  The allowance is determined on a collective basis based on the historical amounts written-off and an assessment of customer collectability.  Furthermore, economic conditions are evaluated as part of the estimate of expected lifetime credit losses.\nExpected credit losses of $\n341\n million, $\n636\n million, and $\n143\n million were recorded in Operating and maintenance expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income for credit losses associated with trade and other receivables during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  The portion of expected credit losses that are deemed probable of recovery are deferred to the RUBA and a FERC regulatory asset account.  As of December 31, 2024, the RUBA current balancing accounts and FERC noncurrent regulatory asset balances were $\n260\n million and $\n85\n million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2023, the RUBA current balancing accounts and FERC noncurrent regulatory asset balances were $\n507\n million and $\n78\n million, respectively.  The RUBA current balancing account balance decreased from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 primarily due to a decrease in under-collections from residential customers in 2024, which are expected to be recovered in 2025.  \n105\nOther Receivables and Available-For-Sale Debt Securities\nInsurance receivables are related to the liability insurance policies PG&E Corporation and the Utility carry.  Insurance receivable risk is related to each insurance carrier’s risk of defaulting on their individual policies.  Wildfire Fund receivables are the funds available from the statewide fund established under AB 1054 for payment of eligible claims related to the 2021 Dixie fire that exceed $1.0 billion.  For more information, see Note 14 below.  Wildfire Fund receivables risk is related to the Wildfire Fund’s durability, which is a measurement of its claim-paying capacity.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are required to determine if the fair value is below the amortized cost basis for their available-for-sale debt securities (i.e., impairment).  If such an impairment exists and does not otherwise result in a write-down, then PG&E Corporation and the Utility must determine whether a portion of the impairment is a result of expected credit loss.\nAs of December 31, 2024, expected credit losses for insurance receivables, Wildfire Fund receivables, and available-for-sale debt securities were immaterial.\nEmission Allowances\nThe Utility purchases GHG emission allowances to satisfy its compliance obligations.  Associated costs are recorded as inventory and included in Current assets – Other and Other noncurrent assets – Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Costs are carried at weighted-average and are recoverable through rates.\nInventories\nInventories are carried at weighted-average cost and include gas stored underground, fuel oil, materials, and supplies.  Natural gas stored underground is recorded to inventory when injected and then expensed as the gas is withdrawn for distribution to customers or for use as fuel for electric generation.  Materials and supplies are recorded to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when consumed or installed.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment are reported at the lower of their historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value.  Historical costs include labor and materials, construction overhead, and allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”).  See “Allowance for Funds Used During Construction” below. \n \nThe Utility’s estimated service lives of its property, plant, and equipment were as follows:\n \nEstimated Service\nBalance at December 31,\n(in millions, except estimated service lives)\nLives (years)\n2024\n2023\nElectricity generating facilities \n(1)\n1\n to \n75\n$\n11,420\n \n$\n11,423\n \nElectricity distribution facilities\n10\n to \n70\n49,821\n \n45,205\n \nElectricity transmission facilities\n15\n to \n75\n18,481\n \n17,562\n \nNatural gas distribution facilities\n15\n to \n60\n17,213\n \n16,324\n \nNatural gas transmission and storage facilities\n15\n to \n68\n11,117\n \n10,496\n \nGeneral plant and other\n5\n to \n50\n10,210\n \n9,165\n \nFinancing lease\n814\n \n787\n \nConstruction work in progress\n4,458\n \n4,452\n \nTotal property, plant, and equipment\n123,534\n \n115,414\n \nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n35,304\n)\n(\n33,093\n)\nNet property, plant, and equipment \n(2)\n$\n88,230\n \n$\n82,321\n \n(1) \nBalance includes nuclear fuel inventories, which are stated at weighted-average cost.  Nuclear fuel in the reactor is expensed as it is used based on the amount of energy output.  See Note 15 below.  Nuclear generating facilities have been authorized by the CPUC to be fully depreciated by December 31, 2025. \n(2)\n Includes $\n3.0\n billion of fire risk mitigation-related property, plant, and equipment securitized in accordance with AB 1054.\n106\nThe Utility depreciates property, plant, and equipment using the composite, or group, method of depreciation, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment balance in a particular class of property, with the exception of its securitized property, plant and equipment, which is depreciated over the life of the bond and in a pattern consistent with principal payments.  This method approximates the straight-line method of depreciation over the useful lives of property, plant, and equipment.  The Utility’s composite depreciation rates were \n3.61\n% in 2024, \n3.56\n% in 2023, and \n3.74\n% in 2022.  The useful lives of the Utility’s property, plant, and equipment are authorized by the CPUC and the FERC, and the depreciation expense is recovered through rates charged to customers.  Depreciation expense includes a component for the original cost of assets and a component for estimated cost of future removal, net of any salvage value at retirement.  Upon retirement, the original cost of the retired assets, net of salvage value, is charged against accumulated depreciation.  The cost of repairs and maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to Operating and maintenance expense as incurred.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction\nAFUDC represents the estimated cost of debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance regulated plant additions before they go into service and is capitalized as part of the cost of construction.  AFUDC is recoverable through rates over the life of the related property once the property is placed in service.  AFUDC related to the cost of debt is recorded as a reduction to interest expense.  AFUDC related to the cost of equity is recorded in other income.\n  The Utility recorded AFUDC related to debt and equity, respectively, of $\n111\n million and $\n184\n million during 2024, $\n82\n million and $\n179\n million during 2023, and $\n81\n million and $\n184\n million during 2022.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the changes in ARO during 2024 and 2023, including nuclear decommissioning obligations:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nARO liability at beginning of year\n$\n5,512\n \n$\n5,912\n \nRevision in estimated cash flows\n(\n290\n)\n(\n585\n)\nAccretion\n269\n \n253\n \nLiabilities settled\n(\n47\n)\n(\n68\n)\nARO liability at end of year\n$\n5,444\n \n$\n5,512\n \nPG&E Corporation and the Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value and its settlement date can be made.  At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.  The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recovered through the ratemaking process.  For more information, see Note 3 below.\nThe Utility has not recorded a liability related to certain AROs for assets that are expected to operate in perpetuity.  As the Utility cannot estimate a settlement date or range of potential settlement dates for these assets, reasonable estimates of fair value cannot be made.  As such, ARO liabilities are not recorded for retirement activities associated with substations, certain hydroelectric facilities; removal of lead-based paint in some facilities and certain communications equipment from leased property; and restoration of land to the conditions under certain agreements.\nTo estimate its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs, escalation rates, credit-adjusted risk-free rates, and estimated decommissioning dates.  For generation facilities, the Utility uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model.  For nuclear generation facilities, the model also considers multiple decommissioning start-year scenarios.  The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the risk associated with the decommissioning obligation.  The Utility performs detailed cost studies of its nuclear generation facilities in conjunction with the NDCTP, most recently performed in 2021, and updates its nuclear AROs accordingly, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios.  The decommissioning cost estimates are based on the plant location and cost characteristics for the Utility’s nuclear power plant.  Actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions such as decommissioning dates; regulatory requirements; technology; and costs of labor, materials, and equipment.  The Utility recovers its revenue requirements for decommissioning costs through rates using a non-bypassable charge that the Utility expects will continue until those costs are fully recovered.\n107\nThe total nuclear decommissioning obligation was $\n4.0\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 based on the cost study performed as part of the 2021 NDCTP.  As of December 31, 2024, the Utility recorded a $\n222\n million reduction to the nuclear decommissioning ARO to reflect the NRC’s decision to grant DCPP’s extended operations until 2030.  The Utility’s ARO could be materially impacted if the Utility does not receive the required federal and state licenses, permits, and approvals.\nDisallowance of Plant Costs\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility record a charge when it is both probable that costs incurred or projected to be incurred for recently completed plant will not be recoverable through rates charged to customers and the amount of disallowance can be reasonably estimated.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trusts\nThe Utility’s nuclear generation facilities consist of \ntwo\n units at DCPP and the Humboldt Bay independent spent fuel storage installation.  Nuclear decommissioning requires the safe removal of a nuclear generation facility from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the NRC license and release of the property for unrestricted use.  The Utility’s nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered through rates and are held in trusts until authorized for release by the CPUC.\nGains or losses on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments are refundable to or recoverable from, respectively, customers through rates.  Therefore, trust earnings are deferred and included in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of the ARO.  There is no impact on the Utility’s earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income.  The cost of debt and equity securities sold by the trust is determined by specific identification.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe Utility participated in various government assistance programs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.  The Utility’s accounting policy is to apply a grant accounting model by analogy to International Accounting Standards 20, \nAccounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance\n.\nAssembly Bill 180\nOn June 30, 2022, AB 180 became law.  AB 180 authorized the DWR to use up to $75 million to support contracts with the owners of electric generating facilities pending retirement, such as DCPP, to fund, reimburse or compensate the owner for any costs, expenses or financial commitments incurred to retain the future availability of such generating facilities pending further legislation.  The resulting agreement between DWR and the Utility was effective beginning October 1, 2022, and will continue until full disbursement of funds or termination per the agreement.  In the event of a termination, the Utility will take reasonable steps to end activities associated with this agreement and will return to DWR any unused funds.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, the amount recorded as a reduction to Cost of electricity for income related to government grants for incurred eligible costs to purchase nuclear fuel was immaterial to the Consolidated Statements of Income.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Consolidated Statements of Income reflected $\n56\n million, as a deduction to Cost of electricity for income related to government grants for incurred eligible costs to purchase nuclear fuel.   \nDWR Loan Agreement\nOn October 18, 2022, the DWR and the Utility executed a $\n1.4\n billion loan agreement to support the extension of DCPP, up to approximately $\n1.1\n billion of which could be repaid by funds received from the DOE (see “U.S. DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program” below).  Under the loan agreement, the DWR pays the Utility a monthly performance-based disbursement equal to $\n7\n for each MWh generated by DCPP, effective September 2, 2022.  The Utility may use the proceeds of the performance-based disbursements for any business purpose, except as profits or dividends to shareholders or as otherwise prohibited by SB 846.  The Utility began earning performance-based disbursements beginning on September 2, 2022 and is eligible to earn performance-based disbursements until the previously-approved retirement dates for DCPP Unit 1 and Unit 2 (2024 and 2025, respectively).  The performance-based disbursements are contingent upon the Utility’s ongoing efforts to pursue extension of and continued safe and reliable operation of DCPP.  The aggregate amount of performance-based disbursements under this agreement will not exceed $\n300\n million.  The Utility received the final proceeds from the DWR loan agreement in 2024.  For more information, see the DWR loan activity table below.\n108\nThe Utility initially accounts for all disbursements from the DWR loan agreement pursuant to ASC 470,\n Debt\n.  When the Utility has reasonable assurance that the DWR will forgive loan disbursements (such as when the Utility earns a performance-based disbursement or when funds expected to be received from the DOE are less than incurred eligible costs), the Utility recognizes those forgiven loans as income related to government grants.  The Utility records the income related to government grants as a deduction to expense in the same period(s) that eligible costs are incurred.\nThe following table summarizes where DWR loan activity is presented in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nLong-term debt: \nBeginning Balance - DWR loan outstanding\n$\n98\n \n$\n312\n \n$\n—\n \nProceeds received\n \n980\n \n—\n \n350\n \nOperating Expenses:\nOperating and maintenance expense - \nPerformance-based disbursements \n(\n117\n)\n(\n124\n)\n(\n38\n)\nOperating and maintenance expense - \nLoan forgiveness and other adjustments\n(\n75\n)\n(\n90\n)\n—\n \nLong-term debt: \nEnding Balance - DWR loan outstanding\n$\n886\n \n$\n98\n \n$\n312\n \nU.S. DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program \nOn January 11, 2024, the Utility and DOE entered into a Credit Award and Payment Agreement for up to $\n1.1\n billion related to DCPP as part of the DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program.  The Utility uses these funds to repay its loans outstanding under the DWR Loan Agreement (see “DWR Loan Agreement” above).  Final award amounts are determined following completion of each year of the award period, and amounts awarded over a four-year award period ending in 2026 will be based on a number of factors, including actual costs incurred to extend the DCPP operations.  When there is reasonable assurance that the Utility will receive funding and comply with the conditions of the DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program, the Utility recognizes such funding as income and records a receivable related to government grants.  During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Consolidated Statements of Income reflected $\n265\n million and $\n115\n million, respectively, as a deduction to \nOperating and maintenance expense\n, for income related to government grants for incurred eligible costs to support the extension of DCPP.  During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Consolidated Statements of Income reflected $\n138\n million and $\n76\n million, as a deduction to Cost of electricity, for income related to government grants for incurred fuel costs to support the extension of DCPP.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or whose equity investors lack any characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  An enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is a primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.\nConsolidated VIEs\nReceivables Securitization Program\nThe SPV was created in connection with the Receivables Securitization Program and is a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, and its assets are not available to creditors of PG&E Corporation or the Utility.  Pursuant to the Receivables Securitization Program, the Utility sells certain of its receivables and certain related rights to payment and obligations of the Utility with respect to such receivables, and certain other related rights to the SPV, which, in turn, obtains loans secured by the receivables from financial institutions (the “Lenders”).  The pledged receivables and the corresponding debt are included in Accounts receivable, Accrued unbilled revenue, Other noncurrent assets, and Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n109\nThe SPV is considered a VIE because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its activities.  The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of the SPV are decisions made to manage receivables.  The Utility is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates the SPV as it makes these decisions.  No additional financial support was provided to the SPV during the year ended December 31, 2024 or is expected to be provided in the future that was not previously contractually required.  As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SPV had net accounts receivable of $\n3.2\n billion and $\n2.7\n billion, respectively, and outstanding borrowings of \nzero\n and $\n1.5\n billion respectively, under the Receivables Securitization Program.  For more information, see Note 4 below.\nAB 1054 Securitization\nPG&E Recovery Funding LLC is a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, and its assets are not available to creditors of PG&E Corporation or the Utility.  Pursuant to the financing orders for the AB 1054 securitization transactions, the Utility sold its right to receive revenues from non-bypassable fixed recovery charges (“Recovery Property”) to PG&E Recovery Funding LLC, which, in turn, issued three separate series of recovery bonds secured by separate Recovery Property.\nPG&E Recovery Funding LLC is considered a VIE because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations.  The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of PG&E Recovery Funding LLC are decisions made by the servicer of the Recovery Property.  The Utility is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates PG&E Recovery Funding LLC as it acts in this role as servicer.  No additional financial support was provided to PG&E Recovery Funding LLC during the year ended December 31, 2024 or is expected to be provided in the future that was not previously contractually required.  On November 12, 2021, November 30, 2022, and August 1, 2024, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued $\n860\n million, $\n983\n million, and $\n1.42\n billion of senior secured recovery bonds, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC had outstanding borrowings of $\n3.2\n billion and $\n1.8\n billion, respectively, included in Long-term debt and Long-term debt, classified as current on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSB 901 Securitization\nPG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC is a bankruptcy remote, limited liability company wholly owned by the Utility, and its assets are not available to creditors of PG&E Corporation or the Utility.  Pursuant to the financing order for the first and second SB 901 securitization transactions, the Utility sold its right to receive revenues from non-bypassable fixed recovery charges (“SB 901 Recovery Property”) to PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, which, in turn, issued two separate series of recovery bonds secured by separate SB 901 Recovery Property.\nPG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC is considered a VIE because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations.  The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC are decisions made by the servicer of the SB 901 Recovery Property.  The Utility is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC as it acts in this role as servicer.  No additional financial support was provided to PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC during the year ended December 31, 2024 or is expected to be provided in the future that was not previously contractually required.  On May 10, 2022 and July 20, 2022, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued $\n3.6\n billion and $\n3.9\n billion of senior secured recovery bonds, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC had outstanding borrowings of $\n7.2\n billion and $\n7.3\n billion respectively, included in Long-term debt and Long-term debt, classified as current on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  For more information, see Note 5 below.\nNon-Consolidated VIEs\nPower Purchase Agreement\ns\nSome of the counterparties to the Utility’s power purchase agreements are considered VIEs.  Each of these VIEs was designed to own a power plant that would generate electricity for sale to the Utility.  To determine whether the Utility was the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs as of December 31, 2024, the Utility assessed whether it absorbs any of the VIE’s expected losses or receives any portion of the VIE’s expected residual returns under the terms of the power purchase agreement, analyzed the variability in the VIE’s gross margin, and considered whether it had any decision-making rights associated with the activities that are most significant to the VIE’s performance, such as dispatch rights or operating and maintenance activities.  The Utility’s financial obligation is limited to the amount the Utility pays for delivered electricity and capacity.  The Utility did not have any decision-making rights associated with any of the activities that are most significant to the economic performance of any of these VIEs.  Since the Utility was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs as of December 31, 2024, it did not consolidate any of them.\n110\nThe Lakeside Building\nBA2 300 Lakeside LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of TMG Bay Area Investments II, LLC, and the Utility are parties to an office lease agreement for approximately \n910,000\n rentable square feet of space within the Lakeside Building, which serves as the Utility’s principal administrative headquarters.\nBA2 300 Lakeside LLC is considered a VIE because the group that holds the equity investment at risk lacks the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity due to a fixed-price purchase option covering more than 50% of the fair value of the assets held by the entity.  The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of BA2 300 Lakeside LLC are decisions related to significant maintenance and remarketing of the property, and the Utility does not have any decision-making rights associated with these activities.  The Utility’s financial obligation is limited to an issued letter of credit, base rent, and certain costs it pays according to the office lease agreement.  As a result, the Utility is not considered the primary beneficiary and does not consolidate BA2 300 Lakeside LLC.  For more information, see “Oakland Headquarters Lease and Purchase” in Note 15 below.\nContributions to the Wildfire Fund Established Pursuant to AB 1054\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility account for contributions to the Wildfire Fund by capitalizing an asset, amortizing ratably over the life of the fund based on an estimated period of coverage, and incrementally adjusting for accelerated amortization as the level of coverage declines, as further described below.  AB 1054 did not specify a period of coverage for the Wildfire Fund, and so this accounting treatment is subject to significant accounting judgments and estim\nates.  In esti\nmating the period of coverage, PG&E Corporation and the Utility used a dataset of historical, publicly available fire-loss data caused by electrical equipment to create Monte Carlo simulations of expected loss.  The number of years of historic fire-loss data and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts by the California electric utility companies are significant assumptions used to estimate the period of coverage.  Other assumptions include the estimated costs to settle wildfire claims for participating electric utilities including the Utility, the CPUC’s determinations of whether costs were just and reasonable in cases of electric utility-caused wildfires and amounts required to be reimbursed to the Wildfire Fund, the impacts of climate change, the FERC-allocable portion of loss recovery, and the future transmission and distribution equity rate base growth of participating electric utilities.  These assumptions create a high degree of uncertainty for the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility re-evaluate the estimated period of coverage annually and as required when additional information becomes available.  Changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact the estimated period of coverage.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility initially estimated a period of coverage of \n15\n years.  In the first quarter of 2024, the annual assessment resulted in the expected life of the Wildfire Fund increasing to \n20\n years after incorporating 2023 loss information into the dataset with no new events triggering a claim against the Wildfire Fund.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility also assess the Wildfire Fund asset for acceleration of the amortization of the asset in the event that claims are made from the Wildfire Fund for catastrophic wildfires.\nAs of December 31, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $\n193\n million in Other current liabilities, $\n564\n million in Other noncurrent liabilities, $\n301\n million in Current assets - Wildfire Fund asset, and $\n4.1\n billion in Noncurrent assets - Wildfire Fund asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  During the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Utility recorded amortization and accretion expense of $\n383\n million and $\n567\n million, respectively.  The amortization of the asset, accretion of the liability, and applicable acceleration of the amortization of the asset are reflected in Wildfire Fund expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor more information, see “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” in Note 14 below.\nOther Accounting Policies\nFor other accounting policies impacting PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements, see “Income Taxes” in Note 9, “Derivatives” in Note 10, “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 11, “Wildfire-Related Contingencies” in Note 14, and “Other Contingencies and Commitments” in Note 15 below.\n111\nReporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe changes, net of income tax, in PG&E Corporation’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted of the following:\n(in millions, net of income tax)\nPension\nBenefits\nOther\nBenefits\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities\n(2)\nTotal\nBeginning balance\n$\n(\n28\n)\n$\n18\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n8\n)\nOther comprehensive income before reclassifications:\nUnrealized gain on investments (net of taxes of $\n0\n, $\n0\n and $\n0\n, respectively)\n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \nUnrecognized net actuarial gain (loss) (net of taxes of $\n104\n, $\n11\n and $\n0\n, respectively)\n(\n268\n)\n29\n \n—\n \n(\n239\n)\nRegulatory account transfer (net of taxes of $\n101\n, $\n11\n and $\n0\n, respectively)\n260\n \n(\n29\n)\n—\n \n231\n \nAmounts reclassified from other comprehensive income:\nAmortization of prior service cost (credit) (net of taxes of $\n1\n, $\n1\n and $\n0\n, respectively)\n (1)\n(\n2\n)\n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAmortization of net actuarial (gain) loss (net of taxes of $\n0\n, $\n6\n and $\n0\n, respectively)\n (1)\n1\n \n(\n16\n)\n—\n \n(\n15\n)\nRegulatory account transfer (net of taxes of $\n1\n, $\n5\n and $\n0\n, respectively)\n (1)\n2\n \n14\n \n—\n \n16\n \nNet current period other comprehensive income\n(\n7\n)\n—\n \n1\n \n(\n6\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n(\n35\n)\n$\n18\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n14\n)\n(1) \nThese components are included in the computation of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.  See Note 12 below for additional details.\n(2)\n Includes amounts related to the customer credit trust and Pacific Energy Risk Solutions, LLC.\nThe changes, net of income tax, in PG&E Corporation’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of the following:\n(in millions, net of income tax)\nPension\nBenefits\nOther\nBenefits\nCustomer Credit Trust\nTotal\nBeginning balance\n$\n(\n12\n)\n$\n18\n \n$\n(\n6\n)\n$\n—\n \nOther comprehensive income before reclassifications:\nUnrealized gain on investments (net of taxes of $\n0\n, $\n0\n and $\n3\n, respectively)\n—\n \n—\n \n8\n \n8\n \nUnrecognized net actuarial gain (loss) (net of taxes of $\n76\n, $\n28\n and $\n0\n, respectively)\n(\n196\n)\n73\n \n—\n \n(\n123\n)\nRegulatory account transfer (net of taxes of $\n70\n, $\n28\n and $\n0\n, respectively)\n180\n \n(\n73\n)\n—\n \n107\n \nAmounts reclassified from other comprehensive income:\nAmortization of prior service cost (credit) (net of taxes of $\n1\n, $\n1\n and $\n0\n, respectively)\n (1)\n(\n3\n)\n2\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nAmortization of net actuarial (gain) loss (net of taxes of $\n0\n, $\n5\n and $\n0\n, respectively)\n(1)\n1\n \n(\n14\n)\n—\n \n(\n13\n)\nRegulatory account transfer (net of taxes of $\n1\n, $\n4\n and $\n0\n, respectively)\n (1)\n2\n \n12\n \n—\n \n14\n \nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n16\n)\n—\n \n8\n \n(\n8\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n(\n28\n)\n$\n18\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n8\n)\n(1) \nThese components are included in the computation of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.  See Note 12 below for additional details.\n112\nRecognition of Lease Assets and Liabilities\nA lease exists when an arrangement allows the lessee to control the use of an identified asset for a stated period in exchange for payments.  This determination is made at inception of the arrangement.  All leases must be recognized as a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet of the lessee.  The ROU asset reflects the lessee’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and the lease liability reflects the obligation to make the lease payments.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components.\nThe Utility estimates the ROU assets and lease liabilities at net present value using its incremental secured borrowing rates unless it can ascertain an implicit discount rate from the leasing arrangement.  The incremental secured borrowing rate is based on observed market data and other information available at the lease commencement date.  The ROU assets and lease liabilities only include the fixed lease payments for arrangements with terms greater than 12 months.  These amounts are presented within the supplemental disclosures of noncash activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Renewal and termination options only impact the lease term if it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.  PG&E Corporation recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  The Utility recognizes lease expense as paid in conformity with ratemaking. \nFinancing Leases\nFinancing leases are included in financing lease ROU assets and current and noncurrent financing lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n  For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Utility made total fixed cash payments of $\n315\n million and $\n142\n million, respectively, for financing leases, which were included in the measurement of financing lease liabilities and are presented within financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Financing leases were immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2022.  Any variable lease payments for financing leases are included in operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  The majority of the Utility’s financing lease ROU assets and lease liabilities relate to the Oakland Headquarters lease discussed below.\nOakland Headquarters Lease and Purchase\nOn October 23, 2020, the Utility and BA2 300 Lakeside LLC (“Landlord”), a wholly owned subsidiary of TMG Bay Area Investments II, LLC, entered into an office lease agreement for approximately \n910,000\n rentable square feet of space within the Lakeside Building to serve as the Utility’s principal administrative headquarters (the “Lease”).  In connection with the Lease, the Utility also issued to Landlord (i) an option payment letter of credit in the amount of $\n75\n million, and (ii) a lease security letter of credit in the amount of $\n75\n million.  The term of the Lease began on April 8, 2022.\nThe Lease also requires the rentable space to be delivered in two phases, with each phase consisting of multiple subphases.  As of December 31, 2024, the Landlord has made available approximately \n715,000\n rentable square feet of the leased premises for the Utility’s use. \nOn July 11, 2023, the Utility and the Landlord entered into an Amendment to Office Lease and an Agreement of Purchase and Sale and Joint Escrow Instructions, pursuant to which the Utility was deemed to have exercised its option to purchase the legal parcel that contains the Lakeside Building (the “Property”), as modified.   Pursuant to the Agreement of Purchase and Sale and Joint Escrow Instructions, the purchase price of the Property will be $\n906\n million, with deposits applicable to such purchase price of $\n150\n million paid by July 11, 2023, $\n250\n million paid by July 11, 2024, and the remaining $\n506\n million to be paid at closing on or before June 3, 2025.  The Utility will also receive a credit of approximately $\n172\n million towards the final payment, subject to adjustments, which represents the estimated outstanding principal balance of a loan carried by the Property that will be assigned to, and assumed by, the Utility at closing.  The Utility will continue to lease the Property pursuant to the Lease, as amended, until closing.\nThe execution of the Amendment to Office Lease Agreement on July 11, 2023 triggered a modification of the Lease, which resulted in the Lease being remeasured and reclassified from an operating lease to a financing lease during the year ended 2023.\n113\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Utility has recorded $\n807\n million in Financing lease ROU assets, $\n282\n million in accumulated amortization, $\n136\n million in leasehold improvements, net of accumulated amortization, which includes $\n51\n million that was provided to the Utility as lease incentives, and $\n575\n million in current Financing lease liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily related to the Lease, as amended.  As of December 31, 2023, the Utility recorded $\n787\n million in Financing lease ROU assets, $\n108\n million in accumulated amortization, $\n218\n million in leasehold improvements, net of accumulated amortization, which includes $\n134\n million that was provided to the Utility as lease incentives, $\n259\n million in current Financing lease liabilities, and $\n554\n million in noncurrent Financing lease liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily related to the Lease, as amended.  \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Utility’s financing lease had a weighted average remaining lease term of \n0.5\n years and \n1.6\n years and a weighted average discount rate of \n6.2\n% and \n6.5\n%, respectively. \nThe following table shows the lease cost recognized for the fixed and variable component of the Utility’s lease obligations:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nFinancing lease fixed cost:\nAmortization of ROU assets\n$\n274\n \n$\n115\n \nInterest on lease liabilities\n42\n \n27\n \nFinancing lease variable cost\n9\n \n3\n \nTotal financing lease costs\n$\n325\n \n$\n145\n \nAt December 31, 2024, the Utility expects to pay $\n591\n million of lease payments in 2025. \nOperating Leases\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets and current and noncurrent Operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Utility made total cash payments, including fixed and variable, of $\n1.6\n billion, $\n1.9\n billion, and $\n2.3\n billion, respectively, for operating leases which are presented within operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \nThe majority of the Utility’s operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities relate to various power purchase agreements.  These power purchase agreements primarily consist of generation plants leased to meet customer demand plus applicable reserve margins.  Operating lease variable costs include amounts from renewable energy power purchase agreements where payments are based on certain contingent external factors such as wind, hydro, solar, biogas, and biomass power generation.  See “Third-Party Power Purchase Agreements” in Note 15 below.  \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Utility’s operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of \n7.5\n years and \n8.2\n years and a weighted average discount rate of \n6.5\n% and \n6.4\n%, respectively.\nThe following table shows the lease cost recognized for the fixed and variable component of the Utility’s lease obligations:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating lease fixed cost\n$\n116\n \n$\n269\n \n$\n500\n \nOperating lease variable cost\n1,524\n \n1,632\n \n1,829\n \nTotal operating lease costs\n$\n1,640\n \n$\n1,901\n \n$\n2,329\n \n114\nAt December 31, 2024, the Utility’s future expected operating lease payments were as follows: \n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\n2025\n$\n116\n \n2026\n112\n \n2027\n110\n \n2028\n97\n \n2029\n62\n \nThereafter\n195\n \nTotal lease payments\n692\n \nLess imputed interest\n(\n173\n)\nTotal\n$\n519\n \nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards \nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n, which amended the existing guidance to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility adopted this ASU in December 2024.  See “Segment Reporting” above for additional disclosures as a result of adopting this ASU.  There was no material impact on PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements resulting from the adoption of this ASU.  \nAccounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09\n, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, \nwhich amends the existing guidance to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures.  The standard requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction.  This ASU became effective for PG&E Corporation and the Utility on January 1, 2025.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not expect the guidance to have a significant impact on their Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, \nIncome Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n, which amends the existing guidance to require disclosure, in the notes to the financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses.  This ASU will become effective for PG&E Corporation and the Utility for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are currently evaluating the impact the guidance will have on their Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nInduced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-04, \nDebt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments,\n which amends the existing guidance by clarifying the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as induced conversions.  Under this ASU, to account for a settlement of a convertible debt instrument as an induced conversion, an inducement offer is required to provide the debt holder with, at a minimum, the consideration (in form and amount) issuable under the conversion privileges provided in the terms of the instrument.  An entity should assess whether this criterion is satisfied as of the date the inducement offer is accepted by the holder.  This ASU will become effective for PG&E Corporation and the Utility for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are currently evaluating the impact the guidance will have on their Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\n115\nNOTE 3: REGULATORY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND BALANCING ACCOUNTS\nRegulatory Assets\nIn general, regulatory assets represent the cumulative differences between amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes and expense or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) recognized in accordance with GAAP.  The Utility does not earn a return on regulatory assets if the related costs do not accrue interest.\nNoncurrent regulatory assets are comprised of the following:\n \nBalance at December 31,\nRecovery\nPeriod\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nPension benefits\n (1)\n$\n673\n \n$\n348\n \nIndefinitely\nEnvironmental compliance costs\n1,172\n \n1,218\n \n32\n years\nPrice risk management\n167\n \n160\n \nup to \n15.5\n years\nCatastrophic event memorandum account \n(2)\n742\n \n1,074\n \nVarious\nWildfire-related accounts \n(3)\n1,697\n \n2,915\n \n1\n - \n3\n years\nDeferred income taxes \n(4)\n4,771\n \n3,543\n \nVarious\nFinancing costs \n(5)\n216\n \n196\n \nVarious\nSB 901 securitization \n(6)\n5,194\n \n5,249\n \n28\n years\nGeneral rate case memorandum accounts \n(7)\n95\n \n1,291\n \nVarious\nOther\n834\n \n1,195\n \nVarious\nTotal noncurrent regulatory assets\n$\n15,561\n \n$\n17,189\n \n \n(1) \nPayments into the pension and other benefits plans are based on annual contribution requirements.  As these annual requirements continue indefinitely into the future, the Utility expects to continuously recover pension benefits.\n(2\n) \nIncludes costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergency by competent federal or state authorities.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $\n1\n million and $\n43\n million in COVID-19 related costs were recorded to CEMA regulatory assets, respectively.  Recovery of CEMA costs is subject to CPUC review and approval.\n(3\n) \n Represents costs associated with wildfire mitigation and prevention activities and includes the WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, WMBA, VMBA and MGMA.\n(4)\n Represents cumulative differences between amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes and expense recognized in accordance with GAAP.\n(5)\n Includes costs associated with long-term debt financing deemed recoverable under ASC 980, \nRegulated Operations\n more than twelve months from the current date.  These costs and their amortization periods are reviewed and approved in the Utility’s cost of capital or other regulatory filings.\n(6)\n In connection with the SB 901 securitization, the CPUC authorized the issuance of recovery bonds to finance $\n7.5\n billion of claims associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires.  The balance represents PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC’s right to recover $\n7.5\n billion in wildfire claims costs associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires, partially offset by the\n $\n2.0\n billion\n in required upfront shareholder contributions to the customer credit trust, net of amortization since inception.  The recovery bonds will be paid through fixed recovery charges, which are designed to recover the full scheduled principal amount of the recovery bonds along with any associated interest and financing costs.  See \nNote 5\n below.\n(7)\n \nThe GRC memorandum accounts track the differences between the revenue requirements in effect on January 1, 2023 and the revenue requirements authorized by the CPUC in the 2023 GRC final decision in December 2023 to be collected over 24 months.  The balance as of December 31, 2024 relates to revenue to be recognized related to gas transmission and storage capital expenditures incurred during the period from 2011 to 2014.  This revenue is being recognized over 60 months, which began in August 2022.\nRegulatory Liabilities\nCurrent Regulatory Liabilities\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Utility had current regulatory liabilities of $\n1.2\n billion.  At December 31, 2024, current regulatory liabilities consisted primarily of billed revenues exceeding TO20 transmission revenue requirements\n.\n  Current regulatory liabilities are included within Current liabilities-other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n116\nNoncurrent Regulatory Liabilities\nNoncurrent regulatory liabilities are comprised of the following:\n \nBalance at December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nCost of removal obligations\n (1)\n$\n8,943\n \n$\n8,191\n \nPublic purpose programs\n (2)\n1,112\n \n1,238\n \nEmployee benefit plans\n (3)\n1,088\n \n1,032\n \nTransmission tower wireless licenses\n (4)\n306\n \n384\n \nSFGO sale\n (5)\n79\n \n185\n \nSB 901 securitization\n (6)\n6,295\n \n6,628\n \nWildfire self-insurance \n(7)\n804\n \n407\n \nOther\n790\n \n1,379\n \nTotal noncurrent regulatory liabilities\n$\n19,417\n \n$\n19,444\n \n(1) \nRepresents the cumulative differences between the recorded costs to remove assets and amounts collected through rates for expected costs to remove assets.\n(2)\n Represents amounts received from customers designated for public purpose program costs expected to be incurred beyond the next 12 months, primarily related to energy efficiency programs.\n(3)\n Represents cumulative differences between incurred costs and amounts collected through rates for post-retirement medical, post-retirement life, and long-term disability plans. \n(4)\n Represents the portion of the net proceeds received from the sale of transmission tower wireless licenses that will be returned to customers through 2042.  Of the $\n306\n million, $\n273\n million will be refunded to FERC-jurisdictional customers, and $\n33\n million will be refunded to CPUC-jurisdictional customers.\n(5)\n Represents the noncurrent portion of the net gain on the sale of the SFGO, which is being distributed to customers over a five-year period that began in 2022.\n(6) \nIn connection with the SB 901 securitization, the Utility is required to return up to $\n7.59\n billion of certain shareholder tax benefits to customers via periodic bill credits over the life of the recovery bonds.  The balance reflects qualifying shareholder tax benefits that PG&E Corporation is obligated to contribute to the customer credit trust, net of amortization since inception.  See Note 5 below.\n(7)  \nRepresents amounts collected through rates designated for wildfire self-insurance.  See Note 14 below.\nRegulatory Balancing Accounts\nThe Utility tracks (1) differences between the Utility’s authorized revenue requirement and customer billings, and (2) differences between incurred costs and customer billings.  To the extent these differences are probable of recovery or refund over the next 12 months, the Utility records a current regulatory balancing account receivable or payable.  Regulatory balancing accounts that the Utility expects to collect or refund over a period exceeding 12 months are recorded as other noncurrent assets – regulatory assets or noncurrent liabilities – regulatory liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These differences do not have an impact on net income.  Balancing accounts fluctuate during the year based on seasonal electric and gas usage and timing differences between when costs are incurred and customer revenues are collected.  \nSome regulatory balancing accounts receivable earn interest which is reflected in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Some regulatory balancing accounts payable accrue interest which is reflected in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Further, the facility availability may vary based on the amount of accounts receivable that the Utility owns that are eligible for sale to the SPV and the portion of those accounts receivable that are sold to the SPV that are eligible for advances by the lenders under the Receivables Securitization Program.\nUtility\nOn April 16, 2024, the Utility amended its existing term loan agreement to combine its $\n400\n million 2-year tranche loan maturing April 19, 2024 and its $\n125\n million 364-day tranche loan maturing April 16, 2024 into a single loan of $\n525\n million maturing April 15, 2025.  The loan bears interest based on the Utility’s election of either (1) Term SOFR (plus a \n0.10\n% credit spread adjustment) plus an applicable margin of \n1.375\n% or (2) the alternative base rate plus an applicable margin of \n0.375\n%.\nOn June 26, 2024, the Utility amended its existing Receivables Securitization Program to, among other things, extend the scheduled termination date from June 9, 2025 to June 26, 2026. \nOn June 28, 2024, the Utility amended its then-existing bridge term loan credit agreement to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date from August 15, 2024 to December 16, 2024, and (ii) modify the mandatory prepayment provision to require the Utility to prepay term loans outstanding under such credit agreement, subject to certain exceptions, with 100% of the net cash proceeds received by the Utility from the issuance of debt securities or incurrence of any debt under any bank credit facilities (excluding AB 1054 securitizations and the Utility’s revolving credit agreement).  As of December 31, 2024, the bridge term loan was no longer outstanding. \nOn July 25, 2024, the Utility amended its existing revolving credit agreement to extend the maturity date for commitments representing $\n4.196\n billion in the aggregate from June 22, 2028 to June 22, 2029 (subject to a \none-year\n extension at the option of the Utility).

On February 16, 2024, CPUC issued a final decision approving a third transaction to use securitization to finance the recovery of up to $\n1.38\n billion of fire risk mitigation capital expenditure amounts that have been or would be incurred by the Utility from August 1, 2019 through the second quarter of 2024.  In addition, the final decision authorized one or more series of recovery bonds and authorized the Utility to collect a non-bypassable charge sufficient to pay debt service on the recovery bonds.\n119\nOn August 1, 2024, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued approximately $\n1.42\n billion of senior secured recovery bonds.  The senior secured recovery bonds were issued in three tranches: (1) approximately $\n300\n million with an interest rate of \n4.838\n% due June 1, 2035, (2) approximately $\n373\n million with an interest rate of \n5.231\n% due June 1, 2042, and (3) approximately $\n746\n million with an interest rate of \n5.529\n% due June 1, 2051.  The payment dates for the senior secured recovery bonds are June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2025 and continuing until the final repayment date.  PG&E Recovery Funding LLC and the Utility entered into certain agreements in connection with the issuance of the senior secured recovery bonds, including (1) the Recovery Property Servicing Agreement (“the Servicing Agreement”), (2) the Recovery Property Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Sale Agreement”), and (3) the Administration Agreement (the “Administration Agreement”), each dated as of August 1, 2024.\nPursuant to the agreements described above, the Utility sells rights and interests in the Recovery Property created pursuant to the Wildfire Financing Law and the Financing Order (each as defined in the Sale Agreement) to PG&E Recovery Funding LLC; the Utility carries out the functions pursuant to the Servicing Agreement to determine the Fixed Recovery Charges (as defined in the Sale Agreement); and the Utility provides corporate management services to PG&E Recovery Funding LLC pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Utility used the proceeds of the sale of the Recovery Property in accordance with the Wildfire Financing Law and the Financing Order.\nFor more information on PG&E Recovery Funding LLC, see “Variable Interest Entities” in Note 2 above.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nOn September 5, 2024, the Utility completed the sale of $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds due 2025.  The Utility used the net proceeds for the repayment of a portion of borrowings outstanding under its then-existing bridge term loan credit agreement. \nLong-Term Debt Issuances and Redemptions\nUtility\nOn February 28, 2024, the Utility completed the sale of (i) $\n850\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.550\n% First Mortgage Bonds due 2029, (ii) $\n1.1\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.800\n% First Mortgage Bonds due 2034 and (iii) $\n300\n million aggregate principal amount of \n6.750\n% First Mortgage Bonds due 2053.  The Utility used the net proceeds for the repayment of borrowings outstanding under the Utility’s revolving credit facility pursuant to the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOn September 5, 2024, the Utility completed the sale of $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.900\n% First Mortgage Bonds due 2054.  The Utility used the net proceeds for the repayment of a portion of borrowings outstanding under its then-existing bridge term loan credit agreement.\nPG&E Corporation\nOn September 11, 2024, PG&E Corporation completed the sale of $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n7.375\n% Fixed-to-Fixed Reset Rate Junior Subordinated Notes due 2055.  These notes initially bear interest at the rate of \n7.375\n% per annum, and beginning March 15, 2030 and every five year anniversary thereafter, the interest rate will be reset to an amount that is equal to the five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus \n3.883\n% (but not below \n7.375\n%).  PG&E Corporation used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to fully prepay all loans outstanding under its existing term loan agreement in an aggregate principal amount equal to $\n500\n million.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, PG&E Corporation recognized a $\n9\n million loss within Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income related to the early extinguishment and associated write-off of deferred debt issuance costs of the term loan agreement.\nOn November 15, 2024, PG&E Corporation completed the sale of an additional $\n500\n million aggregate principal amount of \n7.375\n% Fixed-to-Fixed Reset Rate Junior Subordinated Notes due 2055.  These notes initially bear interest at the rate of \n7.375\n% per annum, and beginning March 15, 2030 and every five year anniversary thereafter, the interest rate will be reset to an amount that is equal to the five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus \n3.883\n% (but not below \n7.375\n%).  PG&E Corporation used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\n120\nConvertible Notes\nOn December 4, 2023, PG&E Corporation completed the sale of $\n2.15\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n4.25\n% convertible senior secured notes due December 1, 2027 (the “Convertible Notes”).  The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of \n4.25\n% with interest payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2024.  The net proceeds from these offerings were approximately $\n2.12\n billion, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and PG&E Corporation’s offering expenses.  PG&E Corporation used the net proceeds to prepay $\n2.15\n billion outstanding under its term loan agreement.\nThe Convertible Notes are governed by an indenture (the “Convertible Notes Indenture”).  The Convertible Notes Indenture contains limited covenants, including those restricting PG&E Corporation’s ability and certain of PG&E Corporation’s subsidiaries’ ability to create liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions or merge or consolidate with another entity.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2027, the Convertible Notes will be convertible by means of Combination Settlement (as described below) when the following conditions are met:\n•\nduring any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2024, if the last reported sale price of PG&E Corporation’s common stock for at least \n20\n trading days during the period of \n30\n consecutive trading days ending on, and including the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to \n130\n% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\n•\nduring the \nfive\n consecutive business day period immediately after any \n10\n consecutive trading day period (“measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, as determined following a request by a holder of Convertible Notes in accordance with the procedures described in the Convertible Notes Indenture, for each trading day of the measurement period was less than \n90\n% of the product of the last reported sale price of PG&E Corporation’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or\n•\nupon specified distributions and corporate events described in the Convertible Notes Indenture.\nOn or after September 1, 2027, the Convertible Notes are convertible by means of Combination Settlement (as described below) by holders at any time in whole or in part until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date.\nOn December 8, 2023, PG&E Corporation delivered an irrevocable notice (the “Irrevocable Notice”) to the Trustee under the Convertible Notes Indenture to irrevocably fix the Settlement Method upon conversion to Combination Settlement with a Specified Dollar Amount (each as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes at or above $1,000 for any conversions of the Convertible Notes occurring subsequent to the delivery of such Irrevocable Notice on December 8, 2023; provided that in no event shall the Specified Dollar Amount per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes be less than $1,000.\nThe conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is initially 43.146 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $\n23.18\n per share of PG&E Corporation common stock).  The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price are subject to adjustment in connection with some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.  PG&E Corporation may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date.\nIf PG&E Corporation undergoes a Fundamental Change (other than an Exempted Fundamental Change, each as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders may require PG&E Corporation to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture).  As of December 31, 2024, none of the conditions allowing holders of the Convertible Notes to convert had been met.\n121\nThe Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 470-20, \nDebt with Conversion and Other Options\n. Pursuant to ASC Subtopic 470-20, debt with an embedded conversion feature should be accounted for in its entirety as a liability, and no portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt instrument should be accounted for as attributable to the conversion feature unless the conversion feature is required to be accounted for separately as an embedded derivative or the conversion feature results in a premium that is subject to the guidance in ASC 470.  The Convertible Notes issued are accounted for as a liability with no portion of the proceeds attributable to the conversion options as the conversion feature did not require separate accounting as a derivative, and the Convertible Notes did not involve a premium subject to the guidance in ASC 470.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Consolidated Financial Statements reflected the net carrying amount of the Convertible Notes of $\n2.13\n billion and $\n2.12\n billion, with unamortized debt issuance costs of $\n20\n million and $\n27\n million, respectively, in Long-term debt.  For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Consolidated Statements of Income reflected the total interest expense of approximately $\n98\n million and $\n7\n million, respectively. \n122\nThe following table summarizes PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Long-term debt: \nBalance at\n(in millions)\nContractual Interest Rates\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nPG&E Corporation\nTerm Loan \n7.85\n%\n$\n—\n \n$\n500\n \nConvertible Notes due 2027\n4.25\n%\n2,150\n \n2,150\n \nSenior Secured Notes due 2028\n5.00\n%\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \nSenior Secured Notes due 2030\n5.25\n%\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \nJunior Subordinated Notes due 2055\n7.38\n%\n1,500\n \n—\n \nUnamortized discount, premium and debt issuance costs, net\n(\n39\n)\n(\n51\n)\nTotal PG&E Corporation Long-Term Debt\n5,611\n \n4,599\n \nUtility\nFirst Mortgage Bonds - Stated Maturity:\n2024\n3.40\n% - \n3.75\n%\n—\n \n800\n \n2025\n3.45\n% - \n4.95\n%\n1,925\n \n1,925\n \n2026\n2.95\n% - \n3.15\n%\n2,551\n \n2,551\n \n2027\n2.10\n% -  \n5.45\n%\n3,000\n \n3,000\n \n2028\n3.00\n% - \n4.65\n%\n1,975\n \n1,975\n \n2029\n4.20\n% - \n6.10\n%\n2,100\n \n1,250\n \n2030\n \n4.55\n%\n3,100\n \n3,100\n \n2031\n2.50\n% - \n3.25\n%\n3,000\n \n3,000\n \n2032\n4.40\n% -  \n5.90\n%\n1,050\n \n1,050\n \n2033\n6.15\n% - \n6.40\n%\n1,900\n \n1,900\n \n2034\n5.80\n%  -  \n6.95\n%\n1,900\n \n800\n \n2040\n3.30\n% - \n4.50\n%\n2,951\n \n2,951\n \n2041\n4.20\n% - \n4.50\n%\n700\n \n700\n \n2042\n3.75\n% - \n4.45\n%\n750\n \n750\n \n2043\n4.60\n%\n375\n \n375\n \n2044\n4.75\n%\n675\n \n675\n \n2045\n4.30\n%\n600\n \n600\n \n2046\n4.00\n% - \n4.25\n%\n1,050\n \n1,050\n \n2047\n \n3.95\n%\n850\n \n850\n \n2050\n3.50\n% - \n4.95\n%\n5,025\n \n5,025\n \n2052\n5.25\n%\n550\n \n550\n \n2053\n6.70\n% - \n6.75\n%\n2,300\n \n2,000\n \n2054\n5.90\n%\n750\n \n—\n \nLess: current portion, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs\n(\n1,924\n)\n(\n800\n)\nUnamortized discount, premium and debt issuance costs, net\n(\n226\n)\n(\n246\n)\nTotal Utility First Mortgage Bonds\n36,927\n \n35,831\n \nRecovery Bonds \n(1)\n10,367\n \n9,124\n \n         Less: current portion\n(\n222\n)\n(\n176\n)\nDWR Loan \n(2)\n886\n \n98\n \nCredit Facilities \nReceivables Securitization Program \n6.75\n%\n—\n \n1,499\n \n2-Year Term Loan \n6.60\n%\n—\n \n400\n \nLess: current portion\n—\n \n(\n400\n)\nTotal Utility Long-Term Debt\n47,958\n \n46,376\n \nTotal PG&E Corporation Consolidated Long-Term Debt\n$\n53,569\n \n$\n50,975\n \n(1)\n The amount includes bonds related to AB 1054 and SB 901 securitization transactions.

For SB 901 interest rates, see the 2022 Form 10-K.\nNOTE 5: \nSB 901 SECURITIZATION AND CUSTOMER CREDIT TRUST\nPursuant to the financing order for the SB 901 securitization transactions, the Utility sold its right to receive revenues from the SB 901 Recovery Property to PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC, which, in turn, issued the recovery bonds secured by separate fixed recovery charges and separate SB 901 Recovery Property.  The fixed recovery charges are designed to recover the full scheduled principal amount of the applicable series of recovery bonds along with any associated interest and financing costs.  The customer credit trust (see Note 11 below) funds a customer credit to ratepayers, designed to equal the recovery bond principal, interest, and financing costs over the life of the recovery bonds to offset the fixed recovery charge.  The fixed recovery charges and customer credits are presented on a net basis in Operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income and had no net impact on Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nUpon issuance of senior secured recovery bonds in May 2022 (“inception”), the Utility recorded a $\n5.5\n billion SB 901 securitization regulatory asset reflecting PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC’s right to recover $\n7.5\n billion in wildfire claims costs associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires, partially offset by the $\n2.0\n billion in required upfront shareholder contributions to the customer credit trust.  Of the $\n2.0\n billion in required upfront shareholder contributions, $\n1.0\n billion was contributed to the customer credit trust in 2022, $\n350\n million was contributed on March 28, 2024, and $\n650\n million is required to be contributed no later than March 31, 2025 unless certain conditions are met requiring an earlier contribution or unless otherwise ordered by the CPUC.  The Utility also recorded a $\n5.54\n billion SB 901 securitization regulatory liability at inception, which represents certain shareholder tax benefits the Utility had previously recognized that will be returned to customers.  As the Fire Victim Trust sold PG&E Corporation common stock shares it held, the SB 901 securitization regulatory liability increased accordingly.  As tax benefits are monetized, contributions will be made to the customer credit trust, up to $\n7.59\n billion.  The Utility expects to amortize the SB 901 securitization regulatory asset and liability over the life of the recovery bonds, with such amortization reflected in Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Utility recorded $\n328\n million for amortization of the regulatory asset and liability in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Utility recorded SB 901 securitization charges, net, of $\n1.3\n billion for tax benefits realized within Income tax expense related to the Fire Victim Trust’s sale of PG&E Corporation common stock and $\n322\n million for amortization of the regulatory asset and liability in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \n124\nThe following tables illustrate the changes in the SB 901 securitization’s impact on the Utility’s regulatory assets and liabilities:\nSB 901 securitization regulatory asset\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nBalance at\n \nJanuary 1\n$\n5,249\n \n$\n5,378\n \nAmortization\n(\n55\n)\n(\n129\n)\nBalance at December 31\n$\n5,194\n \n$\n5,249\n \nSB 901 securitization regulatory liability\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nBalance at January 1\n$\n(\n6,628\n)\n$\n(\n5,800\n)\nAmortization\n383\n \n451\n \nAdditions\n(1)\n(\n50\n)\n(\n1,279\n)\nBalance at December 31\n$\n(\n6,295\n)\n$\n(\n6,628\n)\n(1)\n Includes $\n16\n million and $\n12\n million of returns on investments in the customer credit trust expected to be credited to customers for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNOTE 6: \nCOMMON STOCK AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nPG&E Corporation had \n2,193,573,536\n shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2024.  PG&E Corporation held all of the Utility’s outstanding common stock at December 31, 2024.\nOn December 4, 2024, PG&E Corporation issued \n55,961,070\n shares of common stock, no par value, for cash proceeds of approximately $\n1.13\n billion.  The proceeds from this issuance are intended to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, to fund its \nfive-year\n capital investment plan.\nOwnership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles\nUnder Section 382 of the IRC, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations (which could limit PG&E Corporation or the Utility’s ability to use these deferred tax assets to offset taxable income).  In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate value of the stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five percent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).  The Amended Articles limit Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles) that increase a person’s or entity’s (including certain groups of persons) ownership of PG&E Corporation’s equity securities to \n4.75\n% or more prior to the Restriction Release Date (as defined in the Amended Articles) without approval by the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation.\nShares of PG&E Corporation common stock held directly by the Utility are attributed to PG&E Corporation for income tax purposes and are therefore effectively excluded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person’s Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the \n4.75\n% ownership limitation in the Amended Articles.  Accordingly, although PG&E Corporation had \n2,671,320,389\n common shares outstanding as of February 5, 2025, only \n2,193,576,799\n common shares (the number of outstanding shares of common stock less the number of shares held directly by the Utility) count as outstanding for purposes of the ownership restrictions in the Amended Articles with the result that the ownership limitation based on the unadjusted outstanding stock of PG&E Corporation is lower than \n4.75\n% and can vary based on the relative value of the common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock on any particular date.\nAs of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and consequently, its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the IRC.\n125\nDividends\nCPUC holding company rules require that the Utility’s dividend policy be established by the Utility’s Board of Directors on the same basis as if the Utility were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of Utility, as deemed to be necessary to meet the Utility’s electricity service obligations, shall receive first priority from the Boards of Directors of both PG&E Corporation and the Utility.  The CPUC requires the Utility to maintain a capital structure composed of at least 52% equity on average.  The CPUC has granted the Utility a temporary waiver from compliance with its authorized capital structure until 2025 for the financing in place upon the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.\nCalifornia law also requires that for a dividend to be declared: (a) retained earnings must equal to or exceed the proposed dividend, or (b) immediately after the dividend is made, the value of the corporation’s assets must exceed the value of its liabilities plus amounts required to be paid, if any, in order to liquidate stock senior to the shares receiving the dividend.  A California corporation may not declare a dividend if it is, or as a result of the dividend would be, likely to be unable to meet its liabilities as they mature.\nAdditionally, neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility may pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on PG&E Corporation’s Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and the Utility’s preferred stock, respectively, have been paid.\nSubject to the foregoing restrictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Boards of Directors and will depend on, among other things, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Boards of Directors may deem relevant.\nUtility\nOn each of February 13, May 16, and September 19, and November 29, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared common stock dividends of $\n450\n million, $\n500\n million, $\n500\n million, and $\n575\n million, which were paid to PG&E Corporation on March 25, June 3, September 20, and December 24, 2024, respectively. \nPG&E Corporation\nOn each of February 13, May 16, and September 19, 2024, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $\n0.01\n per share, each declaration totaling $\n21\n million, which were paid on April 15, July 15, and October 15, 2024, to holders of record as of March 28, June 28 and September 30, 2024, respectively.  On November 29, 2024, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a new quarterly common stock dividend of $\n0.025\n per share, totaling $\n55\n million, which was paid on January 15, 2025, to holders of record as of December 31, 2024.\nLong-Term Incentive Plans\nThe LTIP (i.e., the PG&E Corporation 2014 LTIP or the PG&E Corporation 2021 LTIP, as applicable) permits various forms of share-based incentive awards, including stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares, and other share-based awards, to eligible employees of PG&E Corporation and its subsidiaries.  Non-employee directors of PG&E Corporation are also eligible to receive certain share-based awards.  A maximum of \n91\n million shares of PG&E Corporation common stock (subject to certain adjustments) has been reserved for issuance under the LTIP, of which \n55,900,800\n shares were available for future awards at December 31, 2024.\nThe following table provides a summary of total share-based compensation expense recognized by PG&E Corporation for share-based incentive awards for 2024:\n(in\n \nmillions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRestricted stock units\n67\n \n64\n \n60\n \nPerformance shares\n31\n \n27\n \n55\n \nTotal compensation expense (pre-tax)\n$\n98\n \n$\n91\n \n$\n115\n \nTotal compensation expense (after-tax)\n$\n71\n \n$\n65\n \n$\n83\n \nShare-based compensation costs are generally not capitalized.  There was no material difference between PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the information disclosed above.\n126\nStock Options\nThe exercise price of stock options granted under the LTIP and all other outstanding stock options is equal to the market price of PG&E Corporation’s common stock on the date of grant.  Stock options generally have a \n10\n-year term and vest over \nthree years\n of continuous service, subject to accelerated vesting in certain circumstances.  As of December 31, 2024, there were \nno\n unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock options for PG&E Corporation.\nThe fair value of each stock option on the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation method.  \nNo\n stock options were granted in 2024 or 2023.\nExpected volatilities are based on historical volatility of PG&E Corporation’s common stock.  The expected dividend payment is the dividend yield at the date of grant.  The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual term of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury rates in effect at the date of grant.  The expected life of stock options is derived from historical data that estimates stock option exercises and employee departure behavior.\nThere was no tax benefit recognized from stock options for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for PG&E Corporation and the Utility for 2024:\nNumber of\nStock Options\nWeighted Average Grant-\nDate Fair Value\nWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years)\nOutstanding at January 1\n1,396,261\n \n$\n8.2\n \nGranted\n (1)\n—\n \n— \nExercised\n—\n \n— \nForfeited or expired\n(\n652,298\n)\n6.89\n \nOutstanding at December 31\n743,963\n \n10.23\n \n2.58\nVested or expected to vest at December 31\n743,963\n \n10.23\n \n2.58\nExercisable at December 31\n743,963\n \n$\n10.23\n \n2.58\n(1) \nRepresents additional payout of existing stock option grants.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units generally vest equally over \nthree years\n.  Vested restricted stock units are settled in shares of PG&E Corporation common stock accompanied by cash payments to settle any dividend equivalents associated with the vested restricted stock units.  Compensation expense is generally recognized ratably over the vesting period based on grant-date fair value.  The weighted average grant-date fair value for restricted stock units granted during 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $\n16.74\n, $\n15.70\n, and $\n11.40\n, respectively.  The total fair value of restricted stock units that vested during 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $\n62\n million, $\n64\n million, and $\n46\n million, respectively.  The tax benefit from restricted stock units that vested in 2024 was $\n21\n million.  In general, forfeitures are recorded ratably over the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2024, $\n90\n million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of \n1.52\n years.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity for 2024:\nNumber of\nRestricted Stock Units\nWeighted Average Grant-\nDate Fair Value\nNonvested at January 1\n9,268,425\n \n$\n13.29\n \nGranted\n5,273,850\n \n16.74\n \nVested\n(\n4,922,000\n)\n12.62\n \nForfeited\n(\n196,693\n)\n15.27\n \nNonvested at December 31\n9,423,582\n \n$\n15.52\n \n127\nPerformance Shares\nPerformance shares generally vest \nthree\n years after the grant date.  Following vesting, performance shares are settled in shares of common stock based on either PG&E Corporation’s total shareholder return relative to a specified group of industry peer companies over a \nthree\n-year performance period (“TSR”) or an internal PG&E Corporation metric (subject in some instances to a multiplier based on TSR).  Dividend equivalents, if any, are paid in cash based on the amount of common stock to which the recipients are entitled.\nCompensation expense attributable to performance shares is generally recognized ratably over the applicable \nthree\n-year period based on the grant-date fair value determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model for the TSR-based awards or the grant-date market value of PG&E Corporation common stock for awards based on internal metrics.  The weighted average grant-date fair value for performance shares granted during 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $\n16.94\n, $\n13.39\n, and $\n13.44\n respectively.  In general, forfeitures are recorded ratably over the vesting period, using historical averages and adjusted to actuals when vesting occurs.  As of December 31, 2024, $\n48\n million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance shares was expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of \n1.17\n years.\nThe following table summarizes activity for performance shares in 2024:\nNumber of\nPerformance Shares\nWeighted Average Grant-\nDate Fair Value\nNonvested at January 1\n6,602,292\n \n$\n14.06\n \nGranted\n2,714,196\n \n16.94\n \nVested\n(\n1,779,695\n)\n10.70\n \nForfeited\n \n(\n356,587\n)\n13.07\n \nNonvested at December 31\n7,180,206\n \n$\n15.52\n \nNOTE 7: \nPREFERRED STOCK\nPG&E Corporation\nPG&E Corporation has authorized \n400\n million shares of preferred stock.\nOn December 5, 2024, PG&E Corporation issued \n32,200,000\n shares of \n6.000\n% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, at $\n50.00\n per share, for cash proceeds of approximately $\n1.6\n billion.  The proceeds from this issuance are intended to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, to fund its \nfive-year\n capital investment plan.\nEach share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert on December 1, 2027.  The number of shares of common stock issuable on conversion of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will not be more than \n2.4331\n shares of common stock and not less than \n1.9465\n shares of common stock. \nOther than during a Fundamental Change Conversion Period (as defined in the PG&E Corporation Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation), at any time prior to December 1, 2027, holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have the option to elect to convert their shares of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part (but in no event in increments of less than one share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock), into shares of common stock at the Minimum Conversion Rate of \n1.9465\n shares of common stock per share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment as described in the Preferred Stock Preliminary Prospectus Supplement.\nDividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are cumulative.  All shares of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have voting rights and an equal preference in dividend and liquidation rights.  Upon liquidation or dissolution of the Utility, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock would be entitled to the par value of such shares plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends, as specified for the class and series.  The expected dividend payable on the first dividend payment date is approximately $\n0.7167\n per share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.  Each subsequent dividend is expected to be $\n0.75\n per share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.  The dividends will be declared on the February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 immediately preceding the relevant dividend payment date.  \nThe Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to PG&E Corporation’s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends. Accordingly, unless accumulated dividends have been paid on all of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock through the most recently completed dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on PG&E Corporation’s common stock and PG&E Corporation will not be permitted to repurchase any of its common stock, subject to limited exceptions.\n128\nOn December 12, 2024, the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation declared a cash dividend in the amount of $\n0.7167\n per mandatory convertible preferred share for the period from and including December 5, 2024 to and excluding March 1, 2025, to be payable on March 1, 2025, to holders of record as of February 14, 2025.\nUtility\nThe Utility has authorized \n75\n million shares of first preferred stock, with a par value of $\n25\n per share, and \n10\n million shares of $\n100\n first preferred stock, with a par value of $\n100\n per share.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Utility’s preferred stock outstanding included $\n145\n million of shares with interest rates between \n5\n% and \n6\n% designated as nonredeemable preferred stock and $\n113\n million of shares with interest rates between \n4.36\n% and \n5\n% that are redeemable between $\n25.75\n and $\n27.25\n per share, respectively.  The Utility’s preferred stock outstanding are not subject to mandatory redemption.  \nNo\n shares of $\n100\n first preferred stock are outstanding.\nAt December 31, 2024, annual dividends on the Utility’s nonredeemable preferred stock ranged from $\n1.25\n to $\n1.50\n per share.  The Utility’s redeemable preferred stock is subject to redemption at the Utility’s option, in whole or in part, if the Utility pays the specified redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends through the redemption date.  At December 31, 2024, annual dividends on the Utility’s redeemable preferred stock ranged from $\n1.09\n to $\n1.25\n per share.\nDividends on all Utility preferred stock are cumulative.  All shares of preferred stock have voting rights and an equal preference in dividend and liquidation rights.  Upon liquidation or dissolution of the Utility, holders of preferred stock would be entitled to the par value of such shares plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends, as specified for the class and series.  The Utility paid $\n14\n million of dividends on preferred stock in 2024.  The Utility paid approximately $\n70\n million of dividends on preferred stock in 2022, of which approximately $\n59\n million was paid in arrears.  On each of February 13, May 16, and September 19, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared dividends on its outstanding series of preferred stock totaling $\n3.5\n million, which were paid on May 15, August 15, and November 15, 2024, respectively, to holders of record as of April 30, July 31, and October 31, 2024.  On November 29, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared dividends on its outstanding series of preferred stock totaling $\n3.5\n million, payable on February 15, 2025, to holders of record as of January 31, 2025.\n \nNOTE 8: \nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nPG&E Corporation’s basic EPS is calculated by dividing the income (loss) available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  PG&E Corporation applies the treasury stock method of reflecting the dilutive effect of outstanding share-based compensation in the calculation of diluted EPS.\n  \nThe following is a reconciliation of PG&E Corporation’s income (loss) available for common shareholders and weighted average common shares outstanding for calculating diluted EPS for 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome (loss) available for common shareholders\n$\n2,475\n \n$\n2,242\n \n$\n1,800\n \nWeighted average common shares outstanding, basic \n(1)\n2,141\n \n2,064\n \n1,987\n \nAdd incremental shares from assumed conversions:\nEmployee share-based compensation\n6\n \n6\n \n8\n \nEquity Units\n—\n \n68\n \n137\n \nWeighted average common shares outstanding, diluted\n2,147\n \n2,138\n \n2,132\n \nTotal earnings (loss) per common share, diluted\n$\n1.15\n \n$\n1.05\n \n$\n0.84\n \n(1) \nExcludes \n477,743,590\n shares of PG&E Corporation common stock held by the Utility.\nFor each of the periods presented above, the calculation of outstanding common shares on a diluted basis excluded an insignificant number of options and securities that were antidilutive.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, the calculation of outstanding common shares on a diluted basis excluded the impacts of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (see Note 7 above), which were antidilutive.  In addition, as a result of an irrevocable election made on December 8, 2023 to fix the settlement method to combination settlement, the Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 4) did not have a material impact on the calculation of diluted EPS.\n129\nNOTE 9: \nINCOME TAXES\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The income tax provision includes current and deferred income taxes resulting from operations during the year.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility estimate current period tax expense in addition to calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary tax and accounting timing differences, such as those arising from depreciation expense.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  As such, the difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in future periods and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to this guidance in the financial statements represents an unrecognized tax benefit.\nInvestment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over time.  PG&E Corporation amortizes its investment tax credits over the projected investment recovery period.  The Utility amortizes its investment tax credits over the life of the related property in accordance with regulatory treatment.\nPG&E Corporation files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes the Utility and domestic subsidiaries in which its ownership is 80% or more.  PG&E Corporation files a combined state income tax return in California.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are parties to a tax-sharing agreement under which the Utility determines its income tax provision (benefit) on a stand-alone basis.\nThe significant components of income tax benefit by taxing jurisdiction were as follows:\n \nPG&E Corporation\nUtility\n \nYear\n

period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities.  Therefore, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s effective tax rates are impacted as these differences arise and reverse.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recognize such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that these amounts will be recovered from or returned to customers in future rates.  In 2024, 2023, and 2022, the amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of the TCJA passed in December 2017.  In addition, for the 2024 tax year, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will implement the accounting method change related to gas repairs in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2013-15.\n131\n(3) \nIncludes an adjustment for the tax benefit of the sale of shares by the Fire Victim Trust in 2023 and 2022 and a deferred tax asset write-off associated with the grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust in 2021.\n(4)\n These amounts primarily represent the impact of tax audit settlements and non-tax deductible penalty costs.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe following table reconciles the changes in unrecognized tax benefits:\n \nPG&E Corporation\nUtility\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n616\n \n$\n570\n \n$\n498\n \n$\n616\n \n$\n570\n \n$\n498\n \nAdditions for tax position taken during a prior year\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \nReductions for tax position taken during a prior year\n(\n257\n)\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n257\n)\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nAdditions for tax position taken during the current year\n95\n \n45\n \n73\n \n95\n \n45\n \n73\n \nSettlements\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nBalance\n \nat end of year\n$\n454\n \n$\n616\n \n$\n570\n \n$\n454\n \n$\n616\n \n$\n570\n \nThe component of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate at December 31, 2024 for PG&E Corporation and the Utility was $\n106\n million.\nPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s unrecognized tax benefits may change significantly within the next 12 months based on tax audit progress.\nInterest income, interest expense and penalties associated with income taxes are reflected in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, these amounts were immaterial.\nTax Audits\nPG&E Corporation’s tax returns have been accepted through 2015 for federal income tax purposes. The IRS is auditing PG&E Corporation’s tax returns for 2015 through 2018. The most significant unresolved matter relates to the deductibility of approximately $\n850\n million in costs for San Bruno related safety spend, which the CPUC did not allow the Utility to recover through rates, and $\n400\n million in customer bill credits.  PG&E Corporation records an income tax benefit related to a deduction for an uncertain tax position when it determines it is more likely than not that the uncertain tax position will ultimately be sustained.  On June 4, 2024, the Office of Chief Counsel of the IRS issued a technical advice memorandum taking the position that the costs the Utility incurred for San Bruno related to safety spend and customer bill credits are nondeductible fines or penalties.  As a result, in the year ended December 31, 2024, PG&E Corporation determined that it is no longer more likely than not that its deduction related to a portion of the customer bill credits would ultimately be sustained.  Accordingly, PG&E Corporation has decreased its Income tax benefit by $\n70\n million in the year ended December 31, 2024 related to state and federal income taxes.  PG&E Corporation intends to defend itself vigorously as to all costs in this matter.\nCarryforwards\nThe following table describes PG&E Corporation’s operating loss and tax credit carryforward balances:\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nExpiration\nYear\nFederal:\n \n \nNet operating loss carryforward - Pre-2018\n$\n3,369\n \n2031 - 2036\nNet operating loss carryforward - Post-2017\n30,288\n \nN/A\nTax credit carryforward\n125\n \n2029 - 2041\nState:\nNet operating loss carryforward\n$\n34,901\n \n2039 - 2041\nTax credit carryforward\n146\n \nVarious\n132\nPG&E Corporation does not believe that the Chapter 11 Cases resulted in loss of or limitation on the utilization of any of the tax carryforwards.\n \nPG&E Corporation will continue to monitor the status of tax carryforwards.\nNOTE 10: \nDERIVATIVES\nUse of Derivative Instruments\nThe Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities.  Procurement costs are recovered through rates.  The Utility uses both derivative and non-derivative contracts to manage volatility in customer rates due to fluctuating commodity prices.  Derivatives include contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.\nDerivatives are presented in the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded at fair value and on a net basis in accordance with master netting arrangements for each counterparty.  The fair value of derivative instruments is further offset by cash collateral paid or received where the right of offset and the intention to offset exist.\nPrice risk management activities that meet the definition of derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These instruments are not held for speculative purposes and are subject to certain regulatory requirements.  The Utility expects to fully recover through rates all costs related to derivatives under the applicable ratemaking mechanism in place as long as the Utility’s price risk management activities are carried out in accordance with CPUC directives.  Therefore, all unrealized gains and losses associated with the change in fair value of these derivatives are deferred and recorded within the Utility’s \nregulatory assets\n and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Net realized gains or losses on commodity derivatives are recorded in the Cost of electricity or the Cost of natural gas with corresponding increases or decreases to regulatory balancing accounts for recovery from or refund to customers.\nThe Utility elects the normal purchase and sale exception for eligible derivatives.  Eligible derivatives are those that require physical delivery in quantities that are expected to be used by the Utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business and do not contain pricing provisions unrelated to the commodity delivered.  These items are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.\nVolume of Derivative Activity\nThe volumes of the Utility’s outstanding derivatives were as follows:\n \n \nContract Volume at\nUnderlying Product\nInstruments\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nNatural Gas \n(1)\n (MMBtus \n(2)\n)\nForwards, futures, and swaps\n179,257,247\n \n196,063,296\n \n \nOptions\n37,717,500\n \n30,695,000\n \nElectricity (MWh)\nForwards, futures, and swaps\n8,576,078\n \n9,169,967\n \nOptions\n1,663,200\n \n92,400\n \n \nCongestion Revenue Rights \n(3)\n123,040,895\n \n170,465,674\n \n(1) \nAmounts shown are for the combined positions of the electric fuels and core gas supply portfolios.\n(2)\n Million British Thermal Units.\n(3)\n CRRs are financial instruments that enable the holders to manage variability in electric energy congestion charges due to transmission grid limitations.\n133\nPresentation of Derivative Instruments in the Financial Statements\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Utility’s outstanding derivative balances were as follows:\n \nCommodity Risk\n(in millions)\nGross Derivative\nBalance\nNetting\nCash Collateral\nTotal Derivative\nBalance\nCurrent assets – other\n$\n186\n \n$\n(\n16\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n170\n \nNoncurrent assets – other\n233\n \n—\n \n—\n \n233\n \nCurrent liabilities – other\n(\n152\n)\n16\n \n—\n \n(\n136\n)\nNoncurrent liabilities – other\n(\n167\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n167\n)\nTotal commodity risk\n$\n100\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n100\n \nAs of December 31, 2023, the Utility’s outstanding derivative balances were as follows:\n \nCommodity Risk\n(in millions)\nGross Derivative\nBalance\nNetting\nCash Collateral\nTotal Derivative\nBalance\nCurrent assets – other\n$\n134\n \n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n50\n \n$\n176\n \nOther noncurrent assets – other\n280\n \n—\n \n—\n \n280\n \nCurrent liabilities – other\n(\n172\n)\n8\n \n46\n \n(\n118\n)\nNoncurrent liabilities – other\n(\n160\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n160\n)\nTotal commodity risk\n$\n82\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n96\n \n$\n178\n \nCash inflows and outflows associated with derivatives are included in operating cash flows on the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nSome of the Utility’s derivative instruments, including power purchase agreements, contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies, also known as a credit-risk-related contingent feature.  Multiple credit agencies continue to rate the Utility below investment grade, which results in the Utility posting additional collateral.  As of December 31, 2024, the Utility satisfied or has otherwise addressed its obligations related to the credit-risk related contingency features.\nNOTE 11: \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility measure their cash equivalents, trust assets, and price risk management instruments at fair value.  A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\n•\nLevel 1 –\n Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2 –\n Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\n•\nLevel 3 –\n Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\n134\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring

used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the tables above.  There are no restrictions on the terms and conditions upon which the investments may be redeemed.  There were no material transfers between any levels for the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n136\nTrust Assets\nAssets Measured at Fair Value\nIn general, investments held in the trusts are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and market volatility risks.  Nuclear decommissioning trust assets, customer credit trust assets and other trust assets are composed primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and also include short-term investments that are money market funds classified as Level 1.\nGlobal equity securities primarily include investments in common stock that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.\nFixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including corporate debt securities.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value is determined by observable market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of fixed-income securities classified as Level 2 using evaluated pricing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation model generally include benchmark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation model, as applicable.\nAssets Measured at NAV Using Practical Expedient\nInvestments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and the long-term disability trust that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges as well as fixed-income securities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities, credit securities, and asset-backed securities.\nPacific Energy Risk Solutions, LLC\nInvestments held in Pacific Energy Risk Solutions, LLC primarily include short-term investments that are U.S. government securities classified as Level 1.\nPrice Risk Management Instruments\nPrice risk management instruments include physical and financial derivative contracts, such as power purchase agreements, forwards, futures, swaps, options, and CRRs that are traded either on an exchange or over-the-counter.\nPower purchase agreements, forwards, and swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow model.  Exchange-traded futures that are valued using observable market forward prices for the underlying commodity are classified as Level 1.  Over-the-counter forwards and swaps that are identical to exchange-traded futures or are valued using forward prices from broker quotes that are corroborated with market data are classified as Level 2.  Exchange-traded options are valued using observable market data and market-corroborated data and are classified as Level 2.\nLong-dated power purchase agreements that are valued using significant unobservable data are classified as Level 3.  These Level 3 contracts are valued using either estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points or techniques, including extrapolation from observable prices, when a contract term extends beyond a period for which market data is available.  The Utility utilizes models to derive pricing inputs for the valuation of the Utility’s Level 3 instruments using pricing inputs from brokers and historical data.\nThe Utility holds CRRs to hedge the financial risk of CAISO-imposed congestion charges in the day-ahead market.  Limited market data is available in the CAISO auction and between auction dates; therefore, the Utility utilizes historical prices to forecast forward prices.  CRRs are classified as Level 3.\nLevel 3 Measurements and Uncertainty Analysis\nInputs used and the fair value of Level 3 instruments are reviewed period-over-period and compared with market conditions to determine reasonableness.\n137\nSignificant increases or decreases in any of those inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value, respectively.  All reasonable costs related to Level 3 instruments are expected to be recoverable through rates; therefore, there is no impact on net income resulting from changes in the fair value of these instruments.  See Note 10 above.\n \nFair Value\n \n \n \n(in millions)\nAt December 31, 2024\nValuation\nTechnique\nUnobservable\nInput\n \nFair Value Measurement\nAssets\nLiabilities\n \nRange \n(1)\n/Weighted-Average Price\n \n(2) \nCongestion revenue rights\n$\n366\n \n$\n121\n \nMarket approach\nCRR auction prices\n$ (\n951\n) - \n50,044\n / \n2\nPower purchase agreements\n$\n17\n \n$\n127\n \nDiscounted cash flow\nForward prices\n$ \n0\n - \n126\n / \n47\n(1) \nRepresents price per MWh.\n(2) \nUnobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instruments.\n \nFair Value\n \n \n \n(in millions)\nAt December 31, 2023\nValuation\nTechnique\nUnobservable\nInput\n \nFair Value Measurement\nAssets\nLiabilities\n \nRange \n(1)\n/Weighted-Average Price\n \n(2) \nCongestion revenue rights\n$\n357\n \n$\n134\n \nMarket approach\nCRR auction prices\n$ (\n924\n) - \n16,697\n / \n1\nPower purchase agreements\n$\n47\n \n$\n79\n \nDiscounted cash flow\nForward prices\n$ \n1\n - \n190\n / \n60\n(1) \nRepresents price per MWh.\n(2) \nUnobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instruments.\nLevel 3 Reconciliation\nThe following table presents the reconciliation for Level 3 price risk management instruments for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\n \nPrice Risk Management Instruments\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nAsset balance as of January 1\n$\n191\n \n$\n199\n \nNet realized and unrealized gains (losses):\nIncluded in regulatory assets and liabilities or balancing accounts\n (1)\n(\n64\n)\n(\n8\n)\nAsset balance as of December 31\n$\n127\n \n$\n191\n \n(1)\n The costs related to price risk management activities are recovered through rates.  Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses are deferred in regulatory liabilities and assets and net income is not impacted.\nFinancial Instruments\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility use the following

defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees hired before December 31, 2012 and a cash balance plan for those eligible employees hired after this date or who made a one-time election to participate (“Pension Plan”).  Certain trusts underlying these plans are qualified trusts under the IRC.  If certain conditions are met, PG&E Corporation and the Utility can deduct payments made to the qualified trusts, subject to certain limitations.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy is to contribute tax-deductible amounts, consistent with applicable regulatory decisions and federal minimum funding requirements.  On an annual basis, the Utility funds the pension plan up to the amount it is authorized to recover through rates.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility also sponsor contributory postretirement medical plans for retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility use a fiscal year-end measurement date for all plans.\n140\nChange in Plan Assets, Benefit Obligations, and Funded Status \nThe following tables show the reconciliation of changes in

The projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for the postretirement life insurance plan were $\n261\n million and $\n296\n million as of December 31, 2024, and $\n275\n million and $\n292\n million as of December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThere was no material difference between PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the information disclosed above.\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Cost\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan and cash balance plan.  Both plans are included in “Pension Plan” below.  Post-retirement medical and life insurance plans are included in “Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions” below.\n142\nNet periodic benefit costs as reflected in PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Income were as follows: \nPension Plan\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nService cost for benefits earned\n (1)\n$\n396\n \n$\n379\n \n$\n575\n \nInterest cost\n916\n \n913\n \n692\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n1,014\n)\n(\n981\n)\n(\n1,189\n)\nAmortization of prior service cost\n(\n3\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\nAmortization of net actuarial loss\n1\n \n1\n \n2\n \nNet periodic benefit cost\n296\n \n308\n \n76\n \nLess: transfer to regulatory account\n (2)\n39\n \n25\n \n254\n \nTotal expense recognized\n$\n335\n \n$\n333\n \n$\n330\n \n(1)\n A portion of service costs are capitalized pursuant to ASC 715.\n(2)\n The Utility recorded these amounts to a regulatory account as they are probable of recovery through future rates.\nPostretirement Benefits Other than Pensions\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nService cost for benefits earned\n (1)\n$\n41\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n62\n \nInterest cost\n71\n \n73\n \n53\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n139\n)\n(\n132\n)\n(\n130\n)\nAmortization of prior service cost\n3\n \n3\n \n7\n \nAmortization of net actuarial gain\n(\n23\n)\n(\n19\n)\n(\n40\n)\nSpecial termination benefits\n—\n \n—\n \n22\n \nNet periodic benefit cost\n$\n(\n47\n)\n$\n(\n37\n)\n$\n(\n26\n)\n(1)\n A portion of service costs are capitalized pursuant to ASC 715.\nNon-service costs are reflected in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Service costs are reflected in Operating and maintenance on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThere was no material difference between PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the information disclosed above.\nComponents of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility record unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses related to pension and post-retirement benefits other than pension as components of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.  In addition, regulatory adjustments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the difference between expense or income calculated in accordance with GAAP for accounting purposes and expense or income for ratemaking purposes, which is based on authorized plan contributions.  For pension benefits, a regulatory asset or liability is recorded for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income.  For post-retirement benefits other than pension, the Utility generally records a regulatory liability for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income.  As the Utility is unable to record a regulatory asset for these other benefits, the charge remains in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n143\nValuation Assumptions\nThe following weighted average year-end actuarial assumptions were used in determining the plans’ projected benefit obligations and net benefit costs.\n \nPension Plan\nPBOP Plans\n \nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n5.76\n \n%\n5.21\n \n%\n5.54\n \n%\n5.71\n - \n5.76\n%\n5.18\n - \n5.22\n%\n5.50\n - \n5.54\n%\nRate of future compensation increases\n4.80\n \n%\n3.80\n \n%\n3.80\n \n%\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nExpected return on plan assets\n6.40\n \n%\n6.00\n \n%\n6.10\n \n%\n3.90\n - \n7.20\n%\n3.70\n - \n7.00\n%\n3.70\n - \n7.30\n%\nInterest crediting rate for cash balance plan\n4.41\n \n%\n3.86\n \n%\n4.19\n \n%\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nThe assumed health care cost trend rate as of December 31, 2024 was \n7.50\n%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of approximately \n4.5\n% in 2033 and beyond.\nExpected rates of return on plan assets were developed by estimating future asset class returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations of the employee benefit plan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets.  Returns on fixed-income debt investments were projected based on maturity and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate.  Returns on equity investments were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term inflation rate.  For the pension plan, the assumed return of \n6.4\n% compares to a ten-year actual return of \n5.1\n%.  The rate used to discount pension benefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of over approximately \n858\n Aa-grade non-callable bonds at December 31, 2024.  This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations.  The estimated future cash flows for the pension benefits and other benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.\nInvestment Policies and Strategies\nThe financial position of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations.  Volatility in funded status occurs when asset values change differently from liability values and can result in fluctuations in costs in financial reporting, as well as the amount of minimum contributions required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investment policies and strategies are designed to increase the ratio of trust assets to plan liabilities at an acceptable level of funded status volatility.\nThe trusts’ asset allocations are meant to manage volatility, reduce costs, and diversify its holdings.  Interest rate, credit, and equity risk are the key determinants of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funded status volatility.  In addition to affecting the trusts’ fixed income portfolio market values, interest rate changes also influence liability valuations as discount rates move with current bond yields.  To manage volatility, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s trusts hold significant allocations in long maturity fixed-income investments.  Although they contribute to funded status volatility, equity investments are held to reduce long-term funding costs due to their higher expected return.  Real assets and absolute return investments are held to diversify the trust’s holdings in equity and fixed-income investments by exhibiting returns with low correlation to the direction of these markets.  Real assets include global real estate investment trusts (“REITS”), global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  Absolute return investments include hedge fund portfolios.\nDerivative instruments such as equity index futures are used to meet target equity exposure.  Derivative instruments, such as equity index futures and U.S. treasury futures, are also used to rebalance the allocation between fixed income and equity of the pension’s portfolio.  Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion of the non-U.S. dollar exposure of global equity investments.\n144\nThe target asset allocation percentages for major categories of trust assets for pension and other benefit plans are as follows: \n \nPension Plan\nPBOP Plans\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\n2025\n2024\n2023\nGlobal equity securities\n26\n \n%\n26\n \n%\n26\n \n%\n30\n \n%\n29\n \n%\n28\n \n%\nAbsolute return\n1\n \n%\n1\n \n%\n1\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n1\n \n%\nReal assets\n8\n \n%\n8\n \n%\n8\n \n%\n3\n \n%\n3\n \n%\n3\n \n%\nFixed-income securities\n65\n \n%\n65\n \n%\n65\n \n%\n67\n \n%\n68\n \n%\n68\n \n%\nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility apply a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets.  The guiding principles of this risk management framework are the clear articulation of roles and responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper accountability and documentation.  Trust investment policies and investment manager guidelines include provisions designed to ensure prudent diversification, manage risk through appropriate use of physical direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited investments.\nFair Value Measurements \nThe following tables present the fair value of plan assets for pension and other benefits plans by major asset category at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \nFair Value Measurements\n \nAt December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nPension Plan:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShort-term investments\n$\n126\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n173\n \n$\n565\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n651\n \nGlobal equity securities\n1,310\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,310\n \n1,270\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,270\n \nReal assets\n437\n \n—\n \n—\n \n437\n \n472\n \n—\n \n—\n \n472\n \nFixed-income securities\n2,180\n \n6,367\n \n16\n \n8,563\n \n1,926\n \n6,802\n \n13\n \n8,741\n \nAssets measured at NAV\n— \n— \n— \n6,284\n \n— \n— \n— \n6,080\n \nTotal\n$\n4,053\n \n$\n6,414\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n16,767\n \n$\n4,233\n \n$\n6,888\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n17,214\n \nPBOP Plans:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShort-term investments\n$\n27\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n30\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n30\n \nGlobal equity securities\n60\n \n—\n \n—\n \n60\n \n66\n \n—\n \n—\n \n66\n \nReal assets\n20\n \n—\n \n—\n \n20\n \n32\n \n—\n \n—\n \n32\n \nFixed-income securities\n431\n \n751\n \n1\n \n1,183\n \n422\n \n795\n \n1\n \n1,218\n \nAssets measured at NAV\n— \n— \n— \n1,181\n \n— \n— \n— \n1,160\n \nTotal\n$\n538\n \n$\n751\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2,471\n \n$\n550\n \n$\n795\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2,506\n \nTotal plan assets at fair value\n \n \n \n$\n19,238\n \n \n \n \n$\n19,720\n \nIn addition to the total plan assets disclosed at fair value in the table above, the trusts had other net liabilities of \nzero\n and $\n10\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, comprised primarily of cash, accounts receivable, deferred taxes, and accounts payable.\nValuation Techniques\nThe following describes the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities shown in the table above.  All investments that are valued using a NAV per share can be redeemed quarterly with a notice not to exceed 90 days.\nShort-Term Investments\nShort-term investments consist primarily of commingled funds across government, credit, and asset-backed sectors.  These securities are categorized as Level 1 and Level 2 assets.\n145\nGlobal Equity Securities\nThe global equity category includes investments in common stock and equity-index futures.  Equity investments in common stock are actively traded on public exchanges and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.  These equity investments are generally valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets for identical securities.  Equity-index futures are valued based on unadjusted prices in active markets and are Level 1 assets.\nReal Assets\nThe real asset category includes portfolios of commodity futures, global REITS, global listed infrastructure equities, and private real estate funds.  The commodity futures, global REITS, and global listed infrastructure equities are actively traded on a public exchange and are therefore considered Level 1 assets.\nFixed-Income Securities\nFixed-income securities are primarily composed of U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, and other fixed-income securities, including corporate debt securities.  U.S. government and agency securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities that are classified as Level 1 because the fair value is determined by observable market prices in active markets.  A market approach is generally used to estimate the fair value of debt securities classified as Level 2 using evaluated pricing data such as broker quotes, for similar securities adjusted for observable differences.  Significant inputs used in the valuation model generally include benchmark yield curves and issuer spreads.  The external credit ratings, coupon rate, and maturity of each security are considered in the valuation model, as applicable.\nAssets Measured at NAV Using Practical Expedient\nInvestments in the trusts that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy tables above.  The fair value amounts are included in the tables above in order to reconcile to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These investments include commingled funds that are composed of equity securities traded publicly on exchanges, fixed-income securities that are composed primarily of U.S. government securities, credit securities and asset-backed securities, and real assets and absolute return investments that are held to diversify the trust’s holdings in equity and fixed-income securities.\nTransfers Between Levels\nNo material transfers between levels occurred in the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n146\nLevel 3 Reconciliation\nThe following table is a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of instruments for the pension plan that have been classified as Level 3 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n(in millions)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\nFixed-Income\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n13\n \nActual return on plan assets:\nRelating to assets still held at the reporting date\n9\n \nRelating to assets sold during the period\n(\n9\n)\nPurchases, issuances, sales, and settlements:\nPurchases\n14\n \nSettlements\n(\n11\n)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n16\n \n \n \n(in millions)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\nFixed-Income\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n8\n \nActual return on plan assets:\n  Relating to assets still held at the reporting date\n2\n \nRelating to assets sold during the period\n(\n1\n)\nPurchases, issuances, sales, and settlements:\nPurchases\n10\n \nSettlements\n(\n6\n)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n13\n \nThere were no material transfers out of Level 3 in 2024 or 2023.\nCash Flow Information \nEmployer Contributions\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility contributed $\n337\n million to the pension benefit plans, $\n31\n million to the long-term disability trusts, and $\n5\n million to the other postretirement benefit plans in 2024.  These contributions are consistent with PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s funding policy, which is to contribute amounts that are tax-deductible and consistent with applicable regulatory decisions and federal minimum funding requirements. The Utility’s pension benefits met all funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to make total contributions of approximately $\n327\n million to the pension plan in 2025.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility plan to contribute $\n31\n million to the long-term disability trusts in 2025, as authorized in the 2023 GRC.\nBenefits Payments and Receipts\nAs of December 31, 2024, the estimated benefits expected to be paid and the estimated federal subsidies expected to be received in each of the next five fiscal years, and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:\n(in millions)\nPension\nPlan\nPBOP\nPlans\nFederal\nSubsidy\n2025\n969\n \n81\n \n(\n1\n)\n2026\n1,055\n \n84\n \n(\n1\n)\n2027\n1,083\n \n87\n \n(\n2\n)\n2028\n1,109\n \n89\n \n(\n2\n)\n2029\n1,133\n \n91\n \n(\n2\n)\n2030-2034\n5,997\n \n473\n \n(\n11\n)\n147\nThere were no material differences between the estimated benefits expected to be paid by PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the years presented above.  There were also no material differences between the estimated subsidies expected to be received by PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the years presented above.\nRetirement Savings Plan\nPG&E Corporation sponsors a retirement savings plan, which qualifies as a 401(k) defined contribution benefit plan under the IRC.  This plan permits eligible employees to make pre-tax and after-tax contributions into the plan and provides for employer contributions to be made to eligible participants.  Total expenses recognized for defined contribution benefit plans reflected in PG&E Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Income were $\n175\n million, $\n158\n million, and $\n144\n million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  PG&E Corporation’s default matching contributions under its 401(k) plan are in cash.  \nThere were no material differences between the employer contribution expense for PG&E Corporation and the Utility for the years presented above.\nNOTE 13: \nRELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS\nThe Utility and other subsidiaries provide and receive various services to and from their parent, PG&E Corporation, and among themselves.  The Utility and PG&E Corporation exchange administrative and professional services in support of operations.  Services provided directly to PG&E Corporation by the Utility are priced at the higher of fully loaded cost (i.e., direct cost of good or service and allocation of overhead costs) or fair market value, depending on the nature of the services.  Services provided directly to the Utility by PG&E Corporation are generally priced at the lower of fully loaded cost or fair market value, depending on the nature and value of the services.  PG&E Corporation also allocates various corporate administrative and general costs to the Utility and other subsidiaries using agreed-upon allocation factors, including the number of employees, operating and maintenance expenses, total assets, and other cost allocation methodologies.  Management believes that the methods used to allocate expenses are reasonable and meet the reporting and accounting requirements of its regulatory agencies.\nThe Utility’s significant related party transactions were:\n \nYear Ended December 31, \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUtility revenues from:\n \n \n \nAdministrative services provided to PG&E Corporation\n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \nUtility expenses from:\nAdministrative services received from PG&E Corporation\n$\n66\n \n$\n80\n \n$\n104\n \nUtility employee benefit due to PG&E Corporation\n81\n \n74\n \n85\n \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Utility had receivables of $\n25\n million and $\n26\n million, respectively, from PG&E Corporation included in Accounts receivable – other and Noncurrent assets – other on the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and payables of $\n11\n million and $\n24\n million, respectively, to PG&E Corporation included in Accounts payable – other on the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNOTE 14: \nWILDFIRE-RELATED CONTINGENCIES\nLiability Overview\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a provision for a loss contingency when they determine that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate which potential liabilities are probable and the related range of reasonably estimated losses and record a charge that reflects their best estimate or the lower end of the range, if there is no better estimate.\n148\nAssessing whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, whether the loss or a range of losses is estimable, and the amount of the best estimate or lower end of the range often requires management to exercise significant judgment about future events.  Management makes these assessments based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors, including negotiations (including those during mediations with claimants), discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter, and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires.  Unless expressly noted otherwise, the loss accruals in this Note reflect the lower end of the range of the reasonably estimable range of losses.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss could be greater than the accrued estimated amounts but are unable to reasonably estimate the additional loss or the upper end of the range because, as described below, there are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PG&E Corporation and the Utility.\nLoss contingencies are reviewed quarterly, and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information.  As more information becomes available, including from potential claimants as litigation or resolution efforts progress, management estimates and assumptions regarding the potential financial impacts of wildfire events may change.  For instance, PG&E Corporation and the Utility receive additional information with respect to damages claimed as the claims mediation and trial processes progress.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated outside counsel costs, which are expensed as incurred.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the outcome of the following matters.\nPotential liabilities related to wildfires depend on various factors, including the cause of the fire, contributing causes of the fire (including alternative potential origins, weather- and climate-related issues, and forest management and fire suppression practices), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, the contents of such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants, the nature and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damages the Utility may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties, fines, or restitution that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of numerous civil complaints related to the following wildfire events and expect that they may receive further complaints, except that the applicable statutes of limitations have run for the 2019 Kincade and 2021 Dixie fires.  The complaints include claims based on multiple theories of liability, including inverse condemnation, negligence, violations of the Public Utilities Code, violations of the Health & Safety Code, premises liability, trespass, public nuisance, and private nuisance.  The plaintiffs in each action principally assert that PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s alleged failure to properly maintain, inspect, and de-energize their power lines was the cause of the relevant wildfire.  The timing and outcome for resolution of any such claims or investigations are uncertain.  The Utility believes it will continue to receive additional information from potential claimants in connection with these wildfire events as litigation or resolution efforts progress.  Any such additional information may potentially allow PG&E Corporation and the Utility to refine the estimates of their accrued losses and may result in changes to the accrual depending on the information received.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to vigorously defend themselves against both criminal charges and civil complaints.\nIf the Utility’s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are judicially determined to be the substantial cause of the following matters, and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys’ fees without having been found negligent.  California courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefited from such undertaking, and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs through rates.  Further, California courts have determined that the doctrine of inverse condemnation is applicable regardless of whether the CPUC ultimately allows recovery by the utility for any such costs.  The CPUC may decide not to authorize cost recovery even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation.  In addition to claims for property damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys’ fees under inverse condemnation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, punitive damages and other damages under other theories of liability in connection with the following wildfire events, including if PG&E Corporation or the Utility were found to have been negligent.\n149\nIf the liability for wildfires were to exceed $1.0 billion in the aggregate in any Coverage Year, the Utility may be eligible to make a claim to the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 to satisfy settled or finally adjudicated eligible claims in excess of such amount, except that claims related to the 2019 Kincade fire would be subject to the 40% limitation on the allowed amount of claims arising before emergence from bankruptcy.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to continue to review the available information and other information as it becomes available, including evidence in the possession of Cal Fire, USFS, or the relevant district attorney’s office, evidence from or held by other parties, claims that have not yet been submitted, and additional information about the nature and extent of personal and business property damages and losses, the nature, number and severity of personal injuries, and information made available through the discovery process.\nThe following table presents the cumulative amounts PG&E Corporation and the Utility have paid through December 31, 2024.\nPayments (in millions)\n2019 Kincade Fire\n$\n958\n \n2021 Dixie Fire\n1,359\n \n2022 Mosquito Fire\n18\n \nTotal at December 31, 2024\n$\n2,335\n \n2019 Kincade Fire\nAccording to Cal Fire, on October 23, 2019 at approximately 9:27 p.m. Pacific Time, a wildfire began northeast of Geyserville in Sonoma County, California (the “2019 Kincade fire”), located in the service area of the Utility.  According to a Cal Fire incident update dated March 3, 2020, 3:35 p.m. Pacific Time, the 2019 Kincade fire consumed \n77,758\n acres and resulted in \nno\n fatalities, \nfour\n first responder injuries, \n374\n structures destroyed, and \n60\n structures damaged.  In connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, state and local officials issued numerous mandatory evacuation orders and evacuation warnings.  Based on County of Sonoma information, PG&E Corporation and the Utility understand that the geographic zones subject to either a mandatory evacuation order or an evacuation warning between October 23, 2019 and November 4, 2019 included approximately \n200,000\n persons.\nOn July 16, 2020, Cal Fire issued a press release with its determination that the Utility’s equipment caused the 2019 Kincade fire.\nAs of February 5, 2025, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately \n133\n complaints on behalf of at least \n2,960\n plaintiffs related to the 2019 Kincade fire.  The plaintiffs filed master complaints on July 16, 2021; PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s response was filed on August 16, 2021; and PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a demurrer with respect to the plaintiffs’ inverse condemnation claims.  On December 10, 2021, the court overruled the demurrer.  On July 20, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed a motion for summary adjudication on individual plaintiffs’ claims for punitive damages.  On July 14, 2024 the court vacated the bellwether trial date that had been scheduled for August 26, 2024, as well as the hearing on the motion for summary adjudication.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility are also aware of a complaint on behalf of Geysers Power Company, Calpine Corporation, and CPN Insurance Corporation.  The court scheduled a trial on their claims for August 4, 2025.  The parties have reached settlements in principle for these claims and expect that the trial date will be vacated.\nOn October 11, 2022, the Utility entered into a tolling agreement with the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (“Cal OES”), extending their time to file a complaint.\nBased on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $\n1.125\n billion as of December 31, 2023 (before available insurance).  Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including their experience with settlements, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded additional charges during 2024 of $\n100\n million, of which $\n75\n million was recorded in the third quarter and $\n25\n million was recorded in the fourth quarter, for an aggregate liability of $\n1.225\n billion (before available insurance).\n150\nPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $\n1.225\n billion do not include, among other things: (i) any punitive damages, (ii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies other than state fire suppression costs, or (iii) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable.\nThe following table presents changes in the lower end of the range of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reasonably estimable losses, net of payments, for claims arising from the 2019 Kincade fire since December 31, 2023.\nLoss Accrual (in millions)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n458\n \nAccrued Losses\n100\n \nPayments\n(\n291\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n267\n \nThe Utility has liability insurance coverage for third-party liability attributable to the 2019 Kincade fire in an aggregate amount of $\n430\n million, which was fully collected as of December 31, 2023.\n2021 Dixie Fire\nAccording to the Cal Fire Investigation Report on the 2021 Dixie fire (the “Cal Fire Investigation Report”), on July 13, 2021, at approximately 5:07 p.m. Pacific Time, a wildfire began in the Feather River Canyon near Cresta Dam (the “2021 Dixie fire”), located in the service area of the Utility.  According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, the 2021 Dixie fire consumed \n963,309\n acres and resulted in \n1,311\n structures destroyed and \n94\n structures damaged (including \n763\n residential homes, \n12\n multi-family homes, \n8\n commercial residential homes, \n148\n nonresidential commercial structures, and \n466\n detached structures), and \nfour\n first-responder injuries.  The Cal Fire Investigation Report does not attribute a fatality that was previously published in an October 25, 2021 Cal Fire incident report to the 2021 Dixie fire.\nOn January 4, 2022, Cal Fire issued a press release with its determination that the 2021 Dixie fire was caused by a tree contacting electrical distribution lines owned and operated by the Utility.  On June 7, 2022, the Utility received a copy of the Cal Fire Investigation Report, which states that the fire ignited when a tree fell and contacted electrical distribution lines owned and operated by the Utility, and the Cal Fire Investigation Report has been made publicly available.  The Cal Fire Investigation Report alleges that the Utility acted negligently in its response to the initial outage and fault that caused the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Cal Fire Investigation Report also alleges that the subject tree had visible outward signs of damage and decay which would have been noticeable at the ground level, and that a brief visual inspection should have discovered the decay.  Based on the information currently available to the Utility, through its ongoing investigation, including its inspection records, operating and inspection protocols and procedures, implementation of those protocols and procedures, and day-of-event response, the Utility believes its personnel acted reasonably (within the meaning of the applicable prudency standard discussed under “Regulatory Recovery” below) given the information available at the time and followed applicable policies and protocols both before ignition and in the day-of-event response.  While an intervenor in a future cost recovery proceeding may argue the Cal Fire Investigation Report itself creates serious doubt with respect to the reasonableness of the Utility’s conduct, PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe the report identifies sufficient facts to shift the burden of proof applicable in a proceeding for cost recovery to the Utility.  (See “Regulatory Recovery” and “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” below.)  PG&E Corporation and the Utility disagree with many allegations in the Cal Fire Investigation Report and plan to vigorously contest them.  However, if the CPUC or the FERC were to reach conclusions similar to those of the Cal Fire Investigation Report, it may determine that the Utility had been imprudent, in which case some or all of its costs recorded to the WEMA would not be recoverable, the Utility would not be able to recover costs through FERC TO rates, or the Utility would be required to reimburse the Wildfire Fund for the costs and expenses that are allocated to it.\nAs of February 5, 2025, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately \n182\n complaints on behalf of at least \n8,681\n individual plaintiffs related to the 2021 Dixie fire and expect that they may receive further complaints.  The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, property damage, economic loss, medical monitoring, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and other damages.  The court had previously scheduled two trial dates for October 14, 2024 and February 24, 2025.  The court has vacated both of those dates and set a new bellwether trial date for June 23, 2025.\nThe Collins Pine Company and a group of timber companies filed a complaint against PG&E Corporation and the Utility on April 10, 2024.\n \nPG&E Corporation and the Utility answered this complaint on May 28, 2024.\n151\nCal Fire filed a complaint against the Utility to recover suppression and investigation costs on June 30, 2023.  The Utility filed an amended answer to the complaint on September 30, 2024.  On October 10, 2024, Cal Fire filed a demurrer to portions of the amended answer.  On February 7, 2025, the court issued a ruling sustaining Cal Fire’s demurrer and striking portions of the Utility’s amended answer.\nOn February 7, 2023, the Utility entered into a tolling agreement with Cal OES, extending their time to file a complaint.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of a separate putative class complaint. On August 23, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility demurred to the putative class complaint.  On January 13, 2025, the court issued an order pursuant to which plaintiff has 30 days to amend the complaint or the case will be abated.\nBased on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including Cal Fire’s determination of the cause and the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $\n1.6\n billion as of December 31, 2023 (before available insurance).  Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including their experience with settlements, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded additional charges during 2024 of $\n325\n million, of which $\n275\n million was recorded in the third quarter and $\n50\n million was recorded in the fourth quarter, for an aggregate liability of $\n1.925\n billion (before available insurance).\nPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses of $\n1.925\n billion do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies other than Cal Fire, including for fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, (iv) class action medical monitoring costs, or (v) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable.\nAs noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs other than Cal Fire or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests.  As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2021 Dixie fire.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe, however, that such losses could be significant with respect to fire suppression costs due to the size and duration of the 2021 Dixie fire and corresponding magnitude of fire suppression resources dedicated to fighting the 2021 Dixie fire and with respect to claims for damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests due to the very large number of acres of national parks and national forests that were affected by the 2021 Dixie fire.  According to the Cal Fire Investigation Report, over $\n650\n million of costs had been incurred in suppressing the 2021 Dixie fire.  The Utility estimates that the fire burned approximately \n70,000\n acres of national parks and approximately \n685,000\n acres of national forests.\nThe following table presents changes in the lower end of the range of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reasonably estimable losses, net of payments, for claims arising from the 2021 Dixie fire since December 31, 2023.\nLoss Accrual (in millions)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n870\n \nAccrued Losses\n325\n \nPayments\n(\n628\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n567\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Utility recorded an insurance receivable of $\n527\n million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire.\n152\nThe Utility recorded an aggregate Wildfire Fund receivable of $\n925\n million for probable recoveries in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire, of which it had received $\n169\n million as of December 31, 2024.  AB 1054 provides that the CPUC may allocate costs and expenses in the application for cost recovery in full or in part taking into account factors both within and beyond the utility’s control that may have exacerbated the costs and expenses, including humidity, temperature, and winds.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that, even if it found that the Utility acted unreasonably, the CPUC would nevertheless authorize recovery in part.  See “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” below.  As of December 31, 2024, the Utility also recorded a $\n94\n million reduction to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and a $\n508\n million regulatory asset for costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the WEMA.  See “Regulatory Recovery” below.  Decreases in the amount of the insurance receivable for the 2021 Dixie fire may also increase the amount that is probable of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and the WEMA.\n2022 Mosquito Fire\nOn September 6, 2022, at approximately 6:17 p.m. Pacific Time, the Utility was notified that a wildfire had ignited near Oxbow Reservoir in Placer County, California (the “2022 Mosquito fire”), located in the service area of the Utility.  The National Wildfire Coordinating Group’s InciWeb incident overview dated November 4, 2022 at 6:30 p.m. Pacific Time indicated that the 2022 Mosquito fire had consumed approximately \n76,788\n acres at that time.  It also indicated \nno\n fatalities, \nno\n injuries, \n78\n structures destroyed, and \n13\n structures damaged (including \n44\n residential homes and \n40\n detached structures) and that the fire was \n100\n% contained.\nThe USFS has indicated to the Utility an initial assessment that the fire started in the area of the Utility’s power line on National Forest System lands and that the USFS is conducting a criminal investigation into the 2022 Mosquito fire.  On September 24, 2022, the USFS removed and took possession of one of the Utility’s transmission poles and attached equipment.  The USFS has not issued a determination as to the cause.\nThe cause of the 2022 Mosquito fire remains under investigation by the USFS, the United States Department of Justice, and the CPUC.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are cooperating with the investigations.  It is uncertain when any such investigations will be complete.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are also conducting their own investigation into the cause of the 2022 Mosquito fire.  This investigation is ongoing.\nAs of February 5, 2025, PG&E Corporation and the Utility are aware of approximately \n25\n complaints on behalf of at least \n2,738\n individual plaintiffs related to the 2022 Mosquito fire and expect that they may receive further complaints.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility also are aware of a complaint on behalf of the Placer County Water Agency (“PCWA”), a complaint on behalf of the Middle Fork Project Finance Authority, and complaints on behalf of \nsix\n public entities.  The plaintiffs seek damages that include property damage, economic loss, punitive damages, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees, and other damages.  On April 24, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility filed cross-complaints against PCWA, alleging that conduct by PCWA was a substantial cause of the 2022 Mosquito fire.  The cross-complaints seek property damages, indemnification, attorneys’ fees, and other damages.  On January 28, 2025, the court entered an order setting the first individual claimant bellwether trial for November 7, 2025.\nBased on the current state of the law concerning inverse condemnation in California and the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, including the information gathered as part of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s investigation, PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe it is probable that they will incur a loss in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire.  Based on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this report, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $\n100\n million as of December 31, 2023 (before available insurance).  The aggregate liability remained unchanged as of December 31, 2024.\nPG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s accrued estimated losses do not include, among other things: (i) any amounts for potential penalties or fines that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities on PG&E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) any punitive damages, (iii) any amounts in respect of compensation claims by federal or state agencies including for state or federal fire suppression costs and damages related to federal land, or (iv) any other amounts that are not reasonably estimable.\n153\nAs noted above, the aggregate estimated liability for claims in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire does not include potential claims for fire suppression costs from federal, state, county, or local agencies or damage to land and vegetation in national parks or national forests.  As to these damages, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have not concluded that a loss is probable.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible losses for any such claims due to, among other factors, incomplete information as to facts pertinent to potential claims and defenses, as well as facts that would bear on the amount, type, and valuation of vegetation loss, potential reforestation, habitat loss, and other resources damaged or destroyed by the 2022 Mosquito fire.\nThe following table presents changes in the lower end of the range of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s reasonably estimable losses, net of payments, for claims arising from the 2022 Mosquito fire since December 31, 2023.\nLoss Accrual (in millions)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n85\n \nAccrued Losses\n—\n \nPayments\n(\n3\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n82\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Utility recorded an insurance receivable of $\n90\n million for probable insurance recoveries in connection with the 2022 Mosquito fire, including legal fees. \n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Utility also recorded a $\n7\n million reduction to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate and a $\n53\n million regulatory asset for costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the WEMA.  See “Regulatory Recovery” below.\nLoss Recoveries\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility have recovery mechanisms available for wildfire liabilities including from insurance, through rates, and from the Wildfire Fund.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a receivable for a recovery when it is deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur, and the Utility can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.  While the Utility plans to seek recovery of all insured losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount and timing of such recoveries.  For more information on the applicable facts and circumstances of the corresponding wildfires, see “2019 Kincade Fire,” “2021 Dixie Fire,” and “2022 Mosquito Fire.”\nTotal probable recoveries for the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire as of December 31, 2024 are:\nPotential Recovery Source (in millions)\n2021 Dixie fire\n2022 Mosquito fire\nInsurance\n$\n527\n \n$\n90\n \nFERC TO rates\n94\n \n7\n \nWEMA\n508\n \n53\n \nWildfire Fund\n925\n \n—\n \nProbable recoveries at December 31, 2024\n (1)\n$\n2,054\n \n$\n150\n \n(1) \nIncludes legal costs of $\n123\n million and $\n50\n million related to the 2021 Dixie fire and 2022 Mosquito fire, respectively, as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Utility could be subject to significant liability in connection with these wildfire events.  If such liability is not recoverable from insurance or the other mechanisms described in this section, it could have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nInsurance\nSelf-Insurance\nSince August 2023, the Utility’s wildfire liability insurance for amounts up to $\n1.0\n billion has been entirely based on self-insurance and will remain as such through at least 2026.  The self-insurance program includes a \n5\n% deductible, capped at a maximum of $\n50\n million, on claims that are incurred each year.\n154\nInsurance Receivable\nAs of December 31, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded total probable insurance recoveries of $\n527\n million and $\n90\n million in connection with the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire, respectively.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to seek full recovery for all insured losses.\nThe balances for insurance receivables with respect to wildfires are included in Other accounts receivable in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  \nThe following table presents changes in accrued insurance recoveries, net of reimbursements received, for the 2021 Dixie fire and 2022 Mosquito fire since December 31, 2023:\nInsurance Receivable (in millions)\n2021 Dixie fire\n2022 Mosquito fire\nTotal\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n326\n \n$\n63\n \n$\n389\n \nAccrued insurance recoveries\n1\n \n27\n \n28\n \nReimbursements\n(\n300\n)\n—\n \n(\n300\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n27\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n117\n \nRegulatory Recovery\nSection 451.1 of the Public Utilities Code provides that when determining an application to recover costs and expenses arising from a covered wildfire, the CPUC shall allow cost recovery if the costs and expenses are just and reasonable (i.e., the “prudency standard”).  AB 1054 states that a utility with a valid safety certification for the time period in which a covered wildfire ignited “shall be deemed to have been reasonable” unless “a party to the proceeding creates a serious doubt as to the reasonableness of the [Utility’s] conduct,” in which case the burden shifts to the utility to prove its conduct was reasonable.  The Utility had a valid safety certification at the time of the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire, so any analysis of cost recovery starts with this reasonableness presumption.  AB 1054 also allows the CPUC to allocate costs and expenses “in full or in part taking into account factors both within and beyond the Utility’s control that may have exacerbated the costs and expenses, including humidity, temperature, and winds.”\nThe Utility’s recorded receivables under the WEMA and with respect to the Wildfire Fund take into account this revised prudency standard and the presumption of reasonableness of the Utility’s conduct, based on the Utility’s interpretation of AB 1054 and the information currently available to the Utility.  Although the concept of “serious doubt” has been applied in other regulatory proceedings, such as FERC proceedings, the revised prudency standard under AB 1054 has not been interpreted or applied by the CPUC and it is possible that the CPUC could interpret or apply the standard differently, in which case the Utility may not be able to recover all or a portion of expenses that it has recorded as a receivable.\nFERC TO Rates\nThe Utility recognizes income and reduces its regulatory liability for potential refund through future FERC TO formula rates for a portion of the third-party wildfire-related claims in excess of insurance coverage.  The FERC presumes that a utility’s expenditures are prudent and permits cost recovery unless a party raises a serious doubt regarding the prudency of such costs.  The allocation to transmission customers was based on a FERC-approved allocation factor as determined in the formula rate.  Based on information currently available to the Utility regarding the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire, as of December 31, 2024, the Utility recorded reductions of $\n94\n million and $\n7\n million, respectively, to its regulatory liability for wildfire-related claims costs that were determined to be probable of recovery through the FERC TO formula rate.\nWEMA\nThe WEMA provides for tracking of incremental wildfire claims, outside legal costs, and insurance premiums above those authorized in rates.  With respect to wildfire claims and outside legal costs, the Utility expects that the same prudency standard as applies to the Wildfire Fund would also be applied in any CPUC review of an application filed by the Utility seeking recovery of such costs recorded to the WEMA.  See “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” below.  As of December 31, 2024, based on information currently available to the Utility, incremental wildfire claims-related costs for the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire were determined to be probable of recovery and the Utility recorded $\n508\n million and $\n53\n million, respectively, as regulatory assets in the WEMA.\n155\nWildfire Fund under AB 1054\nOn July 12, 2019, AB 1054 became law.  The law provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that will be available for eligible electric utility companies to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by the applicable electric utility company’s equipment, subject to the terms and conditions of AB 1054.  Each of California’s large electric IOUs has elected to participate in the Wildfire Fund.  Eligible claims are claims for third-party damages resulting from any such wildfires, limited to the portion of such claims that exceeds the greater of (i) $1.0 billion in the aggregate arising from wildfires in any Coverage Year and (ii) the amount of insurance coverage required to be in place for the electric utility company pursuant to Section 3293 of the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054.  The accrued Wildfire Fund receivable as of December 31, 2024 reflects an expectation that the Coverage Year will be based on the calendar year.\nElectric utility companies that draw from the Wildfire Fund will only be required to reimburse amounts that are determined by the CPUC in a proceeding for cost recovery not to be just and reasonable, applying the prudency standard in AB 1054 and after allocating costs and expenses for cost recovery based on relevant factors both within and outside of a utility’s control that may have exacerbated the costs and expenses.  This reimbursement requirement is subject to a disallowance cap equal to 20% of the equity portion of the IOU’s electric transmission and distribution rate base in the year of the prudency determination.  A utility would not be required to reimburse the Wildfire Fund for disallowances that exceed the disallowance cap in the aggregate in a three calendar-year period.  For the Utility, the disallowance cap would be approximately $\n4.1\n billion for 2024.  This disallowance cap is based on the equity portion of the Utility’s forecasted weighted-average 2024 electric transmission and distribution rate base, which is subject to adjustment based on changes in the Utility’s electric transmission and distribution rate base.  The disallowance cap is inapplicable in certain circumstances, including if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that the electric utility company’s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted “conscious or willful disregard for the rights and safety of others,” or the electric utility company failed to maintain a valid safety certification.  Costs that the CPUC determines to be just and reasonable in accordance with the prudency standard in AB 1054 will not be reimbursed to the Wildfire Fund, resulting in a draw-down of the Wildfire Fund.\nBefore the expiration of any current safety certification, the Utility must request a new safety certification from the OEIS, which the Utility expects to be issued within \n90\n days if the Utility has provided documentation that it has satisfied the requirements for the safety certification pursuant to Section 8389(e) of the Public Utilities Code, added by AB 1054.  An issued safety certification is valid for \n12\n months or until a timely request for a new safety certification is acted upon, whichever occurs later.  The safety certification is separate from the CPUC’s enforcement authority and does not preclude the CPUC from pursuing remedies for safety or other applicable violations.  On December 11, 2024, the OEIS approved the Utility’s 2024 application and issued the Utility’s 2024 safety certification.\nThe Wildfire Fund and disallowance cap will be terminated when the amounts in the fund are exhausted.  The Wildfire Fund is expected to be capitalized with at least $\n21\n billion through (i) a \n15-year\n non-bypassable charge to customers, (ii) $\n7.5\n billion in initial contributions from California’s three large electric IOUs and (iii) $\n300\n million in annual contributions paid by the participating electric IOUs for a \n10-year\n period.\nThe Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund.  Such funds could be depleted more quickly than PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s \n20\n-year estimate for the life of the Wildfire Fund, including as a result of claims made by California’s other participating electric utility companies.  The Wildfire Fund is available to pay for the Utility’s eligible claims arising as of July 12, 2019, the effective date of AB 1054, subject to a limit of 40% of the allowed amount of such claims arising between the effective date of AB 1054 and the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.  The 40% limit does not apply to eligible claims that arise after the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.  AB 1054 authorizes the reimbursement of funds where a participating utility has demonstrated that it exercised reasonable business judgment in the valuation and payment of third-party claims.\nAs of December 31, 2024, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $\n600\n million and $\n156\n million in Accounts receivable - other and Other noncurrent assets, respectively, for Wildfire Fund receivables related to the 2021 Dixie fire.  \nThe following table presents changes in accrued Wildfire Fund recoveries, net of claims paid by the Wildfire Fund received, for the 2021 Dixie fire since December 31, 2023:\nWildfire Fund Receivable (in millions)\n2021 Dixie fire\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n600\n \nAccrued Wildfire Fund recoveries\n325\nClaims paid by Wildfire Fund\n(\n169\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n756\n \n156\nFor more information, see Note 2 above.\nWildfire-Related Securities Litigation\nAs further described under the headings “Wildfire-Related Securities Claims in District Court” and “Wildfire-Related Securities Claims—Claims in the Bankruptcy Court Process,” PG&E Corporation and the Utility face certain wildfire-related securities claims related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other claims related to the 2018 Camp fire and the PSPS program in the Chapter 11 Cases (i.e., the Subordinated Claims), and certain former directors, former officers, and underwriters of certain note offerings face wildfire-related securities claims in the District Court action.  The claims described under the heading “Wildfire-Related Securities Claims in District Court” are referred to as the “Wildfire-Related Non-Bankruptcy Securities Claims” and collectively with the claims described under the heading “Wildfire-Related Securities Claims—Claims in the Bankruptcy Court Process” are referred to in this section as the “Wildfire-Related Securities Claims.”\nBased on the facts and circumstances available to PG&E Corporation and the Utility as of the date of this filing, PG&E Corporation believes it is probable that it will incur a loss in connection with these matters.  PG&E Corporation has recorded a liability in the aggregate amount of $\n300\n million, which represents its best estimate of probable losses for the Wildfire-Related Securities Claims.  PG&E Corporation believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount of loss could be greater or less than the accrued estimated amount due to the number of plaintiffs and the complexity of the litigation, and because a class settlement, if any, would be subject to, among other things, approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court, and class members would have the right to opt out of any such settlement.\nWildfire-Related Securities Claims in District Court\nIn June 2018, \ntwo\n purported securities class actions were filed in the District Court, naming PG&E Corporation and certain of its former officers as defendants, entitled\n David C. Weston v. PG&E Corporation, et al. \nand\n Jon Paul Moretti v. PG&E Corporation, et al.\n, respectively.  The complaints alleged material misrepresentations and omissions in various PG&E Corporation public disclosures related to, among other things, vegetation management and other issues connected to the 2017 Northern California wildfires.  The complaints asserted claims under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and sought unspecified monetary relief, interest, attorneys’ fees and other costs.  Both complaints identified a proposed class period of April 29, 2015 to June 8, 2018.  On September 10, 2018, the court consolidated both cases, and the litigation is now denominated \nIn re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigation,\n U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. 18-03509.  The court also appointed PERA as lead plaintiff.  PERA filed a consolidated amended complaint on November 9, 2018.  On December 14, 2018, PERA filed a second amended consolidated complaint to add allegations regarding the 2018 Camp fire, including allegations regarding transmission line safety and the PSPS program.\nOn February 22, 2019, a third purported securities class action was filed in the District Court, entitled \nYork County on behalf of the York County Retirement Fund, et al. v. Rambo, et al. \n(the “York County Action”).  The complaint named as defendants certain former officers and directors, as well as the underwriters of \nfour\n public offerings of notes from 2016 to 2018.  Neither PG&E Corporation nor the Utility was named as a defendant.  The complaint asserted claims under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, based on alleged material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with the note offerings related to, among other things, PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s vegetation management and wildfire safety measures.  On May 7, 2019, the York County Action was consolidated with \nIn re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigation.\nOn May 28, 2019, the plaintiffs in the consolidated securities actions filed a third amended consolidated class action complaint, which includes the claims asserted in the previously filed actions and names as defendants PG&E Corporation, the Utility, certain former officers and directors, and the underwriters.  On October 4, 2019, the officer, director, and underwriter defendants filed motions to dismiss the third amended complaint.\nOn March 21, 2023, another group of shareholders filed a separate action in the District Court against certain former officers and directors, entitled \nOrbis Capital Limited et al., v. Williams et al.\n, alleging similar claims to those alleged in \nIn re PG&E Corporation Securities Litigation\n.\nOn August 21, 2024, the District Court entered an order setting a briefing schedule for renewed motions to dismiss the third amended complaint.  Opening briefs were filed on October 24, 2024, opposition briefs were filed December 20, 2024, and reply briefs were filed January 31, 2025.\n157\nWildfire-Related Securities Claims—Claims in the Bankruptcy Court Process\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility intend to resolve securities claims filed in the bankruptcy consistent with the Plan.  These claims consist of pre-petition claims against PG&E Corporation or the Utility under the federal securities laws related to, among other things, allegedly misleading statements or omissions with respect to vegetation management and wildfire safety disclosures, and are classified into separate categories under the Plan, each of which is subject to subordination under the United States Bankruptcy Code.  The first category of claims consists of pre-petition claims arising from or related to the trading of common stock of PG&E Corporation (such claims, with certain other similar claims against PG&E Corporation, the “HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims”).  The second category of pre-petition claims, which comprises two separate classes under the Plan, consists of claims arising from the trading of debt securities issued by PG&E Corporation and the Utility (such claims, with certain other similar claims against PG&E Corporation and the Utility, the “Subordinated Debt Claims,” and together with the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, the “Subordinated Claims”).\nWhile PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe they have defenses to the Subordinated Claims, these defenses may not prevail and proceeds from any insurance may not be adequate to cover the full amount of the allowed claims.  In that case, PG&E Corporation and the Utility will be required, pursuant to the Plan, to satisfy any such allowed claims as follows:\n•\neach holder of an allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claim will receive a number of shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation equal to such holder’s HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claim Share (as such term is defined in the Plan); and\n•\neach holder of an allowed Subordinated Debt Claim will receive payment in full in cash.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility have engaged in settlement efforts with respect to the Subordinated Claims.  All such settlements have been conditioned upon, among other things, resolution of that claimant’s Wildfire-Related Non-Bankruptcy Securities Claims.  If any of the Subordinated Claims are ultimately not settled, PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect that those Subordinated Claims will be resolved by the Bankruptcy Court in the claims reconciliation process and treated as described above under the Plan.  Under the Plan, after the Emergence Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have the authority to compromise, settle, object to, or otherwise resolve proofs of claim, and the Bankruptcy Court retains jurisdiction to hear disputes arising in connection with disputed claims.  With respect to the Subordinated Claims, the claims reconciliation process may include litigation of the merits of such claims, including the filing of motions, fact discovery, and expert discovery.  The total number and amount of allowed Subordinated Claims, if any, was not determined at the Emergence Date.  To the extent any such claims are allowed, the total amount of such claims could be material, and therefore could result in (a) the issuance of a material number of shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation with respect to allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, or (b) the payment of a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims.  Such claims could have a material adverse impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nFurther, if shares are issued in respect of allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, it may be determined that, under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust should receive additional shares of common stock of PG&E Corporation such that it would have owned \n22.19\n% of the outstanding common stock of reorganized PG&E Corporation on the Emergence Date, assuming that such issuance of shares in satisfaction of the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims had occurred on the Emergence Date.\nOn January 25, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order to approve procedures to help facilitate the resolution of the Subordinated Claims.  The order, among other things, established procedures allowing PG&E Corporation and the Utility to collect trading information with respect to the Subordinated Claims, to engage in an alternative dispute resolution process for resolving disputed Subordinated Claims, and to file certain omnibus claim objections with respect to the Subordinated Claims.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility have worked to resolve the Subordinated Claims in accordance with procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court, including by collecting trading information from holders of Subordinated Claims.  Also, pursuant to those procedures, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have filed numerous omnibus objections in the Bankruptcy Court to certain of the Subordinated Claims.  The Bankruptcy Court has entered several orders disallowing and expunging Subordinated Claims that were subject to these omnibus objections, and certain Subordinated Claims subject to these omnibus objections remain pending.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to continue to prosecute omnibus objections with respect to certain of the Subordinated Claims and act under the procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court to resolve the Subordinated Claims.\n158\nIndemnification Obligations\nTo the extent permitted by law, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have obligations to indemnify directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while a director or officer is or was serving in such capacity, which indemnification obligations may extend to the claims asserted against certain directors and officers in the securities class actions.\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility additionally may have indemnification obligations to the underwriters for the Utility’s note offerings, pursuant to the underwriting agreements associated with those offerings.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s indemnification obligations to the officers, directors and underwriters may be limited or affected by the Chapter 11 Cases, among other things.\nButte County District Attorney’s Office Investigation into the 2018 Camp Fire\nFollowing the 2018 Camp fire, the Butte County District Attorney’s Office and the California Attorney General’s Office opened a criminal investigation of the 2018 Camp fire.\nOn March 17, 2020, the Utility entered into the Plea Agreement and Settlement (the “Plea Agreement”) with the People of the State of California, by and through the Butte County District Attorney’s Office to resolve the criminal prosecution of the Utility in connection with the 2018 Camp fire.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plea Agreement, the Utility pleaded guilty to \n84\n counts of involuntary manslaughter in violation of Penal Code section 192(b) and \none\n count of unlawfully causing a fire in violation of Penal Code section 452, and to admit special allegations pursuant to Penal Code sections 452.1(a)(2), 452.1(a)(3) and 452.1(a)(4).\nOn August 20, 2021, the Butte County Superior Court held a brief hearing on the status of restitution, which involves distribution of funds from the Fire Victim Trust.  The Butte County Superior Court has since continued the hearing to March 28, 2025.\nNOTE 15: \nOTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to enforcement and litigation matters and environmental remediation.  A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  The assessments of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involve a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly, and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, penalties related to regulatory compliance, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility exclude anticipated legal costs from the provision for loss and expense these costs as incurred.  The Utility also has substantial financial commitments in connection with agreements entered into to support its operating activities.  See “Purchase Commitments” below.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the outcome of the following matters.\nCPUC and FERC Matters\nTransmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to Refund\nRates under the TO rate case for 2017 (“TO18”) were in effect from March 1, 2017 through February 28, 2018.  Rates under the TO rate case for 2018 (“TO19”) were in effect from March 1, 2018 through April 30, 2019.  Rates under the TO rate case for 2019 (“TO20”) were in effect from May 1, 2019 through December 31, 2023.  The FERC previously approved settlement agreements for TO19 and TO20 resolving most issues.\n159\nOn May 31, 2024, the Utility submitted a settlement to the FERC resolving all outstanding issues in the TO18, TO19, and TO20 rate cases.  On August 22, 2024, the FERC approved the settlement.  As a result, the Utility will refund $\n236\n million, $\n358\n million, and $\n405\n million (plus applicable interest) to retail customers for TO18, TO19, and TO20, respectively.  Approval of the settlement did not have a material impact on the Utility’s financial statements in the year ended December 31, 2024.  The refunds will occur over 12 months, effective January 1, 2025.  The settlement provided that the Utility may seek authorization from the CPUC through a memorandum account to recover up to $\n473\n million through CPUC jurisdictional rates of the general, common and intangible plant cost that had been allocated to FERC-jurisdictional rates in TO18, TO19, and TO20.\n2022 WMCE Interim Rate Relief Subject to Refund\nOn December 15, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately $\n1.36\n billion of recorded expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $\n1.29\n billion (the “2022 WMCE application”).  The costs addressed in this application reflect costs related to wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events, as well as the implementation of various customer-focused initiatives.  These costs were incurred primarily in 2021.\nThe recorded expenditures consist of $\n1.2\n billion in expenses and $\n136\n million in capital expenditures.  On June 8, 2023, the CPUC adopted a final decision granting the Utility interim rate relief of $\n1.1\n billion to be recovered over 12 months, which went into effect July 1, 2023.  The remaining $\n224\n million will be recovered to the extent it is approved after the CPUC issues a final decision.  Cost recovery requested in this application is subject to the CPUC’s reasonableness review, which could result in some or all of the interim rate relief being subject to refund.\n2023 WMCE Interim Rate Relief Subject to Refund\nOn December 1, 2023, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately $\n2.18\n billion of recorded expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $\n1.86\n billion (the “2023 WMCE application”).  The costs addressed in this application reflect costs related to wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events, as well as implementation of various customer-focused initiatives.  These costs were incurred primarily in 2022.\nThe recorded expenditures consist of $\n1.6\n billion in expenses and $\n559\n million in capital expenditures.  Of these amounts, approximately 15% of expense, or $\n239\n million, and 30% of capital expenditures, or $\n167\n million, relate to the Utility’s response to the 2022-2023 extreme winter storms CEMA event.\nOn September 16, 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision on interim rate that grants the Utility interim rate relief of $\n944\n million, plus interest, subject to refund, to be recovered over at least 17 months starting October 1, 2024.   The remaining $\n914\n million, plus interest, would be recovered to the extent it is approved after the CPUC issues a final decision.  Cost recovery requested in this application is subject to the CPUC’s reasonableness review, which could result in some or all of the interim rate relief being subject to refund. \nWildfire and Gas Safety Costs Interim Rate Relief Subject to Refund\nOn June 15, 2023, the Utility filed a WGSC application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately $\n2.5\n billion of recorded expenditures related to wildfire mitigation costs and gas safety and electric modernization costs.\nThe recorded expenditures for wildfire mitigation consist of $\n726\n million in expenses and $\n1.5\n billion in capital expenditures and cover activities during the years 2020 to 2022.  The recorded expenditures for gas safety and electric modernization consist of $\n120\n million in expenses and $\n118\n million in capital expenditures and cover activities during the years 2017 to 2022.  If approved, the requested cost recovery would result in an aggregate revenue requirement of $\n688\n million.  The costs addressed in the WGSC application are incremental to those previously authorized in the Utility’s 2020 GRC and other proceedings.\nOn March 7, 2024, the CPUC approved a final decision authorizing the Utility to recover $\n516\n million in interim rates to be recovered over at least 12 months starting April 1, 2024.  The remaining $\n172\n million will be recovered to the extent it is approved after the CPUC issues a final decision.  Cost recovery requested in this application is subject to the CPUC’s reasonableness review, which could result in some or all of the interim rate relief being subject to refund. \n160\nOther Matters\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various claims and lawsuits that separately are not considered material.  Accruals for contingencies related to such matters totaled $\n74\n million and $\n89\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  These amounts were included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Included among these claims and lawsuits are the proofs of claim filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, except for proofs of claim discussed under “Wildfire-Related Securities Claims—Claims in the Bankruptcy Court Process” in Note 14.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility have resolved a significant majority of the proofs of claim.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue their review and analysis of certain remaining claims.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not believe it is reasonably possible that the resolution of these matters will have a material impact on their financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEnvironmental Remediation Contingencies\nGiven the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for estimating remediation liabilities requires significant judgment.  The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when the site assessments indicate that remediation is probable, and the Utility can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of probable amounts.  The Utility records an environmental remediation liability based on the lower end of the range of estimated probable costs, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.  Key factors that inform the development of estimated costs include site feasibility studies and investigations, applicable remediation actions, operations and maintenance activities, post-remediation monitoring, and the cost of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site.  Amounts recorded are not discounted to their present value.  \nThe Utility’s environmental remediation liability is primarily included in Noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is comprised of the following:\n \nBalance at\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nTopock natural gas compressor station\n$\n294\n \n$\n276\n \nHinkley natural gas compressor station\n97\n \n104\n \nFormer MGP sites owned by the Utility or third parties \n(1)\n782\n \n809\n \nUtility-owned generation facilities (other than fossil fuel-fired), other facilities, and third-party disposal sites \n(2)\n76\n \n107\n \nFossil fuel-fired generation facilities and sites \n(3)\n18\n \n19\n \nTotal environmental remediation liability\n$\n1,267\n \n$\n1,315\n \n(1) \nPrimarily driven by the following sites: San Francisco Beach Street, Napa, and San Francisco East Harbor.\n(2) \nPrimarily driven by geothermal landfill and Shell Pond site.\n(3)\n Primarily driven by the San Francisco Potrero Power Plant.\nThe Utility’s gas compressor stations, former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas gathering sites, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, and disposal of potentially hazardous substances are subject to requirements issued by the EPA under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in addition to other state laws relating to hazardous substances.  The Utility has a comprehensive program to comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to hazardous materials, waste, remediation activities, and other environmental requirements.  The Utility assesses and monitors the environmental requirements on an ongoing basis and implements changes to its program as deemed appropriate.  The Utility’s remediation activities are overseen by the DTSC, several California regional water quality control boards, and various other federal, state, and local agencies.\nThe Utility’s environmental remediation liability as of December 31, 2024, reflects its best estimate of probable future costs for remediation based on the current assessment data and regulatory obligations.  Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work necessary to implement final remediation plans, the Utility’s time frame for remediation, and unanticipated claims filed against the Utility.  The Utility may incur actual costs in the future that are materially different than this estimate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows during the period in which they are recorded.  As of December 31, 2024, the Utility expected to recover $\n1.1\n billion of its environmental remediation liability for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms authorized by the CPUC.\n161\nNatural Gas Compressor Station Sites\nThe Utility is legally responsible for remediating groundwater contamination caused by hexavalent chromium used in the past at the Utility’s natural gas compressor stations.  The Utility is also required to take measures to abate the effects of the contamination on the environment.\nTopock Site\nThe Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Topock site are subject to the regulatory authority of the DTSC and the U.S. Department of the Interior.  On April 24, 2018, the DTSC authorized the Utility to build an in-situ groundwater treatment system to convert hexavalent chromium into a non-toxic and non-soluble form of chromium.  Construction activities began in October 2018, and the initial phase of construction was completed in 2021.  Additional phases of construction will continue for several years.  It is reasonably possible that the Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Topock site may increase by as much as $\n211\n million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  The costs associated with environmental remediation at the Topock site are expected to be recovered primarily through the HSMA, where \n90\n% of the costs are recovered through rates.\nHinkley Site\nThe Utility’s remediation and abatement efforts at the Hinkley site are subject to the regulatory authority of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region.  In November 2015, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region adopted a clean-up and abatement order directing the Utility to contain and remediate the underground plume of hexavalent chromium and the potential environmental impacts.  The final order states that the Utility must continue and improve its remediation efforts, define the boundaries of the chromium plume, and take action to meet interim cleanup targets.  It is reasonably possible that the Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with the Hinkley site may increase by as much as $\n123\n million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  The costs associated with environmental remediation at the Hinkley site will not be recovered through rates.\nFormer Manufactured Gas Plants\nFormer MGPs used coal and oil to produce gas for use by the Utility’s customers before natural gas became available.  The by-products and residues of this process were often disposed of at the MGPs themselves.  The Utility has a program to manage the residues left behind as a result of the manufacturing process; many of the sites in the program have been addressed.  It is reasonably possible that the Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with MGP sites may increase by as much as $\n637\n million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation at identified MGP sites is greater than anticipated.  The costs associated with environmental remediation at the MGP sites are recovered through the HSMA, where \n90\n% of the costs are recovered through rates.\nUtility-Owned Generation Facilities and Third-Party Disposal Sites\nUtility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites often involve long-term remediation.  It is reasonably possible that the Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites may increase by as much as $\n67\n million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  The environmental remediation costs associated with the Utility-owned generation facilities and third-party disposal sites are recovered through the HSMA, where \n90\n% of the costs are recovered through rates.\nFossil Fuel-Fired Generation Sites\nIn 1998, the Utility divested its generation power plant business as part of generation deregulation.  Although the Utility sold its fossil-fueled power plants, the Utility retained the environmental remediation liability associated with each site.  It is reasonably possible that the Utility’s undiscounted future costs associated with fossil fuel-fired generation sites may increase by as much as $\n16\n million if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated.  The environmental remediation costs associated with the fossil fuel-fired sites will not be recovered through rates.\nNuclear Insurance\nThe Utility maintains multiple insurance policies through NEIL, a mutual insurer owned by utilities with nuclear facilities, and European Mutual Association for Nuclear Insurance (“EMANI”), covering nuclear or non-nuclear events at the Utility’s \ntwo\n nuclear generating units at DCPP and the Humboldt Bay independent spent fuel storage installation.\n162\nNEIL provides insurance coverage for property damages and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at the Utility’s two nuclear generating units at DCPP.  NEIL provides property damage and business interruption coverage of up to $\n3.2\n billion per nuclear incident (including terrorism and cybersecurity) and $\n2.5\n billion per non-nuclear incident for DCPP.  For Humboldt Bay independent spent fuel storage installation, NEIL provides up to $\n50\n million of coverage for nuclear and non-nuclear property damages.  These coverage amounts are shared by all NEIL members.  EMANI shares losses with NEIL as part of the first $\n400\n million of coverage within the current nuclear insurance program.  EMANI also provides an additional $\n200\n million in excess insurance for property damage and business interruption losses incurred by the Utility if a nuclear or non-nuclear event were to occur at DCPP.  If NEIL losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds, the Utility could be subject to a retrospective assessment.  If NEIL were to exercise this assessment, the maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for the Utility would be approximately $\n42\n million.  \nUnder the Price-Anderson Act, public liability claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur at DCPP, and that occur during the transportation of material to and from DCPP are limited to approximately $\n16.3\n billion.  The Utility purchases the maximum available public liability insurance of $\n500\n million for DCPP.  The balance of the $\n16.3\n billion of liability protection is provided under a loss-sharing program among nuclear reactor owners.  The Utility may be assessed up to $\n332\n million per nuclear incident under this loss sharing program, with payments in each year limited to a maximum of $\n49\n million per incident.  Both the maximum assessment and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every \nfive years\n.\nThe Price-Anderson Act does not apply to claims that arise from nuclear incidents that occur during shipping of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel enricher to a fuel fabricator or that occur at the fuel fabricator’s facility.  The Utility has a separate policy that provides coverage for claims arising from some of these incidents up to a maximum of $\n500\n million per incident.  In addition, the Utility has approximately $\n53\n million of liability insurance for the Humboldt Bay independent spent fuel storage installation and has a $\n500\n million indemnification from the NRC for public liability arising from nuclear incidents for the Humboldt Bay independent spent fuel storage installation, covering liabilities in excess of the $\n53\n million in liability insurance. \nPurchase Commitments\nThe following table shows the undiscounted future expected obligations under power purchase agreements that have been approved by the CPUC and have met specified construction milestones as well as undiscounted future expected payment obligations for natural gas supplies, natural gas transportation, natural gas storage, and nuclear fuel as of December 31, 2024:\n \nPower Purchase Agreements\n \n \n \n(in millions)\nRenewable\nEnergy\nConventional\nEnergy\nNatural\nGas\nOther\n (1)\nTotal\n2025\n$\n2,010\n \n$\n910\n \n$\n443\n \n$\n354\n \n$\n3,717\n \n2026\n1,952\n \n866\n \n348\n \n162\n \n3,328\n \n2027\n1,896\n \n800\n \n190\n \n284\n \n3,170\n \n2028\n1,875\n \n800\n \n103\n \n141\n \n2,919\n \n2029\n1,831\n \n716\n \n92\n \n43\n \n2,682\n \nThereafter\n14,229\n \n2,730\n \n41\n \n5\n \n17,005\n \nTotal purchase commitments\n$\n23,793\n \n$\n6,822\n \n$\n1,217\n \n$\n989\n \n$\n32,821\n \n(1) \nIncludes other power purchase agreements and nuclear fuel agreements.\nThird-Party Power Purchase Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Utility enters into various agreements, including renewable energy agreements, qualifying facilities (“QF”) agreements, and other power purchase agreements to purchase power and electric capacity.  The price of purchased power may be fixed or variable.  Variable pricing is generally based on the current market price of either natural gas or electricity at the date of delivery.\n163\nRenewable Energy\n \nPower Purchase Agreements\nIn order to comply with California’s RPS requirements, the Utility is required to deliver renewable energy to its customers at a gradually increasing rate.  The Utility has entered into various agreements to purchase renewable energy to help meet California’s requirement.  The Utility’s obligations under a significant portion of these agreements are contingent on the third party’s construction of new generation facilities, which are expected to grow.  These renewable energy contracts expire at various dates between 2025 and 2045.\nConventional Energy Power Purchase Agreements\nThe Utility has entered into many power purchase agreements for conventional generation resources, which include a tolling agreement and RA agreements.  The Utility’s obligations under a portion of these agreements are contingent on the third parties’ development of new generation facilities to provide capacity and energy products to the Utility.  These power purchase agreements expire at various dates between 2025 and 2044.\nOther Power Purchase Agreements\nThe Utility has entered into agreements to purchase energy and capacity with independent power producers that own generation facilities that meet the definition of a QF under federal law.  As of December 31, 2024, QF contracts in operation expire at various dates between 2025 and 2042.  In addition, the Utility has agreements with various irrigation districts and water agencies to purchase hydroelectric power.\nThe net costs incurred for all power purchases and electric capacity were $\n2.1\n billion in 2024, $\n2.4\n billion in 2023, and $\n2.8\n billion in 2022.\nNatural Gas Supply, Transportation, and Storage Commitments\nThe Utility purchases natural gas directly from producers and marketers in both Canada and the United States to serve its core customers, and to fuel its owned-generation facilities along with a facility associated with a third party tolling agreement.  The Utility also contracts for natural gas transportation from the points at which the Utility takes delivery (typically in Canada, the United States Rocky Mountain supply area, and the southwestern United States) to the points at which the Utility’s natural gas transportation system begins.  These agreements expire at various dates between 2025 and 2042.  In addition, the Utility has contracted for natural gas storage services in Northern California to more reliably meet customers’ loads.\nCosts incurred for natural gas purchases, natural gas transportation services, and natural gas storage, which include contracts with terms of less than 1 year, were $\n0.8\n billion in 2024, $\n2.5\n billion in 2023, and $\n2.4\n billion in 2022.\nNuclear Fuel Agreements\nThe Utility has entered into several purchase agreements for nuclear fuel.  These agreements expire at various dates between 2025 and 2030 and are intended to ensure long-term nuclear fuel supply.  The Utility relies on a number of international producers of nuclear fuel in order to diversify its sources and provide security of supply.  Pricing terms are also diversified, ranging from market-based prices to base prices that are escalated using published indices.\nPayments for nuclear fuel were $\n294\n million in 2024, $\n180\n million in 2023, and $\n44\n million in 2022.\n164\nOther Commitments\nPG&E Corporation and the Utility have other commitments primarily related to office facilities and land leases, which expire at various dates between 2025 and 2058, as well as other multi-year agreements.  \nAt December 31, 2024, the future minimum payments related to these commitments were as follows:\n(in millions)\nOther Commitments\n2025\n$\n84\n \n2026\n44\n \n2027\n47\n \n2028\n37\n \n2029\n34\n \nThereafter\n333\n \nTotal minimum payments\n$\n579\n \nPayments for other commitments were $\n105\n million in 2024, $\n106\n million in 2023, and $\n63\n million in 2022.  Certain office facility leases contain escalation clauses requiring annual increases in rent.  The rents may increase by a fixed amount each year, a percentage of the base rent, or the consumer price index.  There are options to extend these leases for \none\n to \nfive years\n.\nIn addition to the commitments in the table above, pursuant to SB 901, a shareholder contribution to the customer credit trust of $\n650\n million is to be made in 2025.  If the CPUC determines that it is needed, the Utility will make a supplemental shareholder contribution of up to $\n775\n million in 2040.  The Utility also will share with customers 25% of any surplus of shareholder assets in the customer credit trust at the end of the life of the trust.\nAdditionally, the Utility agreed to purchase the Lakeside Building for $\n906\n million, with deposits applicable to such purchase price of $\n150\n million paid by July 11, 2023, $\n250\n million paid by July 11, 2024, and the remaining $\n506\n million to be paid at closing in June 2025.  See “Oakland Headquarters Lease and Purchase” in Note 2 above.\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement of PG&E Corporation and the Utility is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the criteria established in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control\n — \nIntegrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n165\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 12, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRegulation and Regulated Operations—Refer to Notes 2, 3 and 14 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorized by the California Public Utility Commission (the “CPUC”) or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) based on its cost of providing service. Pacific Gas and Electric Company records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for nonregulated entities. Pacific Gas and Electric Company capitalizes and records, as regulatory assets, costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.\n166\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation, specifically costs subject to cost recovery proceedings that have not yet been approved, as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the significant degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the likelihood of recovery of incurred costs in current or future rates due in part to the uncertainty related to future decisions by the rate regulators. This required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and a significant degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s conclusions. \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the rate regulators included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) the evaluation of the likelihood of (a) the recovery of costs deferred as regulatory assets in future rates; and (b) regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates; (2) management’s determination that costs subject to cost recovery proceedings that have not yet been approved for recovery, meet the definition of a regulatory asset and are recorded at the appropriate amount; and (3) the review of disclosures related to these matters.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the CPUC and FERC for Pacific Gas and Electric Company and other public utilities in California, procedural filings, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the CPUC and FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset balances for completeness.\n•\nWe inspected Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s filings with the CPUC and FERC and the filings with the CPUC and FERC by intervenors that may impact Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.\n•\nFor regulatory assets approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes, we selected samples of costs and evaluated whether they met the definition of a regulatory asset by comparing the costs to the description of the costs approved by a CPUC decision and were recorded at the appropriate amount.\n•\nWe evaluated whether the Company’s disclosures were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained from our procedures performed.\nWildfire-Related Contingencies and Recoveries—Refer to Note 14 to the financial statements \nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, has recorded provisions for loss contingencies related to the 2019 Kincade fire, 2021 Dixie fire and 2022 Mosquito fire as of December 31, 2024. The loss contingencies represent the lower end of the range of reasonably possible losses in connection with each of the fires. Pacific Gas and Electric Company has also recorded estimated recoveries, inclusive of the Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account (“WEMA”), included within Noncurrent Regulatory Assets, and the Wildfire Fund Receivable, within Accounts Receivable—Other and Other Noncurrent Assets\nWe identified wildfire-related contingencies and related-recoveries, specifically the WEMA, as well as the related disclosures as a critical audit matter because (1) of the significant judgments made by management to estimate losses, (2) the outcome of the wildfire-related contingencies materially affects the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows and (3) the significant judgments made by management in determining whether recoveries from WEMA are probable. This required the application of a significant degree of auditor judgment and audit effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimated losses, related recoveries, and disclosures.\n167\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s judgments regarding its estimated losses for wildfire-related contingencies, related recoveries, and disclosures included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s determination of whether a loss was probable and/or reasonably possible and whether recoveries were probable; (2) the determination of the significant assumptions used in estimating the amount of probable loss, if any, including the information gained through investigations into the cause of the fire, information from claimants, and the advice of legal counsel that may impact the valuation of the liability; and (3) the disclosures related to the wildfires.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s judgments related to whether a loss was probable and/or reasonably possible for the wildfires and whether recoveries are probable, by inquiring of management and Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s legal counsel regarding the amount of probable and/or reasonably possible losses for each fire, including the potential impact of information gained through investigations into the cause of each fire, information from claimants, communication with insurers, the advice of legal counsel, and by reading external information for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.\n•\nWe obtained an analysis from management for recoveries specific to WEMA, regarding probability of recovery for deferred costs not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery.\n•\nWe evaluated the estimation methodology for determining the amount of probable loss through inquiries with management; we tested the significant assumptions used in the valuation of the liability.  \n•\nWe read the legal letters from Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s external and internal legal counsel regarding known information, and evaluated whether the information therein was consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.\n•\nWe evaluated whether Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s disclosures were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained from our procedures performed.\n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 12, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1999.\n168\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Pacific Gas and Electric Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and subsidiaries (the “Utility”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Utility as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Utility’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Utility’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Utility’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Utility’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Utility in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRegulation and Regulated Operations—Refer to Notes 2, 3 and 14 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Utility follows accounting principles for rate-regulated entities and collects rates from customers to recover “revenue requirements” that have been authorized by the California Public Utility Commission (the “CPUC”) or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) based on its cost of providing service. The Utility records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for nonregulated entities. The Utility capitalizes and records, as regulatory assets, costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates.\n169\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation, specifically costs subject to cost recovery proceedings that have not yet been approved, as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the significant degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the likelihood of recovery of incurred costs in current or future rates due in part to the uncertainty related to future decisions by the rate regulators. This required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and a significant degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s conclusions.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost‐based rate regulation related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the rate regulators included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) the evaluation of the likelihood of (a) the recovery of costs deferred as regulatory assets in future rates; and (b) regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates; (2) management’s determination that costs subject to cost recovery proceedings that have not yet been approved for recovery, meet the definition of a regulatory asset and are recorded at the appropriate amount; and (3) the review of disclosures related to these matters.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the CPUC and FERC for the Utility and other public utilities in California, procedural filings, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the CPUC and FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset balances for completeness.\n•\nWe inspected the Utility’s filings with the CPUC and FERC and the filings with the CPUC and FERC by intervenors that may impact the Utility’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.\n•\nFor regulatory assets approved by a CPUC decision for tracking purposes, we selected samples of costs and evaluated whether they met the definition of a regulatory asset by comparing the costs to the description of the costs approved by a CPUC decision and were recorded at the appropriate amount.\n•\nWe evaluated whether the Utility’s disclosures were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained from our procedures performed.\nWildfire-Related Contingencies and Recoveries—Refer to Note 14 to the financial statements \nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Utility has recorded provisions for loss contingencies related to the 2019 Kincade fire, 2021 Dixie fire and 2022 Mosquito fire as of December 31, 2024. The loss contingencies represent the lower end of the range of reasonably possible losses in connection with each of the fires. The Utility has also recorded estimated recoveries, inclusive of the Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account (“WEMA”), included within Noncurrent Regulatory Assets, and the Wildfire Fund Receivable, within Accounts Receivable - Other and Other Noncurrent Assets.\nWe identified wildfire-related contingencies and related-recoveries, specifically the WEMA, as well as the related disclosures as a critical audit matter because (1) of the significant judgments made by management to estimate losses, (2) the outcome of the wildfire-related contingencies materially affects the Utility’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows and (3) the significant judgments made by management in determining whether recoveries from WEMA are probable. This required the application of a significant degree of auditor judgment and audit effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimated losses, related recoveries, and disclosures.\n170\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s judgments regarding its estimated losses for wildfire‐related contingencies, related recoveries, and disclosures included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over (1) the Utility’s determination of whether a loss was probable and/or reasonably possible and whether recoveries were probable; (2) the determination of the significant assumptions used in estimating the amount of probable loss, if any, including the information gained through investigations into the cause of the fire, information from claimants, and the advice of legal counsel that may impact the valuation of the liability; and (3) the disclosures related to the wildfires.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s judgments related to whether a loss was probable and/or reasonably possible for the wildfires and whether recoveries are probable, by inquiring of management and the Utility’s legal counsel regarding the amount of probable and/or reasonably possible losses for each fire, including the potential impact of information gained through investigations into the cause of each fire, information from claimants, communication with insurers, the advice of legal counsel, and by reading external information for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.\n•\nWe obtained an analysis from management for recoveries specific to WEMA, regarding probability of recovery for deferred costs not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery.\n•\nWe evaluated the estimation methodology for determining the amount of probable loss through inquiries with management; we tested the significant assumptions used in the valuation of the liability.  \n•\nWe read the legal letters from the Utility’s external and internal legal counsel regarding known information, and evaluated whether the information therein was consistent with the information obtained in our procedures.\n•\nWe evaluated whether the Utility’s disclosures were appropriate and consistent with the information obtained from our procedures performed.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 12, 2025\nWe have served as the Utility’s auditor since 1999.\n171\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PG&E Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Francisco, California  \nFebruary 12, 2025\n172\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Pacific Gas and Electric Company\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and subsidiaries (the “Utility”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control— Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
