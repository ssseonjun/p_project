    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our cash flow is affected by supply and demand for natural gas, NGL products, and crude oil, and by natural gas, NGL, crude oil and condensate prices, and decreases in supply, demand or these prices could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.”\n\n\n \n\n\nOur operating income generally improves in an environment of higher natural gas, NGL and condensate prices. Our processing profitability is largely dependent upon pricing and the supply of and market demand for natural gas, NGLs and condensate, both of which are beyond our control. In a declining commodity price environment, without taking into account our hedges, we will realize a reduction in cash flows under our percent-of-proceeds contracts proportionate to average price declines. While we have a significant level of margin that we derive from fee-based arrangements across our operations and particularly for our assets in the Downstream Business, our contract mix, along with our commodity hedging program, serves to mitigate the impact of commodity price movements on our cash flows. For additional information regarding our hedging activities, see “Item 7A.

Our operations are affected by the level of crude, natural gas and NGL prices, the relationship among these prices and related activity levels from our customers. In our gathering and processing operations, plant inlet volumes, crude oil volumes and capacity utilization rates generally are driven by wellhead production and our competitive and contractual position on a regional basis and more broadly by the impact of prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs on exploration and production activity in the areas of our operations. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as crude oil and natural gas prices decrease below commercially acceptable levels. Producers generally focus their drilling activity on certain basins depending on commodity price fundamentals. Our asset systems are predominantly located in some of the most economic basins in the United States.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe factors that impact the gathering and processing volumes also impact the total volumes that flow to our Downstream Business. Accordingly, increased producer activity will drive demand for our midstream services and may result in incremental growth capital expenditures. Demand for our transportation, fractionation and other fee-based services is largely correlated with producer activity levels. Demand for our international export, storage and terminaling services has remained relatively constant, as demand for these services is based on a number of domestic and international factors.\n\n\n \n\n\nContract Terms, Contract Mix and the Impact of Commodity Prices\n\n\n \n\n\nAcross our operations and particularly in our Downstream Business, we benefit from long-term fee-based arrangements for our services. Our Gathering and Processing segment contract mix also has components of fee-based margin, such as fee floors and other fee-based services which mitigate against low commodity prices. The significant level of margin we derive from fee-based arrangements combined with our hedging arrangements helps to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements. Volatility in commodity prices can have a significant impact on our profitability, especially those percent-of-proceeds contracts that create direct exposure to changes in energy prices by paying us for gathering and processing services with a portion of proceeds from the commodities handled (“equity volumes”).\n \n\n\n \n\n\nContract terms in the Gathering and Processing segment are based upon a variety of factors, including natural gas and crude quality, geographic location, competitive dynamics and the pricing environment at the time the contract is executed, and customer requirements. Our gathering and processing contract mix and, accordingly, our exposure to crude, natural gas and NGL prices may change as a result of producer preferences, competition and changes in production as wells decline at different rates or are added, our expansion into regions where different types of contracts are more common and other market factors.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe contract terms and contract mix of our Downstream Business can also have a significant impact on our results of operations. Transportation and fractionation services are supported by fee-based contracts whose rates and terms are driven by NGL supply and transportation and fractionation capacity. Export services are supported by fee-based contracts whose rates and terms are driven by global LPG supply and demand fundamentals. The Logistics and Transportation segment includes predominantly fee-based contracts.\n\n\n \n\n\nImpact of Our Commodity Price Hedging Activities\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have hedged the commodity price risk associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, NGL and condensate equity volumes, future commodity purchases and sales, and transportation basis risk by entering into financially settled derivative transactions. These transactions include swaps, futures, and purchased puts (or floors) and calls (or caps) to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk. We intend to continue managing our exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into derivative transactions. We actively manage the Downstream Business product inventory and other working capital levels to reduce exposure to changing prices. For additional information regarding our hedging activities, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk–Commodity Price Risk.”\n\n\n \n\n\nOperating Expenses\n\n\n \n\n\nVariable costs such as service and repairs can impact our results. Continued expansion of existing assets will also give rise to additional operating expenses, which will affect our results. The employees supporting our operations are employees of Targa Resources LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVolatile Capital Markets and Competition\n\n\n \n\n\nWe continuously consider and enter into discussions regarding potential growth projects and acquisitions and may contemplate external funding for potential growth projects and acquisitions. Any limitations on our access to capital may impair our ability to execute this strategy. If the cost of such capital becomes too expensive, our ability to develop or acquire strategic and accretive assets may be limited. We may not be able to raise the necessary funds on satisfactory terms, if at all. The primary factors influencing our cost of borrowing include interest rates, credit spreads, covenants, underwriting or loan origination fees and similar charges we pay to lenders. These factors may impair our ability to execute our growth and acquisition strategy.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCurrent economic conditions and competition for asset purchases and development opportunities could limit our ability to fully execute our growth strategy. Due to increased volatility in commodity prices and the broader market, the ability of companies in the oil and gas industry to seek financing and access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all has been negatively impacted. We believe we have sufficient access to financial resources and liquidity necessary to meet our requirements for working capital, debt service payments and capital expenditures in 2025 and beyond. For additional information regarding our financing activities, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\n\n\n \n\n\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\n\n\n \n\n\nThe profitability of our business is a function of the difference between: (i) the revenues we receive from our operations, including fee-based revenues from services and revenues from the natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate we sell, and (ii) the costs associated with conducting our operations, including the costs of wellhead natural gas, crude oil and mixed NGLs that we purchase as well as operating, general and administrative costs and the impact of our commodity hedging activities. Because commodity price movements tend to impact both revenues and costs, increases or decreases in our revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in our profitability. Our contract portfolio, the prevailing pricing environment for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, the impact of our commodity hedging program and its ability to mitigate exposure to commodity price movements, and the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGL throughput on our systems are important factors in determining our profitability. Our profitability is also affected by the NGL content in gathered wellhead natural gas, supply and demand for our products and services, utilization of our assets and changes in our customer mix.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur profitability is also impacted by fee-based contracts. Our growing capital expenditures for pipelines and gathering and processing assets underpinned by fee-based margin, expansion of our Downstream facilities, continued focus on adding fee-based margin to our existing and future gathering and processing contracts, as well as third-party acquisitions of businesses and assets, will continue to increase the number of our contracts that are fee-based. Fixed fees for services such as gathering and processing, transportation, fractionation, storage, terminaling and crude oil gathering are not directly tied to changes in market prices for commodities. Nevertheless, a change in market dynamics such as available commodity throughput does affect profitability.\n\n\n \n\n\nManagement uses a variety of financial measures and operational measurements to analyze our performance. These include: (i) throughput volumes, facility efficiencies and fuel consumption, (ii) operating expenses, (iii) capital expenditures and (iv) the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash flow from operations, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted operating margin (segment).\n\n\n \n\n\nThroughput Volumes, Facility Efficiencies and Fuel Consumption\n\n\n \n\n\nOur profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of natural gas supply and crude oil supply to offset the natural decline of existing volumes from oil and natural gas wells that are connected to our gathering and processing systems. This is achieved by connecting new wells and adding new volumes in existing areas of production, as well as by capturing crude oil and natural gas supplies currently gathered by third parties. Similarly, our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of mixed NGL supply, connected by third-party transportation and Grand Prix, to our Downstream Business fractionation facilities and at times to our export facilities. We fractionate NGLs generated by our gathering and processing plants, as well as by contracting for mixed NGL supply from third-party facilities.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, we seek to increase adjusted operating margin by limiting volume losses, reducing fuel consumption and by increasing efficiency. With our gathering systems’ extensive use of remote monitoring capabilities, we monitor the volumes received at the wellhead or central delivery points along our gathering systems, the volume of natural gas received at our processing plant inlets and the volumes of NGLs and residue natural gas recovered by our processing plants. We also monitor the volumes of NGLs received, stored, fractionated and delivered across our logistics assets. This information is tracked through our processing plants and Downstream Business facilities to determine customer settlements for sales and volume related fees for service and helps us increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.\n\n\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs part of monitoring the efficiency of our operations, we measure the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points on our gathering systems and the volume received at the inlet of our processing plants as an indicator of fuel consumption and line loss. We also track the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the inlet of the processing plant and the NGLs and residue gas produced at the outlet of such plant to monitor the fuel consumption and recoveries of our facilities. Similar tracking is performed for our crude oil gathering and logistics assets and our NGL pipelines. These volume, recovery and fuel consumption measurements are an important part of our operational efficiency analysis and safety programs.\n\n\n \n\n\nOperating Expenses\n\n\n \n\n\nOperating expenses are costs associated with the operation of specific assets. Labor, contract services, repair and maintenance and ad valorem taxes comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses. These expenses remain relatively stable and independent of the volumes through our systems, but may increase with system expansions and inflation, and will fluctuate depending on the scope of the activities performed during a specific period.\n\n\n \n\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\n\n \n\n\nOur capital expenditures are classified as growth capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures. Growth capital expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets, extend asset useful lives, increase capacities from existing levels, add capabilities, and reduce costs or enhance revenues. Maintenance capital expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of system components and equipment, which are worn, obsolete or completing their useful life and expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\n\n\n \n\n\nCapital spending associated with growth and maintenance projects is closely monitored. Return on investment is analyzed before a capital project is approved, spending is closely monitored throughout the development of the project, and the subsequent operational performance is compared to the assumptions used in the economic analysis performed for the capital investment approval.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\n\n\n \n\n\nWe utilize non-GAAP measures to analyze our performance. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash flow from operations, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted operating margin (segment) are non-GAAP measures. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to these non-GAAP measures are income (loss) from operations, Net income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp. and segment operating margin. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures and have important limitations as analytical tools. Investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because our non-GAAP measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect income and segment operating margin, and are defined differently by different companies within our industry, our definitions may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. Management compensates for the limitations of our non-GAAP measures as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into our decision-making processes.\n\n\n \n\n\nAdjusted Operating Margin\n\n\n \n\n\nWe define adjusted operating margin for our segments as revenues less product purchases and fuel. It is impacted by volumes and commodity prices as well as by our contract mix and commodity hedging program.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGathering and Processing adjusted operating margin consists primarily of:\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nservice fees related to natural gas and crude oil gathering, treating and processing; and \n\n\n \n\n\n•\nrevenues from the sale of natural gas, condensate, crude oil and NGLs less producer settlements, fuel and transport and our equity volume hedge settlements. \n\n\n \n\n\nLogistics and Transportation adjusted operating margin consists primarily of:\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nservice fees (including the pass-through of energy costs included in certain fee rates);\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nsystem product gains and losses; and \n\n\n \n\n\n•\nNGL and natural gas sales, less NGL and natural gas purchases, fuel, third-party transportation costs and the net inventory change. \n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe adjusted operating margin impacts of mark-to-market hedge unrealized changes in fair value are reported in Other.\n\n\n \n\n\nAdjusted operating margin for our segments provides useful information to investors because it is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, including investors and commercial banks, to assess:\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nthe financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nour operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; and\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nthe viability of capital expenditure projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.\n\n\n \n\n\nManagement reviews adjusted operating margin and operating margin for our segments monthly as a core internal management process. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating our operating results.\n The reconciliation of our adjusted operating margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is presented under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – By Reportable Segment.”\n\n\n \n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n\n \n\n\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as Net income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp. before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other items that we believe should be adjusted consistent with our core operating performance. The adjusting items are detailed in the adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table and its footnotes. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks and others to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our indebtedness and pay dividends to our investors.\n\n\n \n\n\nAdjusted Cash Flow\n from Operations and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\n\n\n \n\n\nWe define adjusted cash flow from operations as adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense on debt obligations and cash taxes. We define adjusted free cash flow as adjusted cash flow from operations less maintenance capital expenditures (net of any reimbursements of project costs) and growth capital expenditures, net of contributions from noncontrolling interest and including contributions to investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted cash flow from operations and adjusted free cash flow are performance measures used by us and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess our ability to generate cash earnings (after servicing our debt and funding capital expenditures) to be used for corporate purposes, such as payment of dividends, retirement of debt or redemption of other financing arrangements.\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOur Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures used by management to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for the periods indicated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReconciliation of Net income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp. to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp.\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,312.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,345.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest (income) expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n767.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n687.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n\n\n \n\n\n384.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n363.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n\n\n \n\n\n1,423.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,329.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Gain) loss on sale or disposition of assets\n\n\n \n\n\n(3.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(5.3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite-down of assets\n\n\n \n\n\n6.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Gain) loss from financing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n0.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity (earnings) loss\n\n\n \n\n\n(9.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(9.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributions from unconsolidated affiliates\n\n\n \n\n\n25.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompensation on equity grants\n\n\n \n\n\n63.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk management activities\n\n\n \n\n\n164.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(275.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoncontrolling interests adjustments (1)\n\n\n \n\n\n3.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(3.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLitigation expense (2)\n\n\n \n\n\n4.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,142.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,530.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense on debt obligations (3)\n\n\n \n\n\n(752.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(675.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n(17.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(13.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted Cash Flow from Operations\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,372.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,840.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintenance capital expenditures, net (4)\n\n\n \n\n\n(231.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(223.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth capital expenditures, net (4)\n\n\n \n\n\n(3,000.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2,224.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\n\n\n$\n\n\n140.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n392.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nRepresents adjustments related to our subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests, including depreciation and amortization expense as well as earnings for certain plants within our WestTX joint venture not subject to noncontrolling interest.\n\n\n(2)\nLitigation expense includes charges related to litigation resulting from the major winter storm in February 2021 that we consider outside the ordinary course of our business and/or not reflective of our ongoing core operations.

Operations.”\n\n\nNM        Due to a low denominator, the noted percentage change is disproportionately high and as a result, considered not meaningful.\n\n\n \n\n\n2024 Compared to 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nCommodity sales are relatively flat reflecting lower natural gas and condensate prices ($1,242.8 million) and the unfavorable impact of hedges ($686.5 million), offset by higher NGL, natural gas and condensate volumes ($1,607.2 million), and higher NGL prices ($251.6 million).\n\n\n \n\n\nThe increase in fees from midstream services is primarily due to higher gas gathering and processing fees, higher transportation and fractionation fees, and higher export volumes.\n\n\n \n\n\nProduct purchases and fuel are relatively flat reflecting higher NGL and natural gas volumes, offset by lower natural gas prices.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher labor, maintenance, rental and chemical costs as a result of increased activity and system expansions, partially offset by lower taxes.\n\n\n \n\n\nSee “—Results of Operations—By Reportable Segment” for additional information on a segment basis.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the impact of system expansions on our asset base, partially offset by the shortening of depreciable lives of certain assets that were idled in 2023.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and professional fees.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe increase in interest expense, net, is due to recognition of cumulative interest on a 2024 legal ruling associated with the Splitter Agreement and higher borrowings, partially offset by higher capitalized interest. Higher capitalized interest is due to system expansions and higher interest rates. See Note 17 – Contingencies for additional information related to the legal ruling.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe increase in income tax expense is primarily due to the release of state valuation allowance in 2023.\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe premium on repurchase of noncontrolling interests, net of tax is primarily due to the CBF Acquisition in 2024 and the Grand Prix Transaction in 2023.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults of Operations—By Reportable Segment\n\n\n \n\n\nOur operating margins by reportable segment are:\n \n\n\n

Marketing margin increased due to greater optimization opportunities. LPG export margin increased due to higher volumes as we benefited from the completion of the export expansion project during the third quarter of 2023 and the Houston Ship Channel allowing night-time vessel transits, partially offset by maintenance and required inspections.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe increase in operating expenses was due to higher system volumes, higher compensation and benefits, higher taxes, higher repairs and maintenance and the addition of two trains during 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOther\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024 vs. 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating margin\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(164.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n275.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(440.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted operating margin\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(164.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n275.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(440.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther contains the results of commodity derivative activity mark-to-market gains/losses related to derivative contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges.

See further details of our risk management program in “Item 7A. – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, inclusive of our consolidated joint venture accounts, we had $157.3 million of Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On a consolidated basis, our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flows from operations, borrowings under the New TRGP Revolver, Commercial Paper Program, Securitization Facility, and access to debt and equity capital markets. We supplement these sources of liquidity with joint venture arrangements and proceeds from asset sales. Our exposure to adverse credit conditions includes our credit facilities, cash investments, hedging abilities, customer performance risks and counterparty performance risks.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe believe our sources of liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months to satisfy our obligations. Our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These include commodity prices and ongoing efforts to manage operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. For additional discussion on recent factors impacting our liquidity and capital resources, see “Recent Developments.”\n\n\n \n\n\nShort-term Liquidity\n\n\n \n\n\nOur principal sources of short-term liquidity consist of internally generated cash flow, borrowings available under the New TRGP Revolver, as well as our right to request additional commitment increases under the New TRGP Revolver, our Commercial Paper Program, the Securitization Facility, proceeds from debt and equity offerings, and joint ventures and/or asset sales. Based on anticipated levels of operations and absent any disruptive events, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to finance our operations, capital expenditures, quarterly cash dividends and obligations, as discussed further below, for at least the next twelve months.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOur short-term liquidity on a consolidated basis as of February 18, 2025 was:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nConsolidated Total\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash on hand (1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n254.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal availability under the Securitization Facility\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n600.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal availability under the New TRGP Revolver and Commercial Paper Program\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,500.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,354.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding borrowings under the Securitization Facility\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(600.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding borrowings under the New TRGP Revolver and Commercial Paper Program\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(881.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding letters of credit under the New TRGP Revolver\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(9.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal liquidity\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,864.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nIncludes cash held in our consolidated joint venture accounts.\n\n\n \n\n\nOther potential capital resources associated with our existing arrangements include our right to request an additional $500.0 million in commitment increases under the New TRGP Revolver, subject to the terms therein. The New TRGP Revolver matures on February 18, 2030. The maturity date is extendable, subject to the lenders’ consent, by one year up to two times.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn August 2024, the Partnership amended the Securitization Facility to, among other things, extend the termination date of the Securitization Facility to August 29, 2025.\n\n\n \n\n\nA portion of our capital resources are allocated to letters of credit to satisfy certain counterparty credit requirements. As of December 31, 2024, we had $17.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Existing TRGP Revolver. The letters of credit also reflect certain\n \n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncounterparties’ views of our financial condition and ability to satisfy our performance obligations, as well as commodity prices and other factors.\n\n\n \n\n\nWorking Capital\n\n\n \n\n\nWorking capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. On a consolidated basis, at the end of any given month, accounts receivable and payable tied to commodity sales and purchases are relatively balanced, with receivables from customers being offset by plant settlements payable to producers. The factors that typically cause overall variability in our reported total working capital are: (i) our cash position; (ii) liquids inventory levels, which we closely manage, as well as liquids valuations; (iii) changes in payables and accruals related to major growth capital projects; (iv) changes in the fair value of the current portion of derivative contracts; (v) monthly swings in borrowings under the Securitization Facility; and (vi) major structural changes in our asset base or business operations, such as certain organic growth capital projects and acquisitions or divestitures.\n\n\n \n\n\nWorking capital as of December 31, 2024 decreased $310.0 million compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to higher accounts payable related to capital spending on growth projects, higher product purchases and fuel payables resulting from higher NGL volumes and prices, and higher net liabilities for hedging activities, partially offset by higher receivables resulting from higher NGL volumes and prices, and a lower outstanding balance on the Securitization Facility.\n\n\n \n\n\nLong-term Financing\n\n\n \n\n\nOur long-term financing consists of potentially raising funds through long-term debt obligations, the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, or joint venture arrangements. The majority of our debt is fixed rate borrowings; however, we have some exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of the variable rate borrowings under the New TRGP Revolver, the Securitization Facility, and the Commercial Paper Program. We may enter into interest rate hedges with the intent to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on cash flows. As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any interest rate hedges.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIn August 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of the 5.500% Notes, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $990.1 million. We used the net proceeds from the issuance to repay borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program, a portion of which were incurred to repay the remaining balance under the Term Loan Facility, and for general corporate purposes.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the future, we or the Partnership may redeem, purchase or exchange certain of our and/or the Partnership’s outstanding debt through redemption calls, cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such calls, repurchases, exchanges or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\n\n\n \n\n\nTo date, our debt balances and our subsidiaries’ debt balances have not adversely affected our operations, ability to grow or ability to repay or refinance indebtedness.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFor information about our debt obligations, see Note 8 – Debt Obligations to our consolidated financial statements. For information about our interest rate risk, see “Item 7A.

In addition, we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to commodity price risk.

See the description of our accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements for additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates.\n\n\n \n\n\nBusiness Acquisitions\n\n\n \n\n\nFor business acquisitions, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Goodwill results when the cost of a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business. Determining fair value requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to projections of future production volumes, pricing and cash flows, benchmark analysis of comparable public companies, discount rates, expectations regarding customer contracts and relationships, and other management estimates. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, the duration of each liability, and any resulting goodwill can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition. See Note 4 – Acquisitions and Divestitures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment and Amortization of Intangible Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation of our property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. The determination of useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires us to make various assumptions, including our expected use of the asset and the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served, normal wear and tear of facilities, and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe amortize the costs of our intangible assets in a manner that closely resembles the expected benefit pattern of the intangible assets or on a straight-line basis where such pattern is not readily determinable, over the periods in which we benefit from services provided to customers. At the time assets are placed in service or acquired, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation/amortization amounts prospectively.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, including Intangible Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate our carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including changes to our estimates that could have an impact on our assessment of asset recoverability. Asset recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with its expected future pre-tax undiscounted cash flows. Individual assets are grouped at the lowest level for which the related identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. These cash flow estimates require us to make judgments and assumptions related to operating and cash flow results, economic obsolescence, the business climate, contractual, legal and other factors.\n\n\n \n\n\nIf the carrying amount exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flows, we recognize a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge equal to the excess of net book value over fair value. The estimated cash flows used to assess recoverability of our long-lived assets and measure fair value of our asset groups are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price and volume projections reflective of the current environment and management's projections for long-term average prices and volumes. In addition to near and long-term price assumptions, other key assumptions include volume projections, operating costs, timing of incurring such costs and the use of an appropriate terminal value and discount rate. Any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of recoverability of our long-lived assets and the recognition of additional impairments.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPrice Risk Management (Hedging)\n\n\n \n\n\nOur net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. In an effort to reduce the volatility of our cash flows, we have entered into derivative financial instruments to hedge the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, NGL, and condensate equity volumes, future commodity purchases and sales, and transportation basis risk.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOne of the factors that can affect our operating results each period is the price assumptions used to value our derivative financial instruments, which are reflected at their fair values on the balance sheet. We determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using\n \n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npresent value methods or standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Changes in the methods or assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of our derivative instruments could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\n \n\n\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that will affect us, see Note 3 – Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n \n\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati\nve Disclosures About Market Risk\n\n\n \n\n\nOur principal market risks are our exposure to changes in commodity prices, particularly to the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, changes in interest rates, as well as nonperformance by our risk management counterparties and customers.\n\n\n \n\n\nRisk Management\n\n\n \n\n\nWe evaluate counterparty risks related to our commodity derivative contracts and trade credit. All of our commodity derivatives are with major financial institutions or major energy companies. Should any of these financial counterparties not perform, we may not realize the benefit of some of our hedges under lower commodity prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We sell our natural gas, NGLs and condensate to a variety of purchasers. Non-performance by a trade creditor could result in losses.\n\n\n \n\n\nCrude oil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile. In an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows, we have entered into derivative instruments to hedge the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, NGL and condensate equity volumes, future commodity purchases and sales, and transportation basis risk through 2028. Market conditions may also impact our ability to enter into future commodity derivative contracts.\n\n\n \n\n\nCommodity Price Risk\n\n\n \n\n\nA portion of our revenues are derived from percent-of-proceeds contracts under which we receive a portion of the proceeds from the sale of commodities as payment for services. The prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. We monitor these risks and enter into hedging transactions designed to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations on our business. Cash flows from a derivative instrument designated as a hedge are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the item being hedged.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge some of the exposure to commodity price risk and reduce fluctuations in our operating cash flow due to fluctuations in commodity prices. In an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows, as of December 31, 2024, we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected (i) natural gas, NGL, and condensate equity volumes in our Gathering and Processing operations that result from our percent-of-proceeds processing arrangements, (ii) future commodity purchases and sales in our Logistics and Transportation segment and (iii) natural gas transportation basis risk in our Logistics and Transportation segment. We hedge a higher percentage of our expected equity volumes in the current year compared to future years, for which we hedge incrementally lower percentages of expected equity volumes. We also enter into commodity financial instruments to help manage other short-term commodity-related business risks of our ongoing operations and in conjunction with marketing opportunities available to us in the operations of our logistics and transportation assets. With swaps, we typically receive an agreed fixed price for a specified notional quantity of commodities and we pay the hedge counterparty a floating price for that same quantity based upon published index prices. Since we receive from our customers substantially the same floating index price from the sale of the underlying physical commodity, these transactions are designed to effectively lock-in the agreed fixed price in advance for the volumes hedged. In order to avoid having a greater volume hedged than our actual equity volumes, we typically limit our use of swaps to hedge the prices of less than our expected equity volumes. We utilize purchased puts (or floors) and calls (or caps) to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk. We may buy calls in connection with swap positions to create a price floor with upside. We intend to continue to manage our exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into derivative transactions using swaps, collars, purchased puts (or floors), futures or other derivative instruments as market conditions permit.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen entering into new hedges, we intend to generally match the NGL product composition and the NGL and natural gas delivery points to those of our physical equity volumes. The NGL hedges cover specific NGL products based upon the expected equity NGL composition. We believe this strategy avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as “proxy” hedges of NGL prices. The fair values of our natural gas and NGL hedges are based on published index prices for\n \n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndelivery at various locations, which closely approximate the actual natural gas and NGL delivery points. A portion of our condensate sales are hedged using crude oil hedges that are based on the NYMEX futures contracts for West Texas Intermediate light, sweet crude.\n\n\n \n\n\nA majority of these commodity price hedges are documented pursuant to a ISDA with customized credit and legal terms. The principal counterparties (or, if applicable, their guarantors) have investment grade credit ratings. While we have no current obligation to post cash, letters of credit or other additional collateral to secure these hedges so long as we maintain our current credit rating, we could be obligated to post collateral to secure the hedges in the event of an adverse change in our creditworthiness where a counterparty’s exposure to our credit increases over the term of the hedge as a result of higher commodity prices. A purchased put (or floor) transaction does not expose our counterparties to credit risk, as we have no obligation to make future payments beyond the premium paid to enter into the transaction; however, we are exposed to the risk of default by the counterparty, which is the risk that the counterparty will not honor its obligation under the put transaction.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also enter into commodity price hedging transactions using futures contracts on futures exchanges. Exchange traded futures are subject to exchange margin requirements, so we may have to increase our cash deposit due to a rise in natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices. Unlike bilateral hedges, we are not subject to counterparty credit risks when using futures on futures exchanges.\n\n\n \n\n\nThese contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances. Generally, our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set. If prices rise above the prices at which they have been hedged, we will receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges (other than with respect to purchased calls).\n\n\n \n\n\nTo analyze the risk associated with our derivative instruments, we utilize a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the change in fair value of our derivative instruments based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying commodity prices, but does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the related hedged items. The financial statement impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in commodity price would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged item under hedge accounting. The fair values of our derivative instruments are also influenced by changes in market volatility for option contracts and the discount rates used to determine the present values.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2024:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFair Value\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nResult of 10% Price Decrease\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nResult of 10% Price Increase\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural gas\n\n\n$\n\n\n(162.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(105.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(219.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNGLs\n\n\n \n\n\n(20.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(74.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrude oil\n\n\n \n\n\n11.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(29.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$\n\n\n(172.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(20.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(323.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe table above contains all derivative instruments outstanding as of the stated date for the purpose of hedging commodity price risk, which we are exposed to due to our equity volumes and future commodity purchases and sales, as well as basis differentials related to our gas transportation arrangements.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, our operating revenues increased (decreased) by $(245.4) million and $441.1 million as a result of transactions accounted for as derivatives. The estimated fair value of our risk management position has moved from a net asset position of $74.4 million at December 31, 2023 to a net liability position of $172.2 million at December 31, 2024. The net liability position on our derivative contracts is primarily attributable to unfavorable movement in natural gas forward basis prices.\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of variable rate borrowings under the New TRGP Revolver, the Commercial Paper Program and the Securitization Facility. As of December 31, 2024, we do not have any interest rate hedges. However, we may enter into interest rate hedges in the future with the intent to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on cash flows. To the extent that interest rates increase, interest expense for the New TRGP Revolver, the Commercial Paper Program and the Securitization Facility will also increase. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.5 billion in outstanding variable rate borrowings. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points in the rate of our variable interest rate debt would impact our consolidated annual interest expense by $14.6 million based on our December 31, 2024 debt balances.\n\n\n \n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our counterparties. The credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of the asset position (i.e. the fair value of expected future receipts) at the reporting date. Our futures contracts have limited credit risk since they are cleared through an exchange and are margined daily. Should the creditworthiness of one or more of the counterparties decline, our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party. In the event of a counterparty default, we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted. We have master netting provisions in the ISDA agreements with our derivative counterparties. These netting provisions allow us to net settle asset and liability positions with the same counterparties within the same Targa entity, and would reduce our maximum loss due to counterparty credit risk by $13.4 million as of December 31, 2024. The range of losses attributable to our individual counterparties as of December 31, 2024 would be between $0.0 million and $3.8 million, depending on the counterparty in default.\n\n\n \n\n\nCustomer Credit Risk\n\n\n \n\n\nWe extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business. We have established various procedures to manage our credit exposure, including performing initial and subsequent credit risk analyses, setting maximum credit limits and terms and requiring credit enhancements when necessary. We use credit enhancements including (but not limited to) letters of credit, prepayments, parental guarantees and rights of offset to limit credit risk to ensure that our established credit criteria are followed and financial loss is mitigated or minimized.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have an active credit management process, which is focused on controlling loss exposure due to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties. Our allowance for credit losses was $2.5 million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, no customer comprised 10% or greater of our consolidated revenues.\n\n\n \n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nItem 8.

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n\n \n\n\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\n\n\n \n\n\nManagement has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 2013 to evaluate the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page F-3.\n\n\n \n\n\n/s/ Matthew J. Meloy\n\n\nMatthew J. Meloy\n\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n\n(Principal Executive Officer)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n/s/ Jennifer R. Kneale\n\n\nJennifer R. Kneale\n\n\nPresident – Finance and Administration\n\n\n(Principal Financial Officer)\n\n\n \n\n\nF-\n2\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nReport\n of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Targa Resources Corp.\n\n\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Targa Resources Corp. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in owners’ equity and series A preferred stock and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nF-\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\nValuation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\n\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the primary purpose of management’s commodity risk management activities is to manage the Company’s exposure to commodity price risk and reduce volatility in operating cash flow due to fluctuations in commodity prices. Management has entered into derivative instruments to hedge the commodity price risks. As of December 31, 2024, there were $87.1 million of assets from risk management activities and $259.3 million of liabilities from risk management activities. The fair value of the derivative instruments was determined by the use of present value methods with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets.\n\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of derivative instruments and hedging activities is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the assets and liabilities from risk management activities; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to commodity prices; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of the assets and liabilities from risk management activities, including controls over management’s model, data and assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing independent fair value estimates for a sample of the assets and liabilities from risk management activities and (ii) comparing the independent fair value estimates to management’s fair value estimates to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s fair value estimates. Developing the independent fair value estimates involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and independently developing the commodity prices assumption.\n\n\n \n\n\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\n\nHouston, Texas\n\n\nFebruary 20, 2025\n\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nF-\n4\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPART I – FINANCI\nAL INFORMATION\n\n\n \n\n\nItem 1.

footnote disclosure, the dollar amounts presented in the tabular data within these footnote disclosures are stated in millions of dollars.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote 1 — Organizati\non and Operations\n \nOur Organization\n \nTarga Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) owns, operates, acquires, and develops a diversified portfolio of complementary domestic infrastructure assets.\n \nIn this Annual Report, unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” “Targa” or “TRGP” are intended to mean our consolidated business and operations. TRGP controls the general partner of and owns all of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Targa Resources Partners LP, referred to herein as the “Partnership”. Targa consolidates the Partnership and its subsidiaries under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the rules and regulations of the SEC. Targa’s consolidated financial statements include differences from the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership. The most noteworthy differences are:\n \n•\nthe inclusion of the TRGP senior revolving credit facility and term loan facility;\n•\nthe inclusion of the TRGP senior unsecured notes;\n•\nthe inclusion of the TRGP commercial paper notes; and\n•\nthe impacts of TRGP’s treatment as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n \n \nOur Operations\n \nThe Company is primarily engaged in the business of:\n \n \n•\ngathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and purchasing and selling natural gas;\n•\ntransporting, storing, fractionating, treating, and purchasing and selling NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters; and\n•\ngathering, storing, terminaling, and purchasing and selling crude oil.\n \nSee Note 22 – Segment Information for certain financial information regarding our business segments.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote 2 — Basis\n of Presentation\n \nThese accompanying financial statements and related notes present our consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and changes in owners’ equity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n. We have prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNote 3 — Significant\n Accounting Policies\n \nConsolidation Policy\n \nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities that we control and our proportionate interest in the accounts of certain gas gathering and processing facilities in which we own an undivided interest and are responsible for our proportionate share of the costs and expenses of the facilities. Third party ownership interests in our controlled subsidiaries are presented as noncontrolling interests within the equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, except in the case of undivided interest ownership. In our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), noncontrolling interests reflect the attribution of results to third-party investors. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n \n \n\n\nF-\n11\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our consolidated joint ventures include the following:\n \n \nGathering and Processing Segment\n \n•\n60\n% ownership interest in Centrahoma Processing LLC;\n•\n55\n% ownership interest in Targa Badlands \n(see Note 4 – Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information related to Targa Badlands);\n•\n72.8\n% undivided interest in the assets of Targa Pipeline Mid-Continent WestTex LLC; and\n•\n76.8\n% ownership interest in Venice Energy Services Company, LLC.\n \nLogistics and Transportation Segment\n \n•\n80\n% ownership interest in Targa Train 7 LLC.\n \nWe apply the equity method of accounting to investments over which we exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of our investee, but do not exercise control. We evaluate our equity investments for impairment when evidence indicates the carrying amount of our investment is no longer recoverable. Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the equity method investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. When the estimated fair value of an equity investment is less than its carrying value and the loss in value is determined to be other than temporary, we recognize the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value as a non-cash pre-tax impairment loss within Equity earnings (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates include the following:\n \n \nGathering and Processing Segment\n•\n50\n% ownership interest in Little Missouri 4 LLC (“Little Missouri 4”).\n \nLogistics and Transportation Segment\n•\n50\n% ownership interest in Cayenne Pipeline, LLC (“Cayenne”);\n•\n38.8\n% ownership interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators (“GCF”); and\n•\n17.5\n% ownership interest in Blackcomb as defined in Note 4 – Acquisitions and Divestitures.\n \nUse of Estimates\n \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates and judgments are based on information available at the time such estimates and judgments are made. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Estimates and judgments are used in, among other things, (i) estimating unbilled revenues, product purchases, property, plant and equipment, operating and general and administrative cost accruals, (ii) developing fair value assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, (iii) analyzing long-lived assets for possible impairment, (iv) estimating the useful lives of assets and (v) estimating contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications.\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents\n \nCash and cash equivalents include all cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash, and have original maturities of three months or less.\n \nAllowanc\ne for Credit Losses\n \nEstimated losses on accounts receivable are provided through an allowance for credit losses. We estimate the allowance for credit losses through various procedures, including extensive review of our trade receivable balances by counterparty, assessing economic events and conditions, our historical experience with counterparties, the counterparty’s financial condition and the amount and age of past due accounts.\n \n\n\nF-\n12\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe continuously evaluate our ability to collect amounts owed to us. Receivables are considered past due if full payment is not received by the contractual due date. Our evaluation procedures also include performing account reconciliations, dispute resolution and payment confirmation.\n \n \nAs the financial condition of any counterparty changes, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to our allowance may be required.\n \nInventories\n \nOur inventories consist primarily of NGL product inventories, which are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the average cost method. Most NGL product inventories turn over monthly, but some inventory, primarily propane, is acquired and held during the year to meet anticipated heating season requirements of our customers. Commodity inventories that are not physically or contractually available for sale under normal operations (“deadstock”) are included in Property, plant and equipment.\n \nProduct Exchanges\n \nExchanges of NGL products are executed to satisfy timing and logistical needs of the exchange parties. Volumes received and delivered under exchange agreements are recorded as inventory. If the locations of receipt and delivery are in different markets, an exchange differential may be billed or owed. The exchange differential is recorded as either accounts receivable or accrued liabilities.\n \nDerivative Instruments\n \nWe utilize derivative instruments to manage the volatility of our cash flows due to fluctuating energy commodity prices. For balance sheet classification purposes, we analyze the fair values of the derivative instruments on a contract by contract basis and report the related fair values and any related collateral by counterparty on a gross basis. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as hedges are recognized in the same financial statement line item as the cash flows from the respective item being hedged.\n \nWe formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge. This documentation includes the specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the manner in which the hedging instrument’s effectiveness will be assessed. At the inception of the cash flow hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, we assess whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.\n \n \nWe record all derivative instruments at fair value with the exception of those that we apply the normal purchases and normal sales election.\n \nThe table below summarizes the accounting treatment for our derivative instruments, and the impact on our consolidated financial statements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognition and Measurement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative Treatment\n\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n\nIncome Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal Purchases and Normal Sales\n\n\nFair value not recorded\n\n\nEarnings recognized when volumes are physically delivered or received\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark-to-Market\n\n\nRecorded at fair value\n\n\nChange in fair value recognized currently in earnings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash Flow Hedge\n\n\nRecorded at fair value with changes in fair value deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”)\n\n\nThe gain/loss on the derivative instrument is reclassified out of AOCI into earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs\n\n\n\n\n \nWe will discontinue cash flow hedge accounting on a prospective basis when a hedge instrument is terminated, ceases to be highly effective or the forecasted transaction is no longer probable to occur. Gains and losses deferred in AOCI related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain deferred until the forecasted transaction occurs. If it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument in AOCI are reclassified to earnings immediately.\n\n\nF-\n13\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nFair Value Measurements\n \nWe categorize the inputs to the fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities at each balance sheet reporting date using a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the significant inputs used in measuring fair value:\n \n•\nLevel 1 – observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\n•\nLevel 2 – inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that we can directly or indirectly observe to the extent that the markets are liquid for the relevant settlement periods; and\n•\nLevel 3 – unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore we must develop our own assumptions.\n \nFor valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is categorized in Level 3. This includes derivatives valued using indicative price quotations whose contract length extends into unobservable periods.\n \nSwaps that do not have observable market prices or implied volatilities for substantially the full term of the derivative asset or liability are reported at fair value using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of these swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation technique based on a commodity forward curve, which is based on observable or public data sources and extrapolated when observable prices are not available.\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n \nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The determination of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires us to make various assumptions, including our expected use of the asset and the supply of, and demand for, hydrocarbons in the markets served, normal wear and tear of the facilities, and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs. Upon disposition or retirement of property, plant and equipment, any gain or loss is recorded to Other operating (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \nExpenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures to refurbish an asset that increases its existing service potential or prevents environmental contamination are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset or major asset component. Certain costs directly related to the construction of assets, including internal labor costs, interest and engineering costs, are capitalized.\n \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n \nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate our carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including changes to our estimates that could have an impact on our assessment of asset recoverability. Asset recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with its expected future pre-tax undiscounted cash flows. Individual assets are grouped at the lowest level for which the related identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. These cash flow estimates require us to make judgments and assumptions related to operating and cash flow results, economic obsolescence, the business climate, contractual, legal and other factors.\n \nIf the carrying amount exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flows, we recognize a non-cash pre-tax impairment loss equal to the excess of net book value over fair value. The estimated cash flows used to assess recoverability of our long-lived assets and measure fair value of our asset groups are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price and volume projections reflective of the current environment and management's projections for long-term average prices and volumes. In addition to near and long-term price assumptions, other key assumptions include volume projections, operating costs, timing of incurring such costs, and the use of an appropriate terminal value and discount rate. Any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of recoverability of our long-lived assets and the recognition of additional impairments. We believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use.\n \n\n\nF-\n14\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGoodwill\n \nGoodwill is a residual intangible asset that results when the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for impairment at least annually. This test requires us to attribute goodwill to an appropriate reporting unit, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). We evaluate goodwill for impairment on November 30 of each year, or whenever impairment indicators are present. If applicable, prior to us conducting the goodwill impairment test, we complete a review of the carrying values of our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. If it is determined that the carrying values are not recoverable, we reduce the carrying values of the long-lived assets pursuant to our policy on impairment of long-lived assets.\n \nAs part of our goodwill impairment test, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if the quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If we choose to bypass this qualitative assessment or determine that a goodwill impairment test is required, our annual goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount (including attributed goodwill). We recognize an impairment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and a corresponding reduction of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The goodwill impairment loss will not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, when measuring goodwill, we consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit, if applicable.\n \nIntangible Assets\n \nOur intangible assets include producer dedications under long-term contracts and customer relationships associated with business and asset acquisitions. The fair value of these acquired intangible assets were determined at the date of acquisition based on the present values of estimated future cash flows. We amortize the costs of our assets in a manner that closely resembles the expected benefit pattern of the intangible assets or on a straight-line basis, where such pattern is not readily determinable, over the periods in which we benefit from services provided to customers.\n \nAsset Retirement Obligations\n \nAsset retirement obligations (“AROs”) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and/or normal operation. We record a liability and increase the basis in the underlying asset for the present value of each expected ARO when there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction.\n \nFor certain assets, we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the ARO because the associated assets have indeterminate lives based on our expected continued use of the assets with proper maintenance. Assets with indeterminate useful lives include: (i) assets constructed on land owned by Targa, and (ii) active pipelines. Our intent and practice is to maintain our assets to prolong their useful lives. Management expects demand for hydrocarbons, both domestically and internationally, to exist for the foreseeable future. We record AROs for these assets in the period in which sufficient information becomes available for us to reasonably estimate the settlement dates.\n \nOur obligations are estimated based on discounted cash flow (“DCF”) estimates. Over time, the ARO liability is accreted to its present value as a period cost and the capitalized amount is depreciated over the asset’s respective useful life. At least annually, we review the projected timing and amount of AROs and reflect revisions as an increase or decrease in the carrying amount of the liability and the basis in the underlying asset. Upon settlement, we recognize any difference between the recorded amount and the actual settlement cost as a gain or loss.\n \nDebt Issuance Costs\n \nCosts incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt and any original issue discount or premium are deferred and charged to interest expense over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance costs related to revolving credit facilities and the $\n1.5\n billion unsecured term loan facility due July 2025 (the “Term Loan Facility”) are amortized on a straight-line basis and those related to long-term debt are amortized using the effective-interest method. Debt issuance costs related to revolving credit facilities are presented as other long-term assets, and debt issuance costs related to long-term debt obligations with scheduled maturities are reflected as a deduction to the carrying amount of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses on debt repurchases, redemptions and debt extinguishments include the write-off of any associated unamortized debt issuance costs.\n \n\n\nF-\n15\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Facility\n \nProceeds from the sale or contribution of certain receivables under the Partnership’s accounts receivable securitization facility (the “Securitization Facility”) are treated as collateralized borrowings in our financial statements. Proceeds and repayments under the Securitization Facility are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n \nCommercial Paper Program\n \nUnder the terms of the \nunsecured commercial paper note program (the \n“Commercial Paper Program”), we may issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes with varying maturities of less than one year.\n Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program may be issued, repaid, and re-issued from time to time, with the maximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $\n3.5\n billion, subject to documentation requirements of the Commercial Paper Program. We maintain a minimum available borrowing capacity under the \n$\n3.5\n billion TRGP senior revolving credit facility (the “New\n TRGP Revolver” as defined in Note 8 – Debt Obligations) equal to the aggregate amount outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program to support our issued commercial paper notes. The Commercial Paper Program is guaranteed by each subsidiary that guarantees the New TRGP Revolver.\n \nThe outstanding borrowings of the commercial paper program are classified as noncurrent because we have the intent and ability to refinance the borrowings on a long-term basis through the New TRGP Revolver. We confirm, on a quarterly basis, that there is sufficient liquidity under the New TRGP Revolver to refinance outstanding borrowings of the Commercial Paper Program and such liquidity is not overcommitted for other anticipated uses.\n \nAs the outstanding borrowings of the Commercial Paper Program are included as part of long-term debt (i.e., classified as noncurrent), we report Commercial Paper Program borrowings and repayments gross on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (consistent with the presentation of cash flows associated with the revolving credit facility).\n \nEnvironmental Liabilities and Other Loss Contingencies\n \nWe accrue a liability for loss contingencies, including environmental remediation costs arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources, when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\n \nIncome Taxes\n \nWe file many income tax returns with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as well as numerous states. We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax payable and related tax expense, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences can result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reported on a net basis by jurisdiction within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We report these timing differences based on statutory tax rates applicable to the scheduled timing difference reversal periods.\n \nWe assess the likelihood that we will recover our deferred tax assets from future taxable income. We establish a valuation allowance if we believe that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Any change in the valuation allowance would impact our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such a determination is made. We consider all available evidence to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, we need a valuation allowance. Evidence used includes information about our current financial position and our results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as all currently available information about future years, including our anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies.\n \nDividends\n \nPreferred and common dividends declared are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings to the extent that retained earnings was available at the close of the prior quarter, with any excess recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.\n \nComprehensive Income\n \nComprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), which includes changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges\n.\n \n\n\nF-\n16\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n \nOur operating revenues are primarily derived from the following activities:\n•\nsales of natural gas, NGLs, condensate and crude oil;\n•\nservices related to compressing, gathering, treating, and processing of natural gas; and\n•\nservices related to NGL fractionation, terminaling and storage, transportation and treating.\n \nWe have multiple types of contracts with commercial counterparties and many of these contracts contain embedded fees with settlement provisions that deduct these fees from the sales price paid by Targa in exchange for commodities. The commercial relationship of the counterparty in such contracts is inherently one of a supplier, rather than a customer, and therefore, such contracts are excluded from the provisions of the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n. Any cash inflows or fees that are realized on these supply type contracts are reported as a reduction of Product purchases and fuel.\n \nOur revenues, therefore, are measured based on consideration specified in a contract with parties designated as customers. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a commodity or service to a customer. Sales and other taxes we collect, that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing activities, are excluded from revenues.\n \nWe generally report sales revenues on a gross basis in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as we typically act as the principal in the transactions where we receive and control commodities. However, buy-sell transactions that involve purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty, which are legally contingent or in contemplation of one another, as well as other instances where we do not control the commodities, but rather are acting as an agent to the supplier, are reported as a single revenue transaction on a combined net basis.\n \nOur commodity sales contracts typically contain multiple performance obligations, whereby each distinct unit of commodity to be transferred to the customer is a separate performance obligation. Under such contracts, revenue is recognized at the point in time each unit is transferred to the customer because the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the commodity at that time. In certain instances, it may be determinable that the customer receives and consumes the benefits of each unit as it is transferred. Under such contracts, we have a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct units of commodity; and in such instance, revenue is recognized over time using the units delivered output method, as each distinct unit is transferred to the customer. Our commodity sales contracts are typically priced at a market index, but may also be set at a fixed price. When our sales are priced at a market index, we apply the allocation exception for variable consideration and allocate the market price to each distinct unit when it is transferred to the customer. The fixed price in our commodity sales contracts generally represents the standalone selling price, and therefore, when each distinct unit is transferred to the customer, we recognize revenue at the fixed price.\n \nOur service contracts typically contain a single performance obligation. The underlying activities performed by us are considered inputs to an integrated service and not separable because such activities in combination are required to successfully transfer the single overall service that the customer has contracted for and expects to receive. Therefore, the underlying activities in such contracts are not considered to be distinct services. However, in certain instances, the customer may contract for additional distinct services and therefore additional performance obligations may exist. In such instances, the transaction price is allocated to the multiple performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The performance obligation(s) in our service contracts is a series of distinct days of the applicable service over the life of the contract (fundamentally a stand-ready service), whereby we recognize revenue over time using an output method of progress based on the passage of time (i.e., each day of service). This output method is appropriate because it directly relates to the value of service transferred to the customer to date, relative to the remaining days of service promised under the contract.\n \nThe transaction price for our service contracts is typically comprised of variable consideration, which is primarily dependent on the volume and composition of the commodities delivered and serviced. The variable consideration is generally commensurate with our efforts to perform the service and the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to our efforts to satisfy each day of distinct service. Therefore, the variable consideration is typically not estimated at contract inception, but rather the allocation exception for variable consideration is applied, whereby the variable consideration is allocated to each day of service and recognized as revenue when each day of service is provided. When we are entitled to noncash consideration in the form of commodities, the variability related to the form of consideration (market price) and reasons other than form (volume and composition) are interrelated to the service, and therefore, we measure the noncash consideration at the point in time when the volume, mix and market price related to the commodities retained in-kind are known. This results in the recognition of revenue based on the market price of the commodity when the service is performed. In addition, if the transaction price includes a fixed component (i.e., a fixed capacity reservation fee), the fixed component is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the contract term, as each day of service has elapsed, which is consistent with the output method of progress selected for the performance obligation.\n \n\n\nF-\n17\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur customers are typically billed on a monthly basis, or earlier, if final delivery and sale of commodities is made prior to month-end, and payment is typically due within \n10\n to \n30 days\n. As a practical matter, we define the unit of account for revenue recognition purposes based on the passage of time ranging from one month to one quarter, rather than each day. This is because the financial reporting outcome is the same regardless of whether each day or month/quarter is treated as the distinct service in the series. That is, at the end of each month or quarter, the variability associated with the amount of consideration for which we are entitled to, is resolved, and can be included in that month or quarter’s revenue.\n \nWe have certain long-term contractual arrangements under which we have received consideration, but for which all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. These arrangements result in deferred revenue, which will be recognized over the periods that performance will be provided.\n \nWe also have certain contracts that contain provisions in which customers provide contributions in aid of construction in exchange for Targa constructing assets to fulfill the services in the contract. In general, these arrangements result in deferred revenue, which will be recognized over the contract term.\n \nWe classify our contract assets as receivables because we generally have an unconditional right to payment for the commodities sold or services performed at the end of the reporting period.\n \nWe enter into various contractual arrangements that result in the transfer of assets for \nno\n upfront compensation or cash payments, resulting in more favorable long-term contractual terms. The fair value of the assets transferred is reflected as long-term contract assets. These deferred amounts are amortized over the term of the related contract into the appropriate revenue or cost of sales accounts.\n \nShare-Based Compensation\n \nWe award share-based compensation to employees and non-employee directors in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. Compensation expense on our equity-classified awards is recorded at grant-date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized in general and administrative expense over the requisite service period of each award, and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. We may purchase a portion of the shares issued to satisfy employees’ tax withholding obligations on vested awards. These shares are recorded in treasury stock, at cost, and cash paid is classified as a financing activity in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based compensation are recognized as income tax benefit or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, with the tax effects of exercised or vested awards treated as discrete items in the reporting period which they occur. Excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n \nEarnings per Share\n \nWe calculate basic earnings (loss) per common share (“EPS”) using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation formula that determines net income (loss) per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. \nOur participating securities consist of unvested restricted stock units that vest no later than \nthree years\n following grant date as well as certain \nfour-year\n retention awards that participate in nonforfeitable dividends with the common equity owners.\n \nEPS is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders less earnings allocated to participating securities divided by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Earnings are allocated to common stock and participating securities based on the amount of dividends paid in the current period plus an allocation of the undistributed earnings to the extent that each security participates in earnings. Diluted EPS includes any dilutive effect of preferred stock, unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. The dilutive effect is calculated through the application of the two-class method. During a period of net loss or negative undistributed earnings, the two-class method is not applicable.\n \nLeases\n \nWe recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date:\n \n•\nA lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease.\n•\nA right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.\n \nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are considered short-term leases, which are excluded from the balance sheet. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the\n \n\n\nF-\n18\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncommencement date based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease prepayments and excludes lease incentives. We made an accounting policy election to combine lease and non-lease components for both arrangements in which Targa is the lessee or lessor. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate to compute the present value of our lease liability. The discount rate applied is determined based on information available on the date of adoption for all leases existing as of that date, and on the date of lease commencement for all subsequent leases.\n \nOur lease arrangements may include variable lease payments based on an index or market rate, or may be based on performance. For variable lease payments based on an index or market rate, we estimate and apply a rate based on information available at the commencement date. Variable lease payments based on performance are excluded from the calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability, and are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations when the contingency underlying such variable lease payments is resolved. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Such options are included in the measurement of our right-of-use asset and liability at commencement, provided we determine that we are reasonably certain to exercise the option.\n \n45Q Tax Credits\n \n \nWe earn tax credits under Internal Revenue Code Section 45Q through our carbon capture and sequestration activities. We recognize 45Q tax credits by analogy to the grant model within International Accounting Standard 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure Assistance, as other operating income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the volume of captured carbon sequestered and dollar value of the tax credit during the period in which captured carbon is sequestered underground. We recognize realized 45Q tax credits as a reduction to income taxes payable because the tax credits reduce Targa’s future quarterly estimated cash tax payments.\n \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n \nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n \nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.

The impact of the adoption will be limited to disclosure in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote 4\n — \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n \nDelaware Basin Acquisition\n \nIn July 2022, we completed the acquisition of all of the interests in Lucid Energy Delaware, LLC (“Lucid”) from Riverstone Holdings LLC and Goldman Sachs Asset Management for approximately $\n3.5\n billion in cash (the “Delaware Basin Acquisition”), subject to customary closing adjustments. We received a final net working capital adjustment payment of approximately $\n11.4\n million in the fourth quarter of 2022. We funded the acquisition with (i) $\n1.5\n billion in proceeds drawn under the Term Loan Facility, which was terminated in May 2024, (ii) $\n750.0\n million in aggregate principal amount of our \n5.200\n% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 (the “\n5.200\n% Notes”) and $\n500.0\n million in aggregate principal amount of our \n6.250\n% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2052 (the “\n6.250\n% Notes”) pursuant to an underwritten public offering that closed in July 2022 and (iii) $\n800.0\n million drawn on the $\n2.75\n billion senior revolving credit facility entered into with Bank of America, N.A., as the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, and Swing Line Lender, and the other lenders party thereto in February 2022 (the “Existing TRGP Revolver”). We recorded $\n16.9\n million of debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan Facility, the \n5.200\n% Notes and the \n6.250\n% Notes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 8 – Debt Obligations for further details on our financing activities.\n \nThe assets acquired in the Delaware Basin Acquisition provide natural gas gathering, treating, and processing services in the Delaware Basin, through owning and operating approximately \n1,050\n miles of natural gas pipelines and approximately \n1.4\n billion cubic feet per day (“Bcf/d”) of cryogenic natural gas processing capacity primarily in Eddy and Lea counties of New Mexico. The Delaware Basin Acquisition assets increased our footprint in the Delaware Basin and are integrated into our Permian Delaware operations.\n \n \nThe Delaware Basin Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805, \nBusiness Combinations\n, which requires, among other things, assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their fair value on the acquisition date. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities was prepared using fair value methods and assumptions, including projections of future production volumes, commodity prices, and other cash flows, market-participant assumptions (e.g., discount rate and exit multiple), expectations regarding customer contracts and relationships, tangible asset replacement costs, and other management estimates. The fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore represent Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements. These inputs require judgments and estimates at the time of a fair value assessment is required.\n \n \nThe following table summarizes the purchase price allocation based on the final fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in millions):\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n$\n\n\n9.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade receivables, net of allowances (1)\n\n\n \n\n\n211.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther current assets\n\n\n \n\n\n3.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n\n \n\n\n1,669.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntangible assets, net\n\n\n \n\n\n1,882.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther long-term assets\n\n\n \n\n\n57.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n236.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther long-term liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n100.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase price\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,495.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nThe fair value of the assets acquired included trade receivables of $\n211.0\n million. The gross amount due under contract was $\n213.4\n million, of which $\n2.4\n million was expected to be uncollectible. Trade receivables, net of allowances, excluded $\n18.5\n million that was due from Targa. We reflected this settlement of a preexisting relationship as a reduction of the purchase price in accordance with ASC 805. \n\n\nF-\n20\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe value of property, plant and equipment is determined using the cost approach and is primarily comprised of Gathering and Processing assets that will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average useful life of \n20 years\n. The associated useful lives of property, plant and equipment were based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows.\n \n \nThe value of intangible assets is comprised of customer relationships, which represent estimated value of long-term contracts with customers that will be amortized in a manner that closely resembles the expected benefit pattern of the intangible assets over an estimated useful life of \n14 years\n. The associated useful lives of intangible assets were based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. The fair value of customer relationships was determined at the date of acquisition based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using the multi-period excess earnings method. The significant assumptions used by management in determining the fair value of customer relationships intangible assets include future revenues, discount rate, and customer attrition rates.\n \nThe fair values of the tangible and intangible assets are Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the intangible assets was determined by applying a discounted cash flow approach, which utilized a discount rate of approximately \n19\n% based on our estimate of the risk that a theoretical market participant would assign to the intangible assets, and customer attrition rates of approximately \n5\n%.\n \nThe results of operations attributable to the assets and liabilities acquired in the Delaware Basin Acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements as part of our Permian Delaware operations in the Gathering and Processing segment since the date of the acquisition. Revenue and Net Income attributable to the assets acquired for the period August 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 were $\n374.1\n million and $\n7.9\n million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had incurred $\n14.4\n million of acquisition-related costs.\n \nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\n \nThe following unaudited pro forma summary presents the consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 as if the Delaware Basin Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2021. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations that would have occurred had the transaction been consummated at the beginning of the period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro Forma\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n$\n\n\n21,268.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n1,477.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe summarized unaudited pro forma information has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and reflects adjustments for the following:\n \n•\nReflects depreciation and amortization based on the fair values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, respectively. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated utilizing a straight-line approach. Intangible assets are amortized in a manner that closely resembles their expected benefit pattern;\n•\nExcludes $\n14.4\n million of acquisition-related costs incurred as of December 31, 2022 from pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2022\n;\n•\nExcludes the impact of operations previously sold by Lucid, prior to Targa’s acquisition of Lucid;\n•\nExcludes the impact of historical activity between Targa and Lucid, prior to Targa’s acquisition of Lucid;\n•\nExcludes general and administrative expense related to Lucid’s former parent company, which Targa did not acquire;\n•\nExcludes amortization of interest expense and debt issuance costs associated with Lucid’s debt, which was not assumed by Targa; \n•\nIncludes interest expense and debt issuance cost amortization associated with Targa’s borrowings to finance the Delaware Basin Acquisition; and\n•\nReflects the income tax effects of the above pro forma adjustments.\n \nSouth Texas Acquisition\n \nIn April 2022, we completed the acquisition of Southcross Energy Operating LLC and its subsidiaries (“Southcross”) for a purchase price of $\n201.9\n million (the “South Texas Acquisition”), subject to customary closing adjustments. We made a final net working capital adjustment payment of approximately $\n1.5\n million \nin the fourth quarter of 2022. We acquired a portfolio of complementary midstream\n \n\n\nF-\n21\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ninfrastructure \nassets and associated contracts that have been integrated into our SouthTX Gathering and Processing operations, including the remaining interests in the \ntwo\n joint ventures in South Texas that we previously held as investments in unconsolidated affiliates and that have been consolidated beginning in the second quarter of 2022. We accounted for the purchase as an asset acquisition and capitalized $\n1.8\n million of acquisition-related costs and assumed liabilities of $\n1.8\n million as components of the cost of assets acquired. We allocated $\n28.1\n million to our purchase of Southcross’ interest in the two joint ventures for purposes of consolidation and $\n169.7\n million, $\n3.9\n million and $\n5.3\n million of the residual cost to property, plant and equipment, current assets and liabilities, net and other non-current assets, respectively. See Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates for further discussion on South Texas Acquisition.\n \nJoint Ventures Acquisitions and Divestitures\n \nIn February 2018, we formed \nthree\n development joint ventures (“DevCo JVs”) with investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners (“Stonepeak”) to fund portions of Grand Prix NGL Pipeline (“Grand Prix”), Gulf Coast Express Pipeline (“GCX”) and a \n110\n MBbl/d fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Texas (“Train 6”). For a four-year period beginning on the date that all three projects commenced commercial operations, we had the option to acquire all or part of Stonepeak’s interests in the DevCo JVs (the “DevCo JV Call Right”). The purchase price payable for such partial or full interests was based on a predetermined fixed return or multiple on invested capital, including distributions received by Stonepeak from the DevCo JVs.\n \n \nIn January 2022, we exercised the DevCo JV Call Right and closed on the purchase of all of Stonepeak’s interests in the DevCo JVs for $\n926.3\n million (the “DevCo JV Repurchase”). Following the DevCo JV Repurchase, we owned a \n75\n% interest in the Permian to Mont Belvieu segment of Grand Prix through Grand Prix Pipeline LLC (the “Grand Prix Joint Venture”) (prior to the Grand Prix Transaction, as defined below), a \n100\n% interest in Train 6 and a \n25\n% equity interest in GCX (prior to the GCX Sale as defined below in February 2022). The changes in our ownership interests were accounted for as equity transactions representing the acquisitions of noncontrolling interests. The amount of the redemption price in excess of the carrying amount, net of tax was $\n53.2\n million, which was accounted for as a premium on repurchase of noncontrolling interests, and resulted in a reduction to Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders.\n \n \nIn May 2022, we completed the sale of Targa GCX Pipeline LLC, which held a \n25\n% equity interest in GCX, to a third party for $\n857.0\n million (the “GCX Sale”). As a result of the GCX Sale, we recognized a gain of $\n435.9\n million in Gain (loss) from sale of equity method investment in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2022. See Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates for further discussion on the GCX Sale.\n \nIn January 2023, we completed the acquisition of Blackstone Energy Partners’ \n25\n% interest in the Grand Prix Joint Venture (the “Grand Prix Transaction”) for aggregate consideration of $\n1.05\n billion in cash and a final closing adjustment of $\n41.9\n million. Following the closing of the Grand Prix Transaction, we own \n100\n% of the interest in Grand Prix. The change in our ownership interests was accounted for as an equity transaction representing the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. The amount of the redemption price in excess of the carrying amount, net of tax, was $\n490.7\n million, which was accounted for as a premium on repurchase of noncontrolling interests, and resulted in a reduction to Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders.\n \nIn December 2023, we completed the acquisition of the remaining \n50\n% membership interest in Carnero G&P LLC (“Carnero”) from our joint venture partner for cash consideration of $\n27.0\n million (the “Carnero Acquisition”). The change in our ownership interests was accounted for as an equity transaction representing the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. The amount of the consideration in excess of the carrying amount, net of tax, was $\n20.1\n million, which was accounted for as a premium on repurchase of noncontrolling interests, and resulted in a reduction to Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders.\n \nOn July 31, 2024, we entered into an agreement with WPC Parent, LLC (“WPC”) to move forward with the construction of the Blackcomb pipeline. The Blackcomb pipeline is designed to transport up to \n2.5\n Bcf/d of natural gas through approximately \n365\n miles of 42-inch pipeline from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Agua Dulce area in South Texas, and is expected to be in service in the second half of 2026, pending the receipt of customary regulatory and other approvals. The Blackcomb pipeline is held by a joint venture (“Blackcomb”), which is owned \n70.0\n% by WPC, \n17.5\n% by Targa, and \n12.5\n% by MPLX LP. WPC is a joint venture owned \n50.6\n% by WhiteWater Midstream, LLC, \n30.4\n% by MPLX LP, and \n19.0\n% by Enbridge Inc. We apply the equity method of accounting for Blackcomb. During 2024, we made capital contributions of $\n28.7\n million to Blackcomb and paid $\n1.6\n million in associated professional and legal fees. For additional information see Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates.\n \nOn December 16, 2024, we completed the acquisition of the remaining \n12\n% membership interest in Cedar Bayou Fractionators, L.P. (“CBF”) from our joint venture partner for cash consideration of $\n111.6\n million (the “CBF Acquisition”). The change in our ownership interests was accounted for as an equity transaction representing the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. The amount of the consideration in excess of the carrying amount, net of tax, was $\n32.9\n million, which was accounted for as a premium on repurchase of noncontrolling interests, and resulted in a reduction to Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders.\n\n\nF-\n22\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nOn February 18, 2025, we entered into an agreement with funds managed by Blackstone to acquire their \n45\n% interest in Targa Badlands LLC (“Targa Badlands”) for aggregate consideration of approximately $\n1.8\n billion (the “Badlands Transaction”). Following the closing of the Badlands Transaction, we will own \n100\n% of the interest in Targa Badlands.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote 5 — Property, Plant and E\nquipment and Intangible Assets\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEstimated Useful Lives (In Years)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering systems\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n11,575.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10,858.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n to \n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing and fractionation facilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9,543.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,285.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n to \n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminaling and storage facilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,469.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,403.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n to \n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransportation assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,131.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,294.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n to \n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther property, plant and equipment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n537.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n430.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n to \n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n198.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n185.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction in progress\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,702.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,456.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n401.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n351.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n to \n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty, plant and equipment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29,559.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n26,265.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation, amortization and impairment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n11,496.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n10,458.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n18,062.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,806.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntangible assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,378.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,378.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n to \n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated amortization and impairment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2,400.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2,027.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntangible assets, net\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,977.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,350.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 depreciation expense was $\n1,049.8\n million, $\n945.6\n million and $\n853.8\n million, respectively.\n \nIntangible Assets\n \nIntangible assets consist of customer contracts and customer relationships acquired in prior business combinations. The fair value of these acquired intangible assets were determined at the date of acquisition based on the present values of estimated future cash flows.

The direct and indirect effects of significant declines in commodity prices from the date of acquisition would likely cause the fair values of these reporting units to fall below their carrying values, and could result in an impairment of goodwill.\n \nAs described in Note 3 – Significant Accounting Policies, we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on November 30, or more frequently if we believe necessary based on events or changes in circumstances. For our 2024, 2023 and 2022 annual evaluations, we performed a qualitative assessment, which indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the Permian Midland and Permian Delaware reporting units were less than their carrying amounts, and therefore, a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not necessary. Our qualitative assessment considered, among other things, the overall financial performance and future outlook of the Permian Midland and Permian Delaware reporting units, industry and market considerations, and other relevant entity-specific events.\n \nThe fair value measurements utilized for the evaluation of goodwill for impairment are based on inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore represent Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements. These inputs require significant judgments and estimates at the time a fair value assessment is required.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote 7 — Investments in \nUnconsolidated Affiliates\n \nOur investments in unconsolidated affiliates consist of the following:\n \n \nGathering and Processing Segment\n•\n50\n% operated ownership interest in Little Missouri 4.\n \nLogistics and Transportation Segment\n•\n38.8\n% operated ownership interest in GCF;\n•\n50\n% operated ownership interest in Cayenne; and\n•\n17.5\n% non-operated ownership interest in Blackcomb.\n \nThe terms of these joint venture agreements do not afford us the degree of control required for consolidating the entities in our consolidated financial statements, but do afford us the significant influence required to employ the equity method of accounting.\n \nIn April 2022, we completed the South Texas Acquisition. Prior to closing the South Texas Acquisition, we had \ntwo\n operated joint ventures in South Texas: a \n75\n% interest in T2 LaSalle Gathering Company L.L.C. (“T2 LaSalle”) and a \n50\n% interest in T2 Eagle Ford Gathering Company L.L.C. (“T2 Eagle Ford” and, together with T2 LaSalle, the “T2 Joint Ventures”). Following the closing of the South Texas Acquisition, we own \n100\n% of the interest in the T2 Joint Ventures.\n \n \nIn May 2022, we completed the GCX Sale. Prior to the GCX Sale, we owned a \n25\n% non-operated ownership interest in GCX. Following the announcement of the GCX Sale in February 2022, we ceased recognizing equity earnings (loss) due to the terms of the sales agreement. As a result of the GCX Sale, we recognized a gain of $\n435.9\n million in Gain (loss) from sale of equity method investment in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2022.\n \nIn July 2024, we

As a result of the repayment, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $\n0.8\n million.\n(3)\nWe maintain the Commercial Paper Program, the borrowings of which are supported through maintaining a minimum available borrowing capacity under the New\n TRGP Revolver equal to the aggregate amount outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2024, the Existing\n \nTRGP Revolver had \nno\n borrowings outstanding and the Commercial Paper Program had $\n1,130.5\n million in borrowings outstanding, resulting in approximately $\n1,601.9\n million of available liquidity, after accounting for outstanding letters of credit.\n(4)\nWe guarantee all of the Partnership’s outstanding senior unsecured notes. \n \nThe following table shows the range of interest rates and weighted average interest rate incurred on our variable-rate debt obligations during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRange of Interest Rates Incurred\n\n\n \n\n\nWeighted Average Interest Rate Incurred\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting TRGP Revolver and Commercial Paper Program\n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n% - \n6.2\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n5.7\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecuritization Facility\n\n\n \n\n\n5.2\n% - \n6.4\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n6.1\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Loan Facility (1)\n\n\n \n\n\n6.7\n% - \n6.8\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n6.7\n%\n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nInterest rates were calculated through the redemption date of May 21, 2024.\n \n \nCompliance with Debt Covenants\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various debt agreements.\n \nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a parent guarantee whereby each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, the payment of all of the obligations of the Partnership and Targa Resources Partners Finance Corporation (together with the Partnership, the “Partnership Issuers”) under the respective indentures governing the Partnership Issuers’ senior unsecured notes.\n \n \nDebt Obligations\n \nPartnership’s Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility\n \nThe Securitization Facility provides up to $\n600.0\n million of borrowing capacity at SOFR rates plus a margin. In August 2024, the Partnership amended the Securitization Facility to, among other things, extend the termination date of the Securitization Facility to \nAugust 29, 2025\n. Under the Securitization Facility, certain Partnership subsidiaries sell or contribute certain qualifying receivables, without recourse, to another of its consolidated subsidiaries (Targa Receivables LLC or “TRLLC”), a special purpose consolidated subsidiary created for the sole purpose of the Securitization Facility. TRLLC, in turn, sells an undivided percentage ownership in the eligible receivables to third-party financial institutions. Sold or contributed receivables up to the amount of the outstanding debt under the Securitization Facility are not available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of the selling or contributing subsidiaries or the Partnership. Any excess receivables are eligible to satisfy the claims.\n \nNew TRGP Credit Agreement\n \nIn February 2025, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as the Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender, the letter of credit issuers party thereto and the other lenders party thereto (the “New TRGP Revolver”). The New TRGP Revolver provides for a revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount up to $\n3.5\n billion (with an option to increase such maximum aggregate principal amount by up to $\n500.0\n million in the future, subject to the terms of the New TRGP Revolver) and a swing line sub-facility of up to $\n150.0\n million. The New TRGP Revolver matures on \nFebruary 18, 2030\n. We will be able to extend the maturity date, subject to the required lenders’ consent, by one year up to two times.\n \nThe revolving credit facility bears interest at the Company’s option at: (a) the Base Rate (as such term is defined in the New TRGP Revolver), which is the highest of Bank of America’s prime rate, the federal funds rate plus \n0.5\n% and the Term SOFR (as such term is defined in the New TRGP Revolver) rate plus \n1.0\n% (subject in each case to a floor of \n0.0\n%), plus an applicable margin ranging from \n0.0\n% to \n0.625\n%, dependent on the Company’s non-credit-enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt ratings (or, if no such debt is outstanding at such time, then the corporate, issuer or similar rating with respect to the Company that has been most recently announced) (the “Debt Rating”), or (b) Term SOFR (which is subject to a floor of \n0.0\n% and includes, for Term SOFR loans, a SOFR adjustment of plus \n0.10\n%) plus an applicable margin ranging from \n1.00\n% to \n1.625\n%, dependent on the Company’s Debt Rating.\n \n\n\nF-\n26\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Company is required to pay a commitment fee equal to an applicable rate ranging from \n0.10\n% to \n0.275\n% (dependent on the Company’s Debt Rating), in each case times the actual daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility.\n \nThe obligations under the New TRGP Revolver are guaranteed by Targa Resources GP LLC, Targa Energy GP LLC, Targa Resources LLC, Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Energy LP, Targa GP Inc., Targa LP Inc., and Targa Resources Finance Corporation. The New TRGP Revolver shall also be guaranteed by each existing and future direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that is an obligor on or otherwise guarantees the obligations in respect of the existing notes indebtedness of Targa Resources Partners LP.\n \nThe New TRGP Revolver requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the New TRGP Revolver), determined as of the last day of each quarter for the four-fiscal quarter period ending on the date of determination, of no more than \n5.50\n to \n1.00\n. For any four-fiscal-quarter-period during which a material acquisition occurs, the total leverage ratio may, at the Company’s option, be determined on a pro forma basis as though such event had occurred as of the first day of such four-fiscal-quarter-period.\n \nThe New TRGP Revolver restricts the Company’s ability to make dividends to stockholders if an event of default (as defined in the New TRGP Revolver) exists or would result from such distribution. In addition, the New TRGP Revolver contains various covenants that may limit, among other things, the Company’s ability to grant liens, merge or consolidate, and engage in transactions with affiliates and the ability of the Company’s non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur indebtedness.\n \nThe New TRGP Revolver also contains various customary events of default, the occurrence of which could result in a termination of the lenders’ commitments and the acceleration of all of our obligations thereunder.\n \nExisting TRGP Credit Agreement\nIn February 2022, the Company entered into the Existing TRGP Revolver with Bank of America, N.A., as the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Swing Line Lender, the Letter of Credit issuers party thereto and the lenders party thereto. The Existing\n TRGP Revolver provided for a revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount up to $\n2.75\n billion (with an option to increase such maximum aggregate principal amount by up to $\n500.0\n million in the future, subject to the terms of the \nExisting \nTRGP Revolver) and a swing line sub-facility of up to $\n100.0\n million. The \nExisting \nTRGP Revolver was scheduled to mature on \nFebruary 17, 2027\n. In connection with entering into the New TRGP Revolver, we terminated the Existing TRGP Revolver.\n \nIn February 2022, TRGP and the Partnership received a corporate investment grade credit rating from Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings Inc., and in March 2022, the Partnership received a corporate investment grade credit rating from Moody’s Ratings (“Moody’s”). As a result, in accordance with the Existing TRGP Revolver, the collateral under the Existing TRGP Revolver was released from the liens securing our obligations thereunder.\n \n \nThe revolving credit facility bore interest at the Company’s option at: (a) the Base Rate (as such term is defined in the Existing\n TRGP Revolver), which is the highest of Bank of America’s prime rate, the federal funds rate plus \n0.5\n% and the Term SOFR (as such term is defined in the \nExisting\n TRGP Revolver) rate plus \n1.0\n% (subject in each case to a floor of \n0.0\n%), plus an applicable margin ranging from \n0.125\n% to \n0.75\n%, dependent on the Company’s non-credit-enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt ratings (or, if no such debt was outstanding at such time, then the corporate, issuer or similar rating with respect to the Company that had been most recently announced) (the “Debt Rating”), or (b) Term SOFR (which included, for Term SOFR loans, a SOFR adjustment of plus \n0.10\n%) plus an applicable margin ranging from \n1.125\n% to \n1.75\n%, dependent on the Company’s Debt Rating.\n \nThe Company was required to pay a commitment fee equal to an applicable rate ranging from \n0.125\n% to \n0.35\n% (dependent on the Company’s Debt Rating), in each case times the actual daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility.\n \nThe obligations under the Existing TRGP Revolver were guaranteed by certain of the domestic subsidiaries of the Company, including by the Partnership.\n \nThe Existing\n TRGP Revolver required the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated adjusted EBITDA (the “Consolidated Leverage Ratio”), determined as of the last day of each quarter for the four-fiscal quarter period ending on the date of determination, of no more than \n5.50\n to \n1.00\n.\n \n \nThe Existing TRGP Revolver restricted the Company’s ability to make dividends to stockholders if an event of default (as defined in the Existing TRGP Revolver) existed or would have resulted from such distribution. In addition, the Existing TRGP Revolver contained various covenants that may have limited, among other things, the Company’s ability to incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, make\n \n\n\nF-\n27\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ninvestments, repay or amend the terms of certain other indebtedness, merge or consolidate, sell assets, and engage in transactions with affiliates.\n \nCommercial Paper Program\n \nIn July 2022, we established the Commercial Paper Program.\n Under the terms of the Commercial Paper Program, we may issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes with varying maturities of less than one year.\n Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program may be issued, repaid and re-issued from time to time, with the maximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $\n3.5\n billion, subject to documentation requirements of the Commercial Paper Program. We maintain a minimum available borrowing capacity under the New\n TRGP Revolver equal to the aggregate amount outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program to support our issued commercial paper notes. The Commercial Paper Program is guaranteed by each subsidiary that guarantees the New TRGP Revolver. The commercial paper notes are presented in Long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \nTRGP’s Senior Unsecured Notes\n \nAll issues of our senior unsecured notes (the “TRGP Notes”) rank pari passu with our existing and future senior indebtedness, including debt issued under the New TRGP Revolver and the Commercial Paper Program, and rank senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness. The TRGP Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries that guarantee the New TRGP Revolver. Each guarantee ranks equally in right of payment with all of such guarantor’s existing and future unsecured senior debt and other unsecured guarantees of senior debt. The notes and the guarantees are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of ours or any guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Interest on all issues of TRGP Notes is payable semi-annually.\n \n \nThe indenture governing the TRGP Notes restricts (i) our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur liens and (ii) TRGP’s ability to merge or consolidate with or sell, lease, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to another company. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.\n \nWe may redeem the TRGP Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the applicable par call date at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus an applicable make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the redemption date, as specified in the indenture of each series. After the applicable par call date, the TRGP Notes may be redeemed at a price equal to par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, as specified in the indenture of each series.\n \nIn the future, we may redeem, purchase or exchange certain of our outstanding debt through redemption calls, cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such calls, repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\n \nPartnership’s Senior Unsecured Notes\n \nAll issues of the Partnership’s senior unsecured notes are pari passu with the Partnership’s existing and future senior indebtedness. They are senior in right of payment to any of the Partnership’s future subordinated indebtedness and are unconditionally guaranteed by the Partnership’s restricted subsidiaries. These notes are effectively subordinated to all secured indebtedness under the Securitization Facility, which is secured by accounts receivable pledged under the facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. Interest on all issues of senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually in arrears.\n \nThe Partnership’s senior unsecured notes and associated indenture agreements restrict, among other things, (i) the Partnership’s ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to incur liens and (ii) the Partnership’s ability to merge or consolidate with or sell, lease, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to another company. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.\n \nThe Partnership may redeem its senior unsecured notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their applicable maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus an applicable make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidation damages, if any, to the redemption date, as specified in the indenture of each series.\n \nThe Partnership may also redeem up to \n35\n% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of its senior unsecured notes at the redemption dates and prices set forth in the indenture governing such series plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidation damages, if any, to the redemption date with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, provided that: (i) at least \n65\n% of the aggregate principal amount of each such notes (excluding notes held by the Partnership and its subsidiaries) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and (ii) the redemption occurs within \n180\n days of the date of the closing of such equity offering.\n\n\nF-\n28\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nIn the future, we or the Partnership may redeem, purchase or exchange certain of our and the Partnership’s outstanding debt through redemption calls, cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such calls, repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\n \nSenior Unsecured Notes Issuances\n \n \nIn April 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of (i) $\n750.0\n million aggregate principal amount of our \n4.200\n% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2033 (the “\n4.200\n% Notes”) and (ii) $\n750.0\n million aggregate principal amount of our \n4.950\n% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2052 (the “\n4.950\n% Notes”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $\n1.5\n billion. The \n4.200\n% Notes and the \n4.950\n% Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by our subsidiaries that guarantee the New TRGP Revolver, so long as such subsidiary guarantors satisfy certain conditions.

A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance was used to fund the concurrent cash tender offer (the “March Tender Offer”) and the subsequent redemption of the Partnership’s \n5.875\n% Senior Unsecured Notes due April 2026 (the “\n5.875\n% Notes”), with the remainder of the net proceeds used for repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the \nExisting TRGP Revolver. See “Debt Repurchases and Extinguishments” for further details of the March Tender Offer.\n \nIn July 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of the \n5.200\n% Notes and the \n6.250\n% Notes, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $\n1.2\n billion. The \n5.200\n% Notes and the \n6.250\n% Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by our subsidiaries that guarantee the New TRGP Revolver, so long as such subsidiary guarantors satisfy certain conditions.

We used the net proceeds from the issuance to fund a portion of the Delaware Basin Acquisition.\n \nIn January 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of (i) $\n900.0\n million aggregate principal amount of our \n6.125\n% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2033 (the “\n6.125\n% Notes”) and (ii) $\n850.0\n million aggregate principal amount of our \n6.500\n% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2053 (the “January 2023 \n6.500\n% Notes”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $\n1.7\n billion. The \n6.125\n% Notes and the January 2023 \n6.500\n% Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by our subsidiaries that guarantee the New TRGP Revolver, so long as such subsidiary guarantors satisfy certain conditions.

We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance to fund the Grand Prix Transaction and the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to reduce borrowings under the \nExisting TRGP Revolver and the Commercial Paper Program.\n \n \nIn November 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of (i) $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of our \n6.150\n% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2029 (the “2023 \n6.150\n% Notes”) and (ii) $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of our \n6.500\n% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2034 (the “November 2023 \n6.500\n% Notes”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $\n2.0\n billion. The 2023 \n6.150\n% Notes and the November 2023 \n6.500\n% Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by our subsidiaries that guarantee the New TRGP Revolver, so long as such subsidiary guarantors satisfy certain conditions.

We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay $\n1.0\n billion in borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to repay borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program.\n \n \nIn August 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of our \n5.500\n% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2035 (the “\n5.500\n% Notes”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $\n990.1\n million. The \n5.500\n% Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by our subsidiaries that guarantee the New TRGP Revolver, so long as such subsidiary guarantors satisfy certain conditions. The \n5.500\n% Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of April 6, 2022, as supplemented by that certain Ninth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 9, 2024, among us, each subsidiary guarantor and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. We used the net proceeds from the issuance to repay borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program, a portion of which were incurred to repay the remaining balance under the Term Loan Facility, and for general corporate purposes.\n \n\n\nF-\n29\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDebt Repurchases & Extinguishments\n \nIn February 2022, in connection with entering into the Existing TRGP Revolver, we terminated the previous TRGP senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Previous TRGP Revolver”) and the Partnership’s senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Partnership Revolver”).\n As a result of the termination of the Previous TRGP Revolver and the Partnership Revolver, we recorded a loss of $\n0.8\n million due to a write-off of debt issuance costs.\n \nThe Partnership redeemed all of the outstanding \n5.375\n% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 (the “5.375% Notes”) in \nMarch 2022\n with available liquidity under the \nExisting\n TRGP Revolver. As a result of the redemption of the 5.375% Notes, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $\n15.0\n million comprised of $\n12.6\n million of premiums paid and a write-off of $\n2.4\n million of debt issuance costs.\n \n \nConcurrent with the \n4.200\n% Notes and the \n4.950\n% Notes offering, we commenced the March Tender Offer to redeem subject to certain terms and conditions, any and all of the Partnership’s outstanding \n5.875\n% Notes. As a result of the March Tender Offer and the subsequent redemption of the 5.875% Notes, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $\n33.8\n million comprised of $\n29.3\n million of premiums paid and a write-off of $\n4.5\n million of debt issuance costs in April 2022.\n \nIn November 2023, in connection with the 2023 \n6.150\n% Notes and November 2023 \n6.500\n% Notes, we repaid borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the Commercial Paper Program.\n As a result of the repayment of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, we recorded a loss of $\n2.1\n million due to a write-off of debt issuance costs.\n \nIn May 2024, we repaid the Term Loan Facility, which bore interest at the Company’s option at: (a) the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Facility), which was the highest of the (i) federal funds rate plus \n0.5\n%, (ii) Mizuho’s prime rate, and (iii) the Term SOFR (as defined in the Term Loan Facility) rate plus \n1.0\n% (subject in each case to a floor of \n0.0\n%), plus an applicable margin ranging from \n0.125\n% to \n0.75\n% dependent on the Company’s non-credit-enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt ratings (or, if no such debt is outstanding at such time, then the Debt Rating), or (b) Term SOFR plus \n0.10\n% plus an applicable margin ranging from \n1.125\n% to \n1.75\n% dependent on the Debt Rating. As a result of the repayment, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $\n0.8\n million.\n \nThe following table shows the contractually scheduled maturities of our debt obligations outstanding at \nDecember 31, 2024, for the next five years, and in total thereafter:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nScheduled Maturities of Debt\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting TRGP Revolver and Commercial Paper Program\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,130.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,130.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRGP Senior unsecured notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,500.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n750.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,000.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,750.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartnership’s Senior unsecured notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,034.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n705.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n700.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n679.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,949.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecuritization Facility\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n330.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n330.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n13,994.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n330.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,585.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n700.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,679.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,699.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNote 9 — Other \nLong-term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities are comprised of the following obligations:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n119.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n248.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset retirement obligations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n177.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n103.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating lease liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n90.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n56.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal other long-term liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n392.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n415.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nF-\n30\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDeferred Revenue\n \nDeferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n119.9\n million and $\n248.8\n million, respectively. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023\n included $\n129.0\n million in payments received from Vitol Americas Corp. (“Vitol”) (formerly known as Noble Americas Corp.), a subsidiary of Vitol US Holding Co., in 2016, 2017, and 2018 as part of an agreement (the “Splitter Agreement”) related to the construction and operation of a crude oil and condensate splitter. In December 2018, Vitol elected to terminate the Splitter Agreement. As a result of a legal ruling in April 2024, the $\n129.0\n million in payments from Vitol were reclassified to Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets during the first quarter of 2024. On April 26, 2024, we made a cash payment of $\n184.8\n million which included cumulative interest on the award of $\n55.8\n million to Vitol in satisfaction of the Texas state court judgment. See Note 17 - Contingencies for more information.\n \nDeferred revenue includes contributions in aid of construction received from customers for which revenue is recognized over the expected contract term and contributions received for other construction activities of facilities connected to our systems. Deferred revenue also includes consideration received in 2015 and 2017 amendments to a gas gathering and processing agreement.

The difference between the consideration paid of $\n973.4\n million (including unpaid dividends of $\n8.2\n million) and the net carrying value of the shares redeemed was $\n223.7\n million, of which $\n215.5\n million was recorded as deemed dividends in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the second quarter of 2022. Following the redemption, we have no Series A Preferred outstanding and all rights of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred were terminated.\n \nPreferred Stock Dividends\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $\n51.8\n million of dividends to Series A Preferred Shareholders.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote 12 — Ea\nrnings per Common Share\n \nIn March 2023, the Compensation Committee amended the Restricted Stock Units Grant Agreements that govern the Restricted Stock Unit awards (“RSUs”) that vest no later than three years following the RSUs’ grant date. The amendment resulted in quarterly cash dividend payments to RSU holders beginning with the common stock dividend paid in May 2023. As the amended RSUs and certain four-year retention awards participate in nonforfeitable dividends with the common equity owners of the Company, they are considered participating securities.\n \nWe calculate earnings per share using the two-class method. Earnings are allocated to common stock and participating securities based on the amount of dividends paid in the current period plus an allocation of the undistributed earnings to the extent that each security participates\n \nin earnings.\n\n\nF-\n34\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income and weighted average shares outstanding used in computing basic and diluted net income per common share:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp.\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,312.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,345.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,195.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Premium on repurchase of noncontrolling interests, net of tax (1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n510.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n53.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Dividends on Series A Preferred Stock (2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Deemed dividends on Series A Preferred Stock (3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n215.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareholders\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,279.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n835.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n896.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess:\n \nParticipating share-based earnings (4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income (loss) allocated to common shareholders for basic earnings per share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,269.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n828.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n896.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n220.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n224.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n227.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDilutive effect of unvested restricted stock awards\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n221.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n226.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n231.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income (loss) available per common share - basic\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5.77\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.69\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.95\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income (loss) available per common share - diluted\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5.74\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.66\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.88\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nRepresents premium paid on the CBF Acquisition, Grand Prix Transaction, Carnero Acquisition and the DevCo JV Repurchase.

See Note 11 – Common Stock and Related Matters for further discussion.\n\n\n \n\n\nNot\ne 13 — Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n \nThe primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to manage our exposure to commodity price risk and reduce volatility in our operating cash flow due to fluctuations in commodity prices. We have entered into derivative instruments to hedge the commodity price risks associated with a portion of our expected (i) natural gas, NGL, and condensate equity volumes in our Gathering and Processing operations that result from percent-of-proceeds processing arrangements, (ii) future commodity purchases and sales in our Logistics and Transportation segment and (iii) natural gas transportation basis risk in our Logistics and Transportation segment. The hedge positions associated with (i) and (ii) above will move favorably in periods of falling commodity prices and unfavorably in periods of rising commodity prices and are primarily designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.\n \nThe hedges generally match the NGL product composition and the NGL delivery points of our physical equity volumes. Our natural gas hedges are a mixture of specific gas delivery points and Henry Hub. The NGL hedges may be transacted as specific NGL hedges or as baskets of ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane and natural gasoline based upon our expected equity NGL composition. We believe this approach avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as “proxy” hedges of NGL prices. Our natural gas and NGL hedges are settled using published index prices for delivery at various locations.\n \nWe hedge a portion of our condensate equity volumes using crude oil hedges that are based on the NYMEX futures contracts for West Texas Intermediate light, sweet crude, which approximates the prices received for condensate. This exposes us to a market differential risk if the NYMEX futures do not move in exact parity with the sales price of our underlying condensate equity volumes.\n \nWe also enter into derivative instruments to help manage other short-term commodity-related business risks and take advantage of market opportunities. We have not designated these derivatives as hedges and record changes in fair value and cash settlements to revenues in current earnings.\n \n\n\nF-\n35\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nAt \nDecember 31, 2024, the notional volumes of our commodity derivative contracts were:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity\n\n\nInstrument\n\n\nUnit\n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Gas\n\n\nSwaps\n\n\nMMBtu/d\n\n\n \n\n\n82,428\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n81,604\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,971\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Gas\n\n\nBasis Swaps\n\n\nMMBtu/d\n\n\n \n\n\n482,370\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n242,500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n208,329\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n55,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNGL\n\n\nSwaps\n\n\nBbl/d\n\n\n \n\n\n29,695\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28,753\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,770\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNGL\n\n\nFutures\n\n\nBbl/d\n\n\n \n\n\n10,422\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n411\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondensate\n\n\nSwaps\n\n\nBbl/d\n\n\n \n\n\n7,814\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,249\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,208\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nOur derivative contracts are subject to netting arrangements that permit our contracting subsidiaries to net cash settle offsetting asset and liability positions with the same counterparty within the same Targa entity.

We maintain a margin deposit with the brokers in an amount sufficient to cover the fair value of our open futures positions. The margin deposit is considered collateral, which is located within Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not offset against the fair value of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments other than our futures contracts are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements (“ISDAs”), which govern the key terms with our counterparties. Our ISDAs contain credit-risk related contingent features. Following the release of the collateral securing our Existing TRGP Revolver, our derivative positions are no longer secured. As of December 31, 2024, we have outstanding net derivative positions that contain credit-risk related contingent features that are in a net liability position of \n$\n138.2\n million. We have not been required to post any collateral related to these positions due to our credit rating. If our credit rating was to be downgraded one notch below investment grade by both Moody’s and S&P, as defined in our ISDAs, we estimate that as of December 31, 2024\n, we would \nno\nt be required to post collateral to any counterparties and that no counterparty could request immediate, full settlement per the terms of our ISDAs.\n \nThe fair value of our derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, was determined by the use of present value methods or standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. The estimated fair value of our derivative instruments was a net liability of \n$\n172.2\n million as of December 31, 2024. The estimated fair value is net of an adjustment for credit risk based on the default probabilities as indicated by market quotes for our counterparties’ credit default swap rates. The credit risk adjustment was immaterial for all periods presented. Our futures contracts that are cleared through an exchange are margined daily and do not require any credit adjustment.\n \n\n\nF-\n37\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following tables reflect amounts recorded in OCI and amounts reclassified from OCI to revenue:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGain (Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives (Effective Portion)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivatives in Cash Flow\n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHedging Relationships\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity contracts\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n7.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n193.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n5.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGain (Loss) Reclassified from OCI into Income (Effective Portion)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation of Gain (Loss)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n67.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n153.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n373.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, we expect to reclassify commodity hedge related deferred gains of \n$\n19.1\n million included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings before income taxes over the next twelve months. However, actual amounts reclassified into earnings could be greater or less than the net amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Based on valuations as of \nDecember 31, 2024, the maximum length of time over which we have hedged our exposure to the variability in future cash flows is through December 2027.\n \nOur consolidated earnings are also affected by the use of the mark-to-market method of accounting for derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or that have not been designated as hedges. The changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and through earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than being deferred until the anticipated transaction settles. \nThe use of mark-to-market accounting for financial assets and liabilities (“financial instruments”) can cause non-cash earnings volatility due to changes in the underlying commodity price indices. For the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024, the unrealized mark-to-market losses are primarily attributable to unfavorable movements in natural gas forward basis prices, as compared to our positions.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLocation of Gain (Loss)\n\n\n \n\n\nGain (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivatives\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivatives Not Designated\n\n\n \n\n\nRecognized in Income on\n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nas Hedging Instruments\n\n\n \n\n\nDerivatives\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity contracts\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenue\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n313.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n287.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n381.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \nSee Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements and Note 22 – Segment Information for additional disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote \n14 — Fair Value Measurements\n \nUnder GAAP, our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect a mixture of measurement methods for financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other financial instruments are reported at historical cost or amortized cost on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following are additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding fair value measurements of our financial instruments.\n \nFair Value of Derivative Financial Instruments\n \nOur derivative instruments consist of financially settled commodity swaps, futures, option contracts and fixed-price forward commodity contracts with certain counterparties. We determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using present value methods or standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and we believe we have obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative instruments we hold.\n \nThe fair values of our derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in forward pricing on natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. The derivatives at December 31, 2024, represent a net liability position of \n$\n172.2\n million, and reflects the present value, adjusted for counterparty credit risk, of the amount we expect to receive or pay in the future on our derivative instruments. If forward pricing on natural gas, NGLs and crude oil were to increase by 10%, the result would be a fair value reflecting a net liability of \n$\n323.6\n million. If forward pricing on natural gas, NGLs and crude oil were to decrease by 10%, the result would be a fair value reflecting a net liability of \n$\n20.8\n million.\n \n\n\nF-\n38\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFair Value of Other Financial Instruments\n \nDue to their cash or near-cash nature, the carrying value of other financial instruments included in working capital (i.e., cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable) approximates their fair value. Long-term debt is primarily the other financial instrument for which carrying value could vary significantly from fair value. We determined the supplemental fair value disclosures for our current and long-term debt as follows:\n \n•\nthe Existing TRGP Revolver, commercial paper notes, Securitization Facility and Term Loan Facility are based on carrying value, which approximates fair value as their interest rates are based on prevailing market rates; and\n•\nthe TRGP senior unsecured notes and the Partnership’s senior unsecured notes are based on quoted market prices derived from trades of the debt.\n \nFair Value Hierarchy\n \nThe following table shows a breakdown by fair value hierarchy category for (i) financial

We and the Partnership are also parties to various proceedings with governmental environmental agencies, including, but not limited to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, New Mexico Environment Department, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, which assert monetary sanctions for alleged violations of environmental regulations, including air emissions, discharges into the environment and reporting deficiencies, related to events that have arisen at certain of our facilities in the ordinary course of our business.\n \n\n\nF-\n40\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOn \nDecember 26, 2018\n, Vitol filed a lawsuit in the 80th District Court of Harris County (the “District Court”), Texas against Targa Channelview LLC, then a subsidiary of the Company (“Targa Channelview”), seeking recovery of $\n129.0\n million in payments made to Targa Channelview, additional monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. Vitol alleged that Targa Channelview breached the Splitter Agreement, which provided for Targa Channelview to construct a crude oil and condensate splitter (the “Splitter”) adjacent to a barge dock owned by Targa Channelview to provide services contemplated by the Splitter Agreement. In January 2018, Vitol acquired Noble Americas Corp. and on December 23, 2018, Vitol voluntarily elected to terminate the Splitter Agreement claiming that Targa Channelview failed to timely achieve start-up of the Splitter. Vitol’s lawsuit also alleged Targa Channelview made a series of misrepresentations about the capability of the barge dock that would service crude oil and condensate volumes to be processed by the Splitter and Splitter products. Vitol sought return of $\n129.0\n million in payments made to Targa Channelview prior to the start-up of the Splitter, as well as additional damages. On the same date that Vitol filed its lawsuit, Targa Channelview filed a lawsuit against Vitol seeking a judicial determination that Vitol’s sole and exclusive remedy was Vitol’s voluntarily termination of the Splitter Agreement and, as a result, Vitol was not entitled to the return of any prior payments under the Splitter Agreement or other damages as alleged. Targa also sought recovery of its attorneys’ fees and costs in the lawsuit.\n \nOn \nOctober 15, 2020\n, the District Court awarded Vitol $\n129.0\n million (plus interest) following a bench trial. In addition, the District Court awarded Vitol $\n10.5\n million in damages for losses and demurrage on crude oil that Vitol purchased for start-up efforts. The Company appealed the award in the Fourteenth Court of Appeals in Houston, Texas. In October 2020, we sold Targa Channelview but, under the agreements governing the sale, we retained the liabilities associated with the Vitol proceedings. On September 13, 2022, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals upheld the trial court’s judgment in part with regard to the return of Vitol’s prior payments, but modified the judgment to delete Vitol’s ability to recover any damages related to losses or demurrage on crude oil. We filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court of Texas, which was denied on October 20, 2023. We then filed a petition for rehearing with the Supreme Court of Texas, which was denied on April 19, 2024. As a result of the April 2024 ruling, the $\n129.0\n million in payments from Vitol were reclassified from Other long-term liabilities to Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets during the first quarter of 2024.\n \n \nThe cumulative interest on the award of $\n55.8\n million was recorded in Interest expense, in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2024\n. On April 26, 2024 as a result of the final determination of Targa’s appeal to the Texas Supreme Court related to the Splitter Agreement, we made a cash payment of $\n184.8\n million to Vitol in satisfaction of the Texas state court judgment. See Note 9 – Other Long-term Liabilities.\n \nOn July 24, 2023, we received a Notice of Violation (“NOV”) from the New Mexico Environment Department (“NMED”), Air Quality Bureau, relating to alleged air permit violations at the Red Hills gas processing facility. The alleged air permit violations occurred primarily between August 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022, while these facilities were owned by Lucid, an entity we acquired in July 2022 and whose assets are now integrated into Targa Northern Delaware LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On December 5, 2024, we received a proposed Administrative Compliance Order (“ACO”) from the NMED relating to the violation identified in the NOV and certain other alleged violations. The ACO includes a proposed civil penalty of approximately $\n47.8\n million and requires certain capital improvements to address the operations and excess air emissions at the Red Hills processing facility\n.\n These capital improvements, totaling approximately $\n140\n million, were substantially completed by December 31, 2024.\n \n \nOn January 3, 2025, we filed a Request for Hearing with the NMED with respect to the ACO. We have cooperated with the NMED in identifying and correcting legacy environmental issues since our acquisition of Lucid, and we expect to continue to engage with the NMED to resolve this matter. Although this matter is ongoing and we cannot predict its ultimate outcome, we believe we have valid defenses to many of the NMED allegations and intend to vigorously defend this matter.\n \n \nOn \nOctober 26, 2023\n, we received a final judgment in a lawsuit alleging a breach of contract related to the major winter storm in February 2021. The damages awarded against us are approximately $\n6.9\n million, not including pre-judgment interest. Both parties are appealing the judgment.\n \nWe were named as defendants in other breach of contract cases related to force majeure events arising during the major winter storm in February 2021. While it is not possible to predict the total ultimate losses with respect to these cases, we believe that aggregate losses up to $\n10.0\n million are reasonably possible.\n \nIn April 2024, we received an administrative NOV from the EPA and a request for the production of documents from the United States Attorney’s Office for North Dakota relating to alleged violations of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), at certain Targa Badlands LLC compressor stations. The NOV and subpoena stem from inspections the EPA conducted at the compressor stations on June 15, 2023, as well as related records reviews. In October 2024, we began negotiations with the U.S. Attorney’s Office with respect to resolution of a single-count information alleging a violation of the CAA related to untimely installation of monitoring equipment at \none\n compressor station, which carries a maximum fine of $\n500,000\n, \nand we entered into a Plea Agreement on December 16, 2024 reflecting these terms. We have also entered into discussions with the EPA with respect to a proposed Consent Agreement and Final Order that would resolve\n \n\n\nF-\n41\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthe \nallegations contained in the NOV by requiring, among other things, payment of an administrative penalty. Although these matters are ongoing and we cannot predict their ultimate outcome, we do not expect resolution of these matters will be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n \n\n\nNote 18\n — \nRevenue\n \nFixed consideration allocated to remaining performance obligations\n \nThe following table presents the estimated minimum revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the reporting period, and is comprised of fixed consideration primarily attributable to contracts with minimum volume commitments, for which a guaranteed amount of revenue can be calculated.

We\n \n\n\nF-\n42\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nare responding to information requests from the IRS with respect to these audits. We do not expect there to be any audit adjustments that would materially change our taxable income.\n \nFederal statutes of limitations for returns filed in 2021 (for calendar year 2020) have expired. The 2019 returns under examination have a statute extension to December 2025. The statute of limitations expired on substantially all 2020 state income tax returns that were filed prior to October 15, 2021. For Texas, the statute of limitations has expired for 2020 returns (for calendar year 2019). However, tax authorities could review and adjust carryover attributes (e.g., net operating losses (“NOLs”)) generated in a closed tax year if utilized in an open tax year.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, we have total U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $\n4.7\n billion and tax credit carryforwards of $\n3.9\n million. The NOL carryforwards do not expire, but are limited to offsetting \n80\n% of taxable income per year. \nThe tax credit carryforwards expire in 2044.\n As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, our tax effected valuation allowance was $\n5.9\n million, a decrease of $\n1.2\n million from \nDecember 31, 2023\n. Of this valuation allowance, $\n5.2\n million is federal and the remaining $\n0.7\n million is state.\n \nSet forth below is the reconciliation between our Income tax provision (benefit) computed at the United States statutory rate on income before income taxes and the income tax provision (benefit) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax reconciliation:\n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,938.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,942.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,663.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n241.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n233.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n335.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome attributable to Targa Resources Corp. before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n1,696.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,709.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,327.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal statutory income tax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for federal income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n356.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n358.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n278.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nValuation allowance\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n29.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n177.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState income taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n\n\n \n\n\n36.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn-to-provision\n\n\n \n\n\n2.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n5.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in income tax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n12.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermanent adjustments\n\n\n \n\n\n7.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock compensation shortfall/(windfall)\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n13.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n15.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n6.3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther, net\n\n\n \n\n\n8.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n\n\n$\n\n\n384.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n363.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n131.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nWe have not identified any uncertain tax positions. We believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Therefore, \nno\n reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded.\n \nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) which, among other things, introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax (the “CAMT”), imposed a \n1\n% excise tax on stock buybacks and tax incentives to promote clean energy. Under the CAMT, a \n15\n% minimum tax will be imposed on certain financial statement income of “applicable corporations.” The IRA treats a corporation as an applicable corporation in any taxable year in which the “average annual adjusted financial statement income” of such corporation for the three taxable year period ending prior to such taxable year exceeds $\n1\n billion.\n \nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS have issued guidance on the application of the CAMT, including proposed regulations issued in September 2024, which may be relied upon until final regulations are issued. Based on our interpretation of the IRA, the CAMT and related guidance, and several operational, economic, accounting and regulatory assumptions, we are currently not an “applicable corporation”, but we are likely to become one in a subsequent year, potentially as early as 2026. If we become an applicable corporation and our CAMT liability is greater than our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for any particular tax year, the CAMT liability would effectively accelerate our future U.S. federal income tax obligations, reducing our cash available for distribution in that year, but provide an offsetting credit against our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for the future. As a result, our current expectation is that the impact of the CAMT is limited to timing differences in future tax years. Given the complexities of the IRA and the CAMT, we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential future impact to our financial statements.\n\n\n \n\n\nF-\n43\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNote 20 — S\nupplemental Cash Flow Information\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest paid, net of capitalized interest (1)\n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n712.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n618.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n401.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome taxes paid, net of refunds\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-cash investing activities:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in deadstock commodity inventory\n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n3.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n13.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n3.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact of net accruals on capital expenditures\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n221.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n58.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n60.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in ARO liability and property, plant and equipment, net due to revised cash flow estimate and additions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-cash financing activities:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in accrued distributions to noncontrolling interests\n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n3.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n8.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n26.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduction of owner's equity related to accrued dividends on unvested equity awards under share compensation arrangements\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-cash distributions to noncontrolling interests (2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease liabilities arising from recognition of right-of-use assets:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating lease\n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n66.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n53.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n9.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance lease (3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n59.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n104.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n220.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nInterest capitalized on major projects was $\n74.8\n million, $\n41.1\n million and $\n16.3\n million for the years ended December 31, \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n. \n(2)\nRepresents the transfer of an undivided interest in certain gas gathering and processing facilities to a joint owner upon Targa\n’\ns recovery of a specified payout amount for our initial full funding of the facilities.\n(3)\nThe December 31, 2022 amount includes $\n171.2\n million related to compressor leases from the Delaware Basin Acquisition that were subsequently amended and extended.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNote 21 — Co\nmpensation Plans\n \n2010 Targa Resources Corp. Stock Incentive Plan\n \nIn December 2010, we adopted the Targa Resources Corp. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2010 TRGP Plan”) for employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company. In May 2017, the 2010 TRGP Plan was amended and restated. In August 2023, the 2010 TRGP Plan was amended and restated for a second time. Total authorized shares of common stock under the plan is \n15,000,000\n, comprised of \n5,000,000\n shares originally available and an additional \n10,000,000\n shares that became available in May 2017. The 2010 TRGP Plan allows for the grant of (i) incentive stock options qualified as such under U.S. federal income tax laws (“Incentive Options”), (ii) stock options that do not qualify as Incentive Options (“Non-statutory Options,” and together with Incentive Options, “Options”), (iii) stock appreciation rights granted in conjunction with Options or Phantom Stock Awards, (iv) restricted stock awards, (v) phantom stock awards, (vi) bonus stock awards, (vii) performance unit awards, or (viii) any combination of such awards.\n \n \nUnless otherwise specified, the compensation costs for the awards listed below were recognized as expense over related vesting periods based on the grant-date fair values, reduced by forfeitures incurred.\n \nRestricted Stock Awards\n - Restricted stock entitles the recipient to cash dividends. Dividends on unvested restricted stock will be accrued when declared and recorded as short-term or long-term liabilities, dependent on the time remaining until payment of the dividends, and paid in cash when the award vests. Upon issuance, the restricted stock awards will be included in the outstanding shares of our common stock. The Compensation Committee of the Targa board of directors (the “Compensation Committee”) awarded our common stock to our outside directors. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we issued \n23,984\n, \n23,518\n and \n31,117\n shares of director grants with weighted average grant-date fair values of $\n85.70\n, $\n74.13\n and $\n56.32\n, respectively.\n \n \nRestricted Stock Units Awards –\n RSUs are similar to restricted stock, except that shares of common stock are not issued until the RSUs vest. The vesting periods generally vary from one to six years. In March 2023, the Compensation Committee amended the Restricted Stock Units Grant Agreements that govern the RSUs that vest no later than three years following the RSUs’ grant date. The amendment resulted in quarterly cash dividend payments to RSU holders beginning with the common stock dividend paid in May 2023. In 2024, 2023 and 2022\n, we issued \n415,467\n, \n587,326\n and \n943,352\n shares of RSUs with weighted average grant-date fair values of $\n117.95\n, $\n78.69\n and $\n63.87\n, respectively.\n \n \n\n\nF-\n44\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table summarizes the restricted stock awards and RSUs under the 2010 TRGP Plan in shares and in dollars for the year indicated.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNumber\nof shares\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWeighted Average\nGrant-Date Fair Value\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,307,796\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n57.84\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n439,451\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n116.19\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n74,733\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67.55\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n902,462\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42.06\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,770,052\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n79.96\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nPerformance Share Units\n \nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we granted \n131,816\n, \n140,020\n and \n173,011\n performance share units (“PSUs”) to executive management for the \n2024, 2023 and 2022\n compensation cycle that will vest/have vested in \nJanuary 2027\n, \nJanuary 2026\n and \nJanuary 2025\n. The PSUs granted under\n the 2010 TRGP Plan are \nthree-year\n equity-settled awards linked to the performance of shares of our common stock. The awards also include dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”) that are based on the notional dividends accumulated during the vesting period.\n \nThe vesting of the PSUs is dependent on the satisfaction of a combination of certain service-related conditions and the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the members of a specified comparator group of publicly-traded midstream companies (the “LTIP Peer Group”) measured over designated periods. For the PSUs granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024, the TSR performance factor is determined by the Compensation Committee based on relative TSR over a cumulative three-year performance period. The Compensation Committee determines a guideline performance percentage for the performance period and the percentage may then be decreased or increased by the Compensation Committee at its discretion. The grantee will become vested in a number of PSUs equal to the target number awarded multiplied by the TSR performance factor, and vested PSUs will be settled by the issuance of Company common stock. The value of DERs will be paid in cash when the awards vest.\n \nCompensation cost for equity-settled PSUs was recognized as an expense over the performance period based on fair value at the grant date. The compensation cost will be reduced if forfeitures occur. Fair value was calculated using a simulated share price that incorporates peer ranking. DERs associated with equity-settled PSUs were accrued over the performance period as a reduction of owners’ equity. We evaluated the grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and historical volatility assumption with an expected term of \nthree years\n. The expected volatilities were \n34\n%, \n38\n% and \n80\n% for PSUs granted in \n2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \nThe following table summarizes the PSUs under the 2010 TRGP Plan in shares and in dollars for the years indicated.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNumber\nof shares\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWeighted Average\nGrant-Date Fair Value\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n596,300\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n85.78\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n131,816\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n147.66\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n4,625\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n143.14\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n310,397\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n56.36\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n413,094\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n126.99\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nStock Compensation Expense\n \nStock compensation expense under our plans totaled $\n63.2\n million, $\n62.4\n million and $\n57.5\n million for the \nyears ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Our reportable segments include operating segments that have been aggregated based on the nature of the products and services provided.\n \n \nOur Gathering and Processing segment includes assets used in the gathering and/or purchase and sale of natural gas produced from oil and gas wells, removing impurities and processing this raw natural gas into merchantable natural gas by extracting NGLs; and assets used for the gathering and terminaling and/or purchase and sale of crude oil. The Gathering and Processing segment’s assets are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico (including the Midland, Central and Delaware Basins); the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Barnett Shale in North Texas; the Anadarko, Ardmore, and Arkoma Basins in Oklahoma (including the SCOOP and STACK) and South Central Kansas; the Williston Basin in North Dakota (including the Bakken and Three Forks plays); and the onshore and near offshore regions of the Louisiana Gulf Coast.\n \nOur Logistics and Transportation segment includes the activities and assets necessary to convert mixed NGLs into NGL products and also includes other assets and value-added services such as transporting, storing, fractionating, terminaling, and marketing of NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters and certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of our other businesses. The Logistics and Transportation segment also includes Grand Prix, which connects our gathering and processing positions in the Permian Basin, Southern Oklahoma and North Texas with our Downstream facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Our Downstream facilities are located predominantly in Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas, and in Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n \nOther contains the unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses related to derivative contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges. Elimination of inter-segment transactions are reflected in the corporate and eliminations column.\n \nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the \nChief Executive Officer\n. \nThe Company’s CODM assesses the segments’ performance by using each segment’s operating margin.
