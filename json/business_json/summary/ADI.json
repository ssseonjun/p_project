  "item1_summary": " Analog Devices is a global semiconductor leader dedicated to solving our customers’ most complex engineering challenges . The Intelligent Edge is characterized by ubiquitous sensing, hyper-scale and edge computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and pervasive connectivity . We have positioned our business to capitalize on these long-term growth opportunities and to deliver innovative solutions across industries .\n We are committed to realizing targeted shareholder value creation from acquisitions to complement our R&D and drive long-term value creation . We strive to be the destination for the world’s best engineering talent, with a team of approximately 13,000 engineers . We believe that our engineering talent continues to be an important competitive differentiator in the semiconductor space .\n We incorporate AI capabilities across our technologies, business operations, products and services to enhance performance and drive smarter, more efficient solutions . Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol ADI . Our fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in October .\n Analog Devices has included our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as an inactive textual reference . We intend to disclose on our website any amendments to, or waivers from, our code of business conduct and ethics that are required to be publicly disclosed pursuant to rules of the SEC or Nasdaq. available in print and free of charge to any shareholder of Analog Devices who requests it.\n Analog and mixed-signal IC technology have been the foundation of our business for six decades . We are one of the world’s largest suppliers of high-performance analog ICs . We believe that the principal advantages these products have as compared to competitors’ products include higher accuracy, higher speed, smaller size, lower power consumption .\n Our strategic goal is to bridge the domains of analog and mixed-signal, digital and embedded and AI and software technologies to enable intelligent systems that can sense, process and respond to real-world conditions . Our product offerings include more than 75,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) that can be aggregated into the following general categories .\n Our analog product line also includes a broad portfolio of high-performance RF and microwave ICs covering the entire RF signal chain . Our analog technology portfolio is comprised of sensor and actuator products, including products based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology . Digital Signal Processing and System Products are optimized for high-speed numeric calculations .\n Programmable DSPs are designed to provide flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and inexpensively using software . DSP IC customers typically write their own algorithms using software development tools provided by us and third-party suppliers . In fiscal 2025, we also launche a new open-source embedded development platform, CodeFusion Studio 2.0 .\n d Power Studio, a digital simulation and design ecosystem integrating new system-level and IC-level design capabilities into a single product family . Together, the Power Studio family of products is designed to enable faster time to market by streamlining power management design and optimization . We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website .\n We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services . From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies, or move customers to a direct support or fulfillment model . These distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products . Some of them also sell products that compete with our products, including those for which we are an alternate source .\n The breakdown of our annual revenue by end market is set out in the table below . The industrial market includes the following sectors: Industrial Automation, Automotive, Communications and Consumer . We are a leader in industrial automation demonstrated through our delivery of robust, high-performance solutions derived from our expertise in deep motion and process control and precision sensing .\n Trusted measurement is at the forefront of innovation . We enable high performance measurement through our components and system solutions . Our industrial automation market includes applications such as:Condition-based monitoring (CbM) and industrial robotics . Our high-voltage, isolation and precision products are a key part of the systems that are designed for safety, longevity and efficiency in electric vehicles and renewable energy .\n The healthcare market is evolving in response to the need for increased access to better and more affordable care, as well as a growing focus on preventative healthcare . Most of our products sold in this market are specially tested versions of products derived from our standard product offering . As end systems are becoming more complex, many of our customers look for us to provide higher levels of integration in order to minimize size, weight and power .\n Drive towards improved energy efficiency, conservation, reliability and clean energy is driving investments in electrification across many different application areas, including electric vehicle charging infrastructure, renewable energy, power transmission and distribution systems, electric meters and other innovative areas . We develop high-performance signal processing technologies that enable intelligent, efficient and immersive mobility solutions across electrification, digital cabin systems and autonomous platforms .\n The demand for ubiquitous global connectivity continues to drive the need for wireless network infrastructure . Wireless technology relies on the conversion and processing of signals in both analog and digital domains to transmit and receive data over the air . Our high-performance RF and mixed-signal products are designed to deliver higher speed connectivity with lower latency and improved energy efficiency .\n The emergence of feature-rich consumer products has created a market for our high-performance ICs with a high level of specific functionality that enables best in class user experience and battery management . These products include: Portable devices (smartphones, tablets, handheld gaming and wearable technology) for media and vital signs monitoring applications .\n Sales are subject to a varying degree of seasonality . Historically, sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter have been lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers . We believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability, supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support, enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers’ competitiveness in our chosen markets ."
