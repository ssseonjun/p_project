  "item1_summary": " AT&T Inc. (“AT&T,” “we” or the “Company”) is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1983 . We maintain an internet website at www.att.com . We file electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required reports .\n AT&T Inc. as SBC Communications Inc. (SBC) was formed as one of several regional holding companies . SBC was spun-off from ATTC pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly traded telecommunications services provider . In 2005, we merged one of our subsidiaries with ATTC, creating one of the world’s leading telecommunications providers .\n In September 2024, we agreed to sell our remaining interest in DIRECTV to TPG, which we expect to close in mid-2025 . In April 2022, we completed the separation of our WarnerMedia business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction) Upon its separation and distribution, the Warner media business met the criteria for discontinued operations, as did other dispositions that were part of a single plan .\n AT&T is a leader in providing connectivity services through our market focus areas of 5G and fiber . Fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver, both wired and wireless . Streaming, augmented reality, “smart” technologies, user generated content and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to continue to drive greater demand for broadband . We believe our fixed wireline and mobile approach will differentiate our services .\n During 2025, we are focused on the core capabilities of our products, our infrastructure and our network . We plan for about 70% of our wireless network traffic to flow across open-capable platforms by late 2026 . We believe the move to an open, agile, programmable wireless network positions us to quickly capitalize on the next generation of wireless technology and spectrum when it becomes available .\n The increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with 5G technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services . We expect to continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity . We participate in FCC spectrum auctions and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support more advanced mobile internet services .\n In 2020, we identified fiber as a core priority for our business and enhanced our focus to expand our fiber footprint and grow customers . At December 31, 2024, we had more than 9.3 million fiber consumer wireline broadband customers, adding 1.0 million during the year . Our exit strategy includes migrating customers to fiber and wireless alternatives, and working with policy-makers to decommission our inefficient and less reliable copper network .\n AT&T provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally . The Communications segment provided approximately 97% of 2024 segment operating revenues and accounted for substantially all of our 2024 total segment operating income . As of December 31, 2024, we served 118 million Mobility subscribers, including 89 million postpaid (73 million phone), 19 million prepaid and 10 million through resellers .\n An increasing number of our subscribers are using more advanced devices, including embedded computing systems and/or software, commonly called the Internet of Things (IoT) We offer unlimited plans that include features allowing for the sharing of voice, text and data across multiple devices . We also offer nationwide wireless voice and data communications to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance .\n Historically, a majority of our Business Wireline service revenues came from legacy copper-based voice and data and traditional products . We will focus on our owned and operated connectivity services powered by 5G and fiber as well as evaluating opportunities where we can turn down existing copper infrastructure . Consumer Wireline provides broadband services, including fiber connections, AIA and legacy telephony voice communication services, to customers in the United States .\n We provide services to approximately 14.1 million subscribers at December 31, 2024 . The company is expanding its network to provide high-tech broadband to the world's largest cities . The network will continue to expand its network as a result of increased demand for high-speed internet services in the U.S. and abroad .\n We provide postpaid and prepaid wireless services in Mexico to approximately 24 million subscribers under the AT&T and Unefon brands . We sell a wide variety of handsets, including smartphones manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services . The following table sets forth the percentage of total consolidated reported operating revenues by any class of service that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated total operating revenues .\n The FCC’s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high-quality, innovative services our customers demand . Wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period, typically 10 to 15 years, and we must seek renewal of these licenses . The Communications Act of 1934 and other related laws give the FCC broad authority to regulate the U.S. operations of our interstate telecommunications services .\n Certain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents, trademarks, trademarks and other intellectual property necessary to conduct service . At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to regulatory scrutiny . We have also sought to minimize and/or moderate regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive communications market .\n We periodically license third-party patents and other intellectual rights in exchange for payments . We also receive claims from third parties asserting that our products, services or technologies infringe on their patents or other intellectual property rights . We do not believe resolution of any of these infringement claims would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations .\n The desire for high-speed data on demand, including video, is continuing to lead customers to terminate their traditional wired or copper-based services . In most U.S. markets, we compete for customers with large cable companies and wireless broadband providers . We continue to lose legacy voice and data subscribers due to industry-wide secular declines .\n The majority of the development activities are performed to create new services and to invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers . Research and development expenses were $955 in 2024, $954 in 2023, and $1,236 in 2022 . As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 140,990 persons .\n Approximately 43% of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA) The main contract set to expire in 2025 covers approximately 9,000 employees in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas . After expiration of collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached .\n AT&T is committed to inclusion and one of the reasons why our company purpose is “to connect people to greater possibilities.” This emanates from our unwavering pledge to ensure that employees feel included, valued, and are fully engaged in our success. AT &T believes in attracting and hiring talented people who represent a mix of backgrounds and experiences ."
