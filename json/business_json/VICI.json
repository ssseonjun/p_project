For a summary of our financing activities in 2024 refer to “Summary of Significant 2024 Activity - Financing and Capital Markets Activity” above\n.\nCovenants\nOur debt obligations are subject to certain customary financial and operating covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional debt, sell certain assets and restrict certain payments, among other things. In addition, these covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications, including, with respect to the restricted payments covenant, the ability to make unlimited restricted payments to maintain our REIT status.\nAt December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all required debt-related covenants, including financial covenants.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that have a significant level of estimation uncertainty, requiring our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, and significantly impacts the Balance Sheets and Statement of Operations in the reporting period. Actual results may differ from the estimates. Refer to \nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n for a full discussion of our accounting policies. \n51\nTable of Contents\nLease Accounting\nWe account for our investments in leases under ASC 842 “Leases” (“ASC 842”), which requires us to use significant estimates and judgment in applying the accounting standard. Upon lease inception or lease modification, we assess the lease classification of the different components of the property, generally land and building, to determine whether each component should be classified as a direct financing, sales-type or operating lease. The determination of lease classification requires the calculation of the rate implicit in the lease, which is driven by (i) significant judgments around the inclusion of renewal terms in the non-cancelable lease period and whether such renewal terms are reasonably certain to be exercised and (ii) the estimation of both the value assigned to the land and building property components upon acquisition and the estimation of the unguaranteed residual value of such components at the end of the lease term. If the lease component is determined to be a direct financing or sales-type lease, revenue is recognized over the life of the lease using the rate implicit in the lease. \nWe use industry standard practices to estimate both the value assigned to the land and building property components upon acquisition and the unguaranteed residual value of such components, including comparable sales and replacement cost analyses. Although we believe our estimate of both the value assigned to the land and building property components upon acquisition and the unguaranteed residual value of such components is reasonable, no assurance can be given that such amounts will be correct. In particular a change in the estimates could have a material impact on the lease classification determination and the timing and amount of income recognized over the life of the lease. \nAllowance for Credit Losses\nASC 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” (“ASC 326”) requires that we measure and record current expected credit losses (“CECL”) for the majority of our investments, the scope of which includes our Investments in leases - sales-type, Investments in leases - financing receivables and Investments in loans. We have elected to use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the Allowance for credit losses, or CECL allowance for our leases. This model requires us to develop cash flows that project estimated credit losses over the life of the lease and discount these cash flows at the investment’s effective interest rate. We then record a CECL allowance equal to the difference between the amortized cost basis of the investment and the present value of the expected credit loss cash flows.\nExpected losses within our cash flows are determined by estimating the probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) of our tenants and their parent guarantors over the life of each individual lease or financial asset. The PD and LGD are estimated during a reasonable and supportable period for which we believe we are able to estimate future economic conditions (the “R&S Period”) and a long-term period for which we revert to long-term historical averages (the “Long-Term Period”). We are unable to use our historical data to estimate losses as we have no loss history to date. \nGiven the length of our leases, the Long-Term Period PD and LGD are the most material and significant drivers of the CECL allowance. The PD and LGD for the Long-Term Period are estimated using the average historical default rates and historical loss rates, respectively, of public companies over the past 40 years that have similar credit profiles or characteristics to our tenants and their parent guarantors. We have engaged a nationally recognized data analytics firm to assist us with estimating both the PD and LGD of our tenants and their parent guarantors. Changes to the Long-Term Period PD and LGD are generally driven by (i) updated studies from the nationally recognized data analytics firm we employ to assist us with calculating the allowance and (ii) changes in the credit rating assigned to our tenants and their parent guarantors. \nThe following table illustrates the impact on the CECL allowance of our investment portfolio as a result of a 10% increase and decrease in the weighted average percentages used to estimate Long-Term PD and LGD of all of our tenants and their parent guarantors. Refer to \nNote 5 - Allowance\n \nfor Credit Losses\n for further information on our CECL Allowance and related balances as of December 31, 2024. \n($ in thousands)\nLong-Term PD\nLong-Term LGD\nChange\nChange in CECL Allowance %\nChange in CECL Allowance $\nChange in CECL Allowance %\nChange in CECL Allowance $\n10% increase\n0.21 \n%\n$\n91,990 \n0.25 \n%\n$\n110,597 \n10% decrease\n(0.21)\n%\n$\n(93,927)\n(0.25)\n%\n$\n(110,602)\nAlthough management believes its estimate of the Long-Term PD and LGD described above is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the Long-Term PD and LGD for our tenants, or other drivers of the CECL allowance, will be correct. Any significant variation of Long-Term PD or LGD from management’s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. \n52\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flows. To achieve this objective, our consolidated subsidiaries primarily borrow on a fixed-rate basis for longer-term debt issuances. As of December 31, 2024, we had $17.1 billion of aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, of which 99.0% has a fixed interest rate and 1.0% has a variable interest rate, representing the US$148.8 million outstanding balance under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility (denominated in CAD and GBP). As of December 31, 2024, a one percent increase or decrease in the annual interest rate on our variable rate borrowings would increase or decrease our annual cash interest expense by approximately $1.5 million using the applicable exchange rate as of December 31, 2024.\nAdditionally, we are exposed to interest rate risk between the time we enter into a transaction and the time we finance the related transaction with long-term fixed-rate debt. In addition, when long-term debt matures, we may have to refinance such debt at a higher interest rate. In a heightened interest rate environment, we have from time to time and may in the future seek to mitigate that risk by utilizing forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, U.S. Treasury rate lock agreements and other derivative instruments. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control.\nCapital Markets Risks\nWe are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets, and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or other equity instruments. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through long-term indebtedness, borrowings under credit facilities or other debt instruments. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing, and terms of capital we raise.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. Foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest, thereby providing a natural hedge. We continuously evaluate our foreign currency risk and may in the future use derivative financial instruments, such as currency exchange swaps, foreign currency collars, and foreign currency forward contracts with financial counterparties to further mitigate such risk. \nITEM 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe financial statements required by this item and the reports of the independent accountants thereon required by Item 15. - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this Form 10-K appear on pages F-2 to F-52. See accompanying \nIndex to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n on page F-1.\nITEM 9.\nChanges in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nITEM 9A.\nControls and Procedures\nVICI Properties Inc.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nVICI maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods, and is accumulated and communicated to VICI’s management, including VICI’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n53\nTable of Contents\nVICI’s management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of VICI’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \nBasis for Opinion\n \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Credit Losses — Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description \nThe Company applies Accounting Standard Codification Topic 326 - \nFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses\n to measure and record current expected credit losses (“CECL”) using a discounted cash flow model for its sales-type leases and lease financing receivables. This model requires the Company to develop cash flows which are used to project estimated credit losses over the life of the sales-type lease and lease financing receivable, and discount these cash flows at the lease’s effective interest rate. \nExpected losses within the Company’s cash flows are determined by estimating the probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) of its tenants and their parent guarantors over the life of each sales-type lease and lease financing receivable by using a model from an independent third-party provider. The PD and LGD are estimated during a reasonable and supportable period which is developed by using the current financial condition of the tenants and their parent guarantors and applying it to a projection of economic conditions over a two-year term. The PD and LGD are also estimated for a long-term period by using the average historical default rates and historical loss rates of public companies that have similar credit profiles or characteristics to the Company’s tenants and their parent guarantors. Significant inputs to the Company’s forecasting methods \nF - 2\nTable of Contents\ninclude the tenants’ short-term and long-term PD and LGD based on the tenant’s and their parent guarantor’s credit profile related to sales-type leases and lease financing receivables. \nGiven the significant amount of judgment required by management to estimate the short-term and long-term PD and LGD, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimated allowance for credit losses on sales-type leases and lease financing receivables required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased effort, including the need to involve our credit specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the allowance for credit losses for the Company’s sales-type leases and lease financing receivables included the following, among others: \n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the allowance for credit losses, including management’s controls over the data used in the model. \n•\nWith the assistance of our credit specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the model’s methodology, which includes PD and LGD assumptions.  \n•\nWe tested the inputs used to determine the short-term and long-term PD of the tenants and their parent guarantors by agreeing the respective credit rating and equity value of each entity to independent data. \n•\nWe reconciled the cash flow inputs used in the CECL model by agreeing them to the respective contractual agreements.\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 20, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2016.\nF - 3\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of VICI Properties Inc. \nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of VICI Properties Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO. \nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 20, 2025 \nF - 4\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n \nTo the Partners of VICI Properties L.P. and the Board of Directors of VICI Properties Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VICI Properties L.P. and subsidiaries (the \"Partnership\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, partners' capital, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\").

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 20, 2025 \nF - 7\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets\nReal estate portfolio:\nInvestments in leases - sales-type, net\n$\n23,581,101\n \n$\n23,015,931\n \nInvestments in leases - financing receivables, net\n18,430,320\n \n18,211,102\n \nInvestments in loans and securities, net\n1,651,533\n \n1,144,177\n \nLand\n150,727\n \n150,727\n \nCash and cash equivalents\n524,615\n \n522,574\n \nOther assets\n1,030,644\n \n1,015,330\n \nTotal assets\n$\n45,368,940\n \n$\n44,059,841\n \nLiabilities\nDebt, net\n$\n16,732,889\n \n$\n16,724,125\n \nAccrued expenses and deferred revenue\n217,956\n \n227,241\n \nDividends and distributions payable\n461,954\n \n437,599\n \nOther liabilities\n1,004,340\n \n1,013,102\n \nTotal liabilities\n18,417,139\n \n18,402,067\n \nCommitments and contingent liabilities (Note 10)\nStockholders’ equity\nCommon stock, $\n0.01\n par value, \n1,350,000,000\n shares authorized and \n1,056,366,685\n and \n1,042,702,763\n shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively \n10,564\n \n10,427\n \nPreferred stock, $\n0.01\n par value, \n50,000,000\n shares authorized and \nno\n shares outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023\n—\n \n—\n \nAdditional paid-in capital\n24,515,417\n \n24,125,872\n \nAccumulated other comprehensive income\n144,574\n \n153,870\n \nRetained earnings\n1,867,400\n \n965,762\n \nTotal VICI stockholders’ equity\n26,537,955\n \n25,255,931\n \nNon-controlling interests\n413,846\n \n401,843\n \nTotal stockholders’ equity\n26,951,801\n \n25,657,774\n \nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity\n$\n45,368,940\n \n$\n44,059,841\n \n_______________________________________________________\nNote: \nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Investments in leases - sales-type, Investments in leases - financing receivables, Investments in loans and Other assets (sales-type sub-leases) are net of $\n802.7\n million, $\n737.1\n million, $\n25.0\n million and $\n20.6\n million, respectively, and $\n701.1\n million, $\n703.6\n million, $\n29.8\n million, and $\n18.7\n million, respectively, of Allowance for credit losses.

AND VICI PROPERTIES L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words the “Company,” “VICI,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to VICI Properties Inc. and its subsidiaries, including  VICI Properties L.P. (“VICI LP”), on a consolidated basis, unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise. \nWe refer to (i) our Consolidated Financial Statements as our “Financial Statements,” (ii) our Consolidated Balance Sheets as our “Balance Sheets,” (iii) our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as our “Statement of Operations,” and (iv) our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as our “Statement of Cash Flows.” References to numbered “Notes” refer to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 1 — \nBusiness and Organization \nWe are a Maryland corporation that is primarily engaged in the business of owning and acquiring gaming, hospitality, wellness, entertainment and leisure destinations, subject to long-term triple net leases. As of December 31, 2024, we own \n93\n experiential assets across a geographically diverse portfolio consisting of \n54\n gaming properties and \n39\n other experiential properties across the United States and Canada, including Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand and the Venetian Resort Las Vegas (the “Venetian Resort”). Our gaming and entertainment facilities are leased to leading brands that seek to drive consumer loyalty and value with guests through superior services, experiences, products and continuous innovation. VICI also owns \nfour\n championship golf courses which are managed by Cabot-Managed Properties and are located near certain of our properties.\nVICI, the parent company, is a Maryland corporation and internally managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our real property business, which represents the substantial majority of our assets, is conducted through VICI Properties OP LLC (“VICI OP”) and indirectly through VICI LP and our golf course business, VICI Golf LLC (“VICI Golf”), is conducted through a direct wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) of VICI. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute substantially all of our net taxable income to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT.\n \nNote 2 — \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and with the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\n \nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Non-controlling Interest\nThe accompanying Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of VICI LP, and the subsidiaries in which we or VICI LP has a controlling interest. All intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We consolidate all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest and variable interest entities for which we or one of our consolidated subsidiaries is the primary beneficiary. \nNon-controlling Interests\nWe present non-controlling interests and classify such interests as a component of consolidated stockholders’ equity or partners’ capital, separate from VICI stockholders’ equity and VICI LP partners’ capital. As of December 31, 2024, VICI’s non-controlling interests were comprised of (i) approximately \n1.1\n% third-party ownership of VICI OP in the form of a limited liability company interest in VICI OP (“VICI OP Units”), (ii) a \n20\n% third-party ownership of Harrah’s Joliet Landco LLC, the entity that owns the Harrah’s Joliet facility and is the lessor under the related lease agreement with Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (together with, as the context requires, its subsidiaries, “Caesars”) for such facility (the “Caesars Joliet Lease”) and (iii) a \nF - 18\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC. AND VICI PROPERTIES L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nminority third-party equity interest, in the form of Class A Units, of VICI Bowl HoldCo LLC (“Lucky Strike OP Units”), the entity that (a) owns the portfolio of bowling entertainment centers leased to Lucky Strike Entertainment Corporation (“Lucky Strike Entertainment” and formerly known as Bowlero Corporation) and (b) is the lessor under the related Lucky Strike master lease agreement, which interest entitles the non-controlling interest holder to a preferred return that currently approximates \n4.2\n% of the entity’s cash flows.\nVICI LP’s non-controlling interests are the third-party ownership interests in Harrah’s Joliet Landco LLC and VICI Bowl HoldCo LLC referenced above.\nReportable Segments\nOur operations consist of real estate investment activities, which represent substantially all of our business. The operating results are regularly reviewed, on a consolidated basis, by the chief operating decision maker and are considered to be \none\n operating segment. Accordingly, all operations have been considered to represent \none\n reportable segment.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash consists of cash-on-hand and cash-in-bank. Highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did \nno\nt have any restricted cash. \nShort-Term Investments\nInvestments with an original maturity of greater than three months and less than one year from the date of purchase are considered short-term investments and are stated at fair value. \nWe may invest our excess cash in short-term investment grade commercial paper as well as discount notes issued by government-sponsored enterprises including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and certain of the Federal Home Loan Banks. These investments generally have original maturities between 91 and 180 days and are accounted for as available for sale securities. Interest on our short-term investments is recognized as interest income in our Statement of Operations.\n We did \nno\nt have any short-term investments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nPurchase Accounting\nWe assess all of our property acquisitions under ASC 805 “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”) to determine if such acquisitions should be accounted for as a business combination or an asset acquisition. Under ASC 805, an acquisition does not qualify as a business combination when (i) substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets or (ii) the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or (iii) the acquisition does not include an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay. Generally, and to date, all of our acquisitions have been determined to be asset acquisitions and, in accordance with ASC 805-50, all applicable transaction costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price of the acquisition.\nWe allocate the purchase price, including the costs incurred to acquire the assets, to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as applicable, using their relative fair value. Generally, the assets acquired are comprised of land, building and site improvements and in certain instances, such as our acquisition of MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”) and the acquisition of the joint venture that holds the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (“MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV”), existing leases and/or debt. Further, since all the components of our leases are classified as sales-type leases or financing receivables, as further described below, the assets acquired are transferred into the net investment in lease or financing receivable, as applicable.\n \nInvestments in Leases - Sales-type, Net\nWe account for our investments in leases under ASC 842 “Leases” (“ASC 842”). Upon lease inception or lease modification, we assess lease classification to determine whether the lease should be classified as a direct financing, sales-type or operating lease. As required by ASC 842, we separately assess each lease component of the property, generally comprised of land and building, to determine the classification. If the lease component is determined to be a direct financing or sales-type lease, we record a net investment in the lease, which is equal to the sum of the lease receivable and the unguaranteed residual asset, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. Any difference between the fair value of the asset and the net investment in the lease is considered selling profit or loss and is either recognized upon execution of the lease or deferred and recognized over the life \nF - 19\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC.

Since we purchase properties and simultaneously enter into new leases directly with the tenants, the net investment in the lease is generally equal to the purchase price of the asset, and, due to the long-term nature of our leases, the land and building components of an investment generally have the same lease classification. \nInvestments in Leases - Financing Receivables, Net\nIn accordance with ASC 842, for transactions in which we enter into a contract to acquire an asset and lease it back to the seller under a lease classified as a sales-type lease (i.e., a sale leaseback transaction), control of the asset is not considered to have transferred to us. As a result, we do not recognize the net investment in the lease but instead recognize a financial asset in accordance with ASC 310 “Receivables” (“ASC 310”); however, the accounting for the financing receivable under ASC 310 is materially consistent with the accounting for our investments in leases - sales-type under ASC 842. \nLease Term\nWe assess the noncancelable lease term under ASC 842, which includes any reasonably certain renewal periods. All of our lease agreements provide for an initial term, with \none\n or more tenant renewal options. \nIn relation to our gaming assets and certain other irreplaceable real estate, we generally conclude that the lease term includes all of the periods covered by extension options as it is reasonably certain our tenants will renew the lease agreements. In these situations, we believe our tenants are economically compelled to renew the lease agreements due to the importance of our real estate to the operation of their business, the significant capital they have invested and are required to invest in our properties under the terms of the lease agreements and the lack of suitable replacement assets. \nIncome from Leases and Lease Financing Receivables\nWe recognize the related income from our sales-type leases and lease financing receivables on an effective interest basis at a constant rate of return over the terms of the applicable leases. As a result, the cash payments accounted for under sales-type leases and lease financing receivables will not equal income from our lease agreements. Rather, a portion of the cash rent we receive is recorded as Income from sales-type leases or Income from lease financing receivables, loans and securities, as applicable, in our Statement of Operations and a portion is recorded as a change to Investments in leases - sales-type, net or Investments in leases - financing receivables, net, as applicable. \nInitial direct costs incurred in connection with entering into investments classified as sales-type leases are included in the balance of the net investment in the lease. Such amounts will be recognized as a reduction to Income from investments in leases over the life of the lease using the effective interest method. Costs that would have been incurred regardless of whether the lease was signed, such as legal fees and certain other third-party fees, are expensed as incurred to Transaction and acquisition expenses in our Statement of Operations. \nLoan origination fees and costs incurred in connection with entering into investments classified as lease financing receivables are included in the balance of the net investment and such amounts will be recognized as an adjustment to Income from investments in loans and lease financing receivables over the life of the lease using the effective interest method.\nInvestments in Loans and Securities, net\nInvestments in loans are held-for-investment and are carried at historical cost, inclusive of unamortized loan origination costs and fees and net of allowances for credit losses. Income is recognized on an effective interest basis at a constant rate of return over the life of the related loan. \nWe classify our investments in securities on the date of acquisition of the investment as either trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. We classify our debt securities as held-to-maturity, as we have the intent and ability to hold this security until maturity, the accounting of which is materially consistent with that of our Investments in loans.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nASC 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” (“ASC 326”) requires that we measure and record current expected credit losses (“CECL”) for the majority of our investments, the scope of which includes our Investments in leases - sales-type, Investments in leases - financing receivables and Investments in loans and securities. \nF - 20\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC. AND VICI PROPERTIES L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nInvestments in Leases\nIn relation to our lease portfolio, we have elected to use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the allowance for credit losses, or CECL allowance for our Investments in leases - sales-type and Investments in leases - financing receivables, which comprise the substantial majority of our CECL allowance. This model requires us to develop cash flows which project estimated credit losses over the life of the lease and discount these cash flows at the investment’s effective interest rate. We then record a CECL allowance equal to the difference between the amortized cost basis of the investment and the present value of the expected credit loss cash flows.\nExpected losses within our cash flows are determined by estimating the probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) of our tenants and their parent guarantors, as applicable, over the life of each individual lease or financial asset. We have engaged a nationally recognized data analytics firm to assist us with estimating both the PD and LGD of our tenants and their parent guarantors, as applicable. The PD and LGD are estimated during a reasonable and supportable period for which we believe we are able to estimate future economic conditions (the “R&S Period”) and a long-term period for which we revert to long-term historical averages (the “Long-Term Period”). The PD and LGD estimates for the R&S Period are developed using the current financial condition of the tenant and parent guarantor, as applicable, and applied to a projection of economic conditions over a \ntwo-year\n term. The PD and LGD for the Long-Term Period are estimated using the average historical default rates and historical loss rates, respectively, of public companies over approximately the past 40 years that have similar credit profiles or characteristics to our tenants and their parent guarantors, as applicable. We are unable to use our historical data to estimate losses as we have no loss history to date. \nInvestments in Loans\nIn relation to our loan portfolio, we engage a nationally recognized data analytics firm to provide loan level market data and a forward-looking commercial real estate loss forecasting tool. The credit loss model generates the PD and LGD using sub-market loan-level data and the fair value of collateral to generate net operating income and forecast the expected loss for each loan. \nUnfunded Commitments\nWe are required to estimate a CECL allowance related to contractual commitments to extend credit, such as future funding commitments under a revolving credit facility, delayed draw term loan, construction loan or through commitments made to our tenants to fund the development and construction of improvements at our properties. We estimate the amount that we will fund for each contractual commitment based on (i) discussions with our borrowers and tenants, (ii) our borrowers’ and tenants’ business plans and financial condition and (iii) other relevant factors. Based on these considerations, we apply a CECL allowance to the estimated amount of credit we expect to extend. The CECL allowance for unfunded commitments is calculated using the same methodology as the allowance for the respective investments subject to the CECL model. The CECL allowance related to these future commitments is recorded as a component of Other liabilities on our Balance Sheets.\nPresentation\nThe initial CECL allowance is recorded as a reduction to our net Investments in leases - sales-type, Investments in leases - financing receivables, Investments in loans and securities and Sales-type sub-leases (included in Other assets) on our Balance Sheets. We are required to update our CECL allowance on a quarterly basis with the resulting change being recorded in the Statement of Operations for the relevant period. Finally, each time we make a new investment in an asset subject to ASC 326, we are required to record an initial CECL allowance for such asset, which results in a non-cash charge to the Statement of Operations for the relevant period.\nWrite-offs of our investments in leases and loans are deducted from the allowance in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when received. There were no charge-offs or recoveries for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nRefer to \nNote 5 - Allowance for Credit Losses\n for further information.\nF - 21\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC. AND VICI PROPERTIES L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nInvestments in Land\nOur investments in land are held at historical cost and comprised of the following:\n•\nLas Vegas Land.\n We own certain underdeveloped or undeveloped land adjacent to the Las Vegas strip\n.\n•\nVacant, Non-Operating Land. \nWe own certain vacant, non-operating land parcels located outside of Las Vegas. \n•\nEastside Property. \nIn 2017, we sold \n18.4\n acres of property located in Las Vegas, Nevada, east of Harrah’s Las Vegas, known as the Eastside Property, to Caesars for a sales price of $\n73.6\n million. It was determined that the transaction did not meet the requirements of a completed sale for accounting purposes due to a put-call option on the land parcels and the Caesars Forum Convention Center. On December 31, 2024, in connection with the expiration of the put option, we reassessed the accounting conclusion and determined that the transaction still does not meet the requirements for a completed sale. The amount of $\n73.6\n million is presented as land with a corresponding amount of $\n73.6\n million recorded in Other liabilities in our Balance Sheets.\nProperty and Equipment Used in Operations\nProperty and equipment used in operations is included within Other assets on our Balance Sheets and represents assets primarily related to VICI Golf, our golf operations. We assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy, which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset.\nAdditions to property used in operations are stated at cost. We capitalize the costs of improvements that extend the life of the asset and expense maintenance and repair costs as incurred. Gains or losses on the dispositions of property and equipment are recognized in the period of disposal.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease as follows:\nDepreciable land improvements\n2\n-\n50\n years\nBuilding and improvements\n5\n-\n25\n years\nFurniture and equipment\n2\n-\n10\n years\nImpairment\nWe assess our investments in land and property and equipment used in operations for impairment under ASC 360 “Property, Plant and Equipment” (“ASC 360”) on a quarterly basis or whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the carrying value of the asset. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in management’s intended holding period or potential sale to a third party, significant changes in real estate market conditions or tenant financial difficulties resulting in non-payment of the lease.  \nImpairments are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. With respect to estimated expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired, assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.\nIncome from Unconsolidated Affiliate\nIncome from unconsolidated affiliate represented our original \n50.1\n% ownership interest in the joint venture that holds the real estate assets of MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV, which was acquired as part of our acquisition of MGP on April 29, 2022. On January 9, 2023, we acquired the remaining \n49.9\n% interest from Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“BREIT”) for cash consideration of approximately $\n1.3\n billion and, accordingly, consolidated the operations of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV starting in the first quarter of 2023.\n Refer to \nNote 3 - Real Estate Transactions\n for further details.\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement\nOur investments in our Canadian gaming assets and certain of our loans are denominated in foreign currencies and, accordingly, we translate the financial statements of the subsidiaries that own such assets into U.S. Dollars (“USD” or “US$”) when we consolidate their financial results and position. Generally, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the date of the Balance Sheets and the resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income \nF - 22\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC. AND VICI PROPERTIES L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nin the Balance Sheets. Certain balance sheet items, primarily equity and capital-related accounts, are reflected at the historical exchange rate. Income Statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.\nWe and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany and third-party debt that is denominated in foreign currencies, which is neither our nor our consolidated subsidiaries’ functional currency of USD. When the debt and related operating receivables and/or payables are remeasured to the functional currency of the entity, a gain or loss can result. The resulting adjustment is reflected in Other (losses) gains, net in the Statement of Operations.\nOther Income and Other Expenses\nOther income primarily represents sub-lease income related to certain ground and use leases. Under our lease agreements, the tenants are required to pay all costs associated with such ground and use leases and provides for their direct payment to the landlord. This income and the related expenses are recorded on a gross basis in our Statement of Operations as required under GAAP as we are the primary obligor under the ground and use leases.\nFair Value Measurements \nWe measure the fair value of financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy, Level 1 assets/liabilities are valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets, Level 2 assets/liabilities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, on quoted prices in less active or inactive markets or on other “observable” market inputs, and Level 3 assets/liabilities are valued based significantly on “unobservable” market inputs.\nRefer to \nNote 9 - Fair Value\n for further information. \nDerivative Financial Instruments \nWe record our derivative financial instruments as either Other assets or Other liabilities on our Balance Sheets at fair value.\nThe accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges. We formally document our hedge relationships and designation at the contract’s inception. This documentation includes the identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, its risk management objectives, strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and our evaluation of the effectiveness of its hedged transaction.\nOn a quarterly basis, we also assess whether the derivative we designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be, and has been, highly effective in offsetting changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged transactions. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued and the changes in fair value of the instrument are included in Net income prospectively. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the value of the derivative previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions affect earnings. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments that qualify as hedges are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Balance Sheets with a corresponding change in Unrealized gain (loss) in cash flows hedges within Other comprehensive income on our Statement of Operations. \nWe use derivative instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate volatility, whether from variable rate debt or future forecasted transactions, which could unfavorably impact our future earnings and forecasted cash flows. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nGolf Revenues\nVICI Golf and Caesars are party to a golf course use agreement (the “Golf Course Use Agreement”), whereby certain subsidiaries of Caesars are granted certain priority rights and privileges with respect to access and use of certain golf course properties. For the year ended December 31, 2024, payments under the Golf Course Use Agreement were comprised of a $\n12.0\n million annual membership fee, $\n3.8\n million of use fees and approximately $\n1.5\n million of minimum rounds fees. The annual membership fee, use fees and minimum rounds fees are subject to an annual escalator beginning at the times provided under the \nF - 23\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC. AND VICI PROPERTIES L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nGolf Course Use Agreement. Revenue from the Golf Course Use Agreement is recognized in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers” and recognized ratably over the performance period.\nAdditional revenues from golf course operations, food and beverage and merchandise sales are recognized at the time of sale or when the service is provided and are reported net of sales tax. Golf memberships sold to individuals are not refundable and are deferred and recognized within golf revenue in the Statements of Operations over the expected life of an active membership, which is typically one year or less.\nIncome Taxes-REIT Qualification\nWe conduct our operations as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we pay as distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates (including any alternative minimum tax or excise tax applicable to non-REIT corporations), and distributions paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Additionally, any resulting corporate liability created if we fail to qualify as a REIT could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nThe operations of VICI Golf (represented by the \nfour\n golf course businesses), which are held in a TRS and certain of our other subsidiaries that operate in various states and municipalities within North America and the United Kingdom, are subject to various local, state and/or federal income taxes. Accordingly, we provide for a provision for income taxes in relation to these jurisdictions, which includes current and deferred portions. We use the asset and liability method to provide for income taxes, which requires that our income tax expense reflects the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for financial reporting versus income tax purposes.\nWe recognize any interest and penalties, as incurred, in general and administrative expenses in our Statement of Operations.\n \nRecent Tax Legislation \nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of reported profits (“Pillar Two”) that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries, many of which have begun incorporating Pillar Two model rules into their laws. The model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax and some countries have adopted Pillar Two effective January 1, 2024; however, countries must individually enact Pillar Two, which may result in variation in the application of the model rules and timelines. \nWe have evaluated Pillar Two and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our Financial Statements based upon our current structure and investments. However, there remains some uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two model rules. We will continue to monitor the United States and global legislative actions related to Pillar Two for potential impacts.\nDebt Issuance Costs \nDebt issuance costs are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of the underlying indebtedness. We present unamortized deferred financing costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability.\nTransaction and Acquisition Expenses\nTransaction and acquisition-related expenses that are not capitalizable under GAAP, including most leasing costs under ASC 842, are expensed in the period they occur. Transaction and acquisition expenses also include dead deal costs.\n \nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation under ASC 718, \nCompensation - Stock Compensation\n (“ASC 718”), which requires us to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. This expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant. For non-vested share awards that vest over a predetermined time period, we use the \n10\n-day volume weighted average price using the \n10\n \nF - 24\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC. AND VICI PROPERTIES L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ntrading days ending on the grant date. For non-vested share awards that vest based on market conditions, we use a Monte Carlo simulation (risk-neutral approach) to determine the value of each tranche. \nThe unrecognized compensation relating to awards under our stock incentive plan will be amortized to general and administrative expense over the awards’ remaining vesting periods. Vesting periods for awards of equity instruments range from \nzero\n to \nthree years\n.\nSee \nNote 13—Stock-Based Compensation\n for further information related to the stock-based compensation.\nEarnings Per Share and Earnings Per Unit\nEarnings per share (“EPS”) or Earnings per unit (“EPU”) is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share”.  Basic EPS or EPU is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stockholders or unit holders, as the case may be, by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock or units, as the case may be, outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS or EPU reflects the additional dilution for all potentially dilutive securities including those from our stock incentive plan.\n \nSee \nNote 12—Earnings Per Share and Earnings Per Unit\n for the detailed EPS and EPU calculations.\nUnderwriting Commissions and Offering Costs\nUnderwriting commissions and offering costs incurred in connection with common stock offerings are reflected as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Costs incurred that are not directly associated with the completion of a common stock offering are expensed when incurred.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk \nCaesars and MGM Resorts International (together with, as the context requires, its subsidiaries, “MGM”) are the guarantors of all the lease payment obligations of the tenants under the applicable leases of the properties that they each respectively lease from us. Revenue from our lease agreements with MGM represented \n38\n%, \n39\n% and \n34\n% of our lease revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Contractual rent from our lease agreements with MGM represented \n36\n%, \n37\n% and \n32\n% of our total contractual rent for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue from our lease agreements with Caesars represented \n36\n%, \n37\n%, and \n46\n% of our lease revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Contractual rent from our lease agreements with Caesars represented \n37\n%, \n39\n% and \n48\n% of our total contractual rent for years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAdditionally, our properties on the Las Vegas Strip generated approximately \n48\n%, \n49\n% and \n45\n% of our lease revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Except as described above, we do not believe there are any other significant concentrations of credit risk. \nCaesars and MGM are publicly traded companies that are subject to the informational filing requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are required to file periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC. Caesars’ and MGM’s SEC filings are available to the public from the SEC’s web site at \nwww.sec.gov\n. We make no representation as to the accuracy or completeness of the information regarding Caesars and MGM that is available through the SEC’s website or otherwise made available by Caesars, MGM or any third party, and none of such information is incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Account Pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nIn November 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which provides for additional disclosures as they relate to a company’s segments. Additional requirements per the update include disclosures for significant segment expenses, measures of profit or loss used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker and how these measures are used to allocate resources and assess segment performance. The amendments in this ASU also apply to entities with a single reportable segment and are effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted the guidance on December 31, 2024, and as a result of the adoption of ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting, we added disclosure in \nNote 15- Segment Information\n addressing and discussing the additional requirements above. \nF - 25\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC. AND VICI PROPERTIES L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires entities to disclose additional information with respect to the effective tax rate reconciliation and to disclose the disaggregation by jurisdiction of income tax expense and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on our Financial Statements.\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued its final climate disclosure rules, which require the disclosure of material climate-related information in annual reports and registration statements, including disclosure of effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions. In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the effectiveness of the new rules pending related litigation. If the stay is lifted and the effective times are unchanged, certain of the disclosure requirements will begin to apply to our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025. We are currently evaluating the impact of the final rules on our Financial Statements.\nNote 3 — \nReal Estate Transactions\n2024 Transactions\nOur significant activities in 2024, in reverse chronological order, are as follows:\nProperty Acquisitions and Investments\nVenetian Capital Investment\nOn May 1, 2024, we entered into agreements to fund up to $\n700.0\n million of capital investment into the Venetian Resort for extensive reinvestment projects through our Partner Property Growth Fund strategy (the “Venetian Capital Investment”). The Venetian Capital Investment will fund several projects, including hotel room product renovations, gaming floor optimization and entertainment and convention center enhancements, among others, seeking to improve the overall guest experience and enhance the value of the property. The invested capital will earn a return through the addition of incremental rent to the lease agreement for the Venetian Resort (as amended in connection with the Venetian Capital Investment, the “Venetian Lease”). \nThe up to $\n700.0\n million of funding through the Venetian Capital Investment is comprised of $\n400.0\n million that has already been funded and an incremental $\n300.0\n million that the Venetian Resort will have the option, but not the obligation, to draw in whole or in part until November 1, 2026. The initial $\n400.0\n million investment was funded based on a fixed schedule: $\n100.0\n million was funded in the second quarter of 2024, $\n150.0\n million was funded in the third quarter of 2024 and $\n150.0\n million was funded in the fourth quarter of 2024. The previous Property Growth Fund agreement entered into with the tenant in connection with the Venetian Resort acquisition in 2021 providing for up to $\n1.0\n billion of future development and construction project funding was terminated on May 1, 2024 concurrently with the entry into the agreement to fund the Venetian Capital Investment.\nIn connection with the Venetian Capital Investment, annual rent under the Venetian Lease increased commencing on the first day of the quarter immediately following each capital funding at a \n7.25\n% yield (the “Incremental Venetian Rent”). In addition to any increase pursuant to the Incremental Venetian Rent, annual rent under the Venetian Lease will begin escalating annually at \n2.0\n% on March 1, 2029 and, commencing on March 1, 2031, will begin escalating on the same terms as the rest of the rent payable under the Venetian Lease with annual escalation equal to the greater of \n2.0\n% or CPI, capped at \n3.0\n%. The aggregate annual rent under the Venetian Lease increased by $\n29.0\n million as a result of the $\n400.0\n million of funding in 2024 under the Venetian Capital Investment.\nWe determined that the amendment to the Venetian Lease in connection with the Venetian Capital Investment represented a lease modification under ASC 842 pursuant to which we were required to reassess the lease classification. Upon reassessment, we determined that the Venetian Lease continues to meet the definition of a sales-type lease. Accordingly, since the classification remains unchanged, we modified the future minimum lease cash flows to reflect the amendment and prospectively adjusted the discount rate used to recognize income, incorporating the impact of the additional funding and related incremental rent in connection with the Venetian Capital Investment.\nF - 26\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC. AND VICI PROPERTIES L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nLeasing Activity\nIndigenous Gaming Partners - PURE Lease Assignment\nOn December 10, 2024, we entered into an amendment and consented to the assignment of the master lease agreement for the PURE Canadian Portfolio (consisting of PURE Casino Calgary, PURE Casino Edmonton, PURE Casino Lethbridge and PURE Casino Yellowhead) (the “PURE Master Lease”) to an affiliate of Indigenous Gaming Partners Inc. (“IGP”), in connection with the acquisition of the operating assets of PURE Canadian Gaming Corp. by a subsidiary of IGP. The economic terms of the PURE Master Lease remain unchanged.\nIn connection with the assignment of the PURE Master Lease, we received a \n5\n-year ROFO on future sale-leaseback transactions with IGP. Any additional properties acquired pursuant to the ROFO will be added to the PURE Master Lease.\nReal Estate Debt Originations\nThe following table summarizes our 2024 real estate debt origination activity: \n(In thousands)\nInvestment Name\nMaximum Principal Amount\nInvestment Type\nCollateral\nGreat Wolf Mezzanine Loan \n(1)\n$\n250,000\n \nMezzanine\nPortfolio of \nnine\n Great Wolf Lodge resorts across the United States\nChelsea Piers One Madison Loan\n10,000\n \nSenior Secured Loan\nCertain equipment of the fitness club at the One Madison building in New York, NY\nHomefield Margaritaville Loan \n(2)\n105,000\n \nSenior Secured Loan\nMargaritaville Resort in Kansas City, Kansas, under development\nTotal\n$\n365,000\n \n____________________\n(1) In connection with the Great Wolf Mezzanine Loan, the $\n79.5\n million mezzanine loan for Great Wolf Lodge Maryland was repaid in full.\n(2) Simultaneous with entering into the loan agreement, we entered into a call right agreement that provides us with a call option on (i) the Margaritaville Resort, (ii) the new Homefield Kansas City youth sports training facility, (iii) the new Homefield baseball center, and (iv) the existing Homefield youth sports complex in Olathe, Kansas. We also received a right of first refusal to acquire the real estate of any future Homefield property, should Homefield elect to monetize such assets in a sale-leaseback transaction. If the call option is exercised, all of the properties, including the Margaritaville Resort, will be subject to a single long-term triple-net master lease with us.\nOne Beverly Hills Mezzanine Loan\nSubsequent to year end, on February 19, 2025, we purchased a $\n300.0\n million interest in an existing mezzanine loan related to the development of One Beverly Hills, a landmark \n17.5\n-acre luxury mixed-use development. One Beverly Hills is being developed by Cain International and will be anchored by Aman Beverly Hills and will also include a full-scale refurbishment of The Beverly Hilton, Aman-branded hospitality and residential offerings, and \n10\n acres of botanical gardens and open space.

We also assumed BREIT’s $\n1,497.0\n million pro rata share of an aggregate $\n3.0\n billion of property-level debt, which matures in 2032 and bears interest at a fixed rate of \n3.558\n% per annum through March 2030. The cash consideration was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the settlement of certain forward sale agreements. The lease agreement for MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (“MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease”) had an annual rent of $\n309.9\n million at the time of closing, all of which we are entitled to following the closing of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition. The MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease has a remaining initial lease term of approximately \n27\n years (expiring in 2050) at the time of closing, with \ntwo\n \nten-year\n tenant renewal options. Rent under the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease escalates annually at \n2.0\n% through 2035 (year 15 of the initial lease term) and thereafter at the greater of \n2.0\n% or the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) (subject to a \n3.0\n% ceiling). As of December 31, 2022, the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV was accounted for as an equity method investment under the voting interest model within Investment in unconsolidated affiliate on our Balance Sheets. \nSimultaneously with closing of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition, as a result of acquiring full ownership, we consolidated the joint venture and determined that the consolidation should be accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC 805-50. In application of the asset acquisition guidance, we retained the prior cost basis of our \n50.1\n% interest, which we previously acquired in connection with the MGP Transactions (as defined below), and combined such basis to the purchase price of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition. \nThe following is a summary of our net assets acquired upon consolidation of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV:\n(In thousands)\nAmount\nCarrying value of prior \n50.1\n% interest acquired in connection with the MGP Transactions\n$\n1,458,782\n \nConsideration paid for MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition\n1,261,882\n \nTransaction costs\n14,630\n \nTotal net assets acquired\n$\n2,735,294\n \nUnder ASC 805-50, we allocated the net assets acquired by major categories of assets acquired and liabilities assumed using relative fair value.

The fair value of the debt was estimated by modeling the contractual cash flows and discounting them back to the present value using an estimated market yield. Additionally, we considered current market rates and conditions by evaluating similar borrowing agreements with comparable loan-to-value ratios and credit profiles. The inputs used in determining the fair value measurement are considered Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nConcurrently with the closing of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV Interest Acquisition and consolidation of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease, we assessed the lease classification of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease and determined that it met the definition of a sales-type lease. Accordingly, the relative fair value of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay Lease of $\n5.5\n billion was recorded as an Investment in leases – sales-type on our Balance Sheets, net of an initial allowance for estimated credit losses in the amount of $\n210.0\n million.\nF - 29\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC.

Our lease agreements are generally long-term in nature with initial terms ranging from \n15\n to \n32\n years and are structured with several tenant renewal options extending the term of the lease for another \n5\n to \n30\n years. All of our lease agreements provide for annual base rent escalations, which may be fixed or variable over the life of the lease. The rent escalation provisions range from providing for a flat annual increase of \n1\n% to \n2\n% to an annual increase of \n1\n% in the earlier years and the greater of \n2\n% or CPI in the later years, which may be subject to a maximum CPI-based cap with respect to each annual rent increase.

The credit quality indicators are reviewed by us on a quarterly basis as of quarter-end. In instances where the guarantor of one of our lease agreements does not have senior secured debt with a credit rating, we use either a comparable proxy company or the overall corporate credit rating, as applicable.

Inc. (the “Exchange Notes”), (v) approximately $\n64.2\n million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, which were originally issued by MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP and a co-issuer (the “MGP OP Notes”) and remain outstanding following the issuance of the Exchange Notes pursuant to the exchange offer and consent solicitation for the then-outstanding MGP OP Notes, which settled in connection with the completion of our acquisition of MGP on April 29, 2022, (vi) $\n1.05\n billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes issued on March 18, 2024 (the “March 2024 Notes”) and (vii) $\n750.0\n million aggregate principal of Senior Notes issued on December 19, 2024, (the “December 2024 Notes”). The outstanding November 2019 Notes, February 2020 Notes, April 2022 Notes, Exchange Notes, MGP OP Notes, March 2024 Notes and December 2024 Notes are collectively referred to as the “Senior Unsecured Notes”. \nThe March 2024 Notes are comprised of (a) $\n550.0\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.750\n% Senior Notes due 2034, which mature on April 1, 2034, and (b) $\n500.0\n million aggregate principal amount of \n6.125\n% Senior Notes due 2054, which mature on April 1, 2054. We used the net proceeds of the March 2024 Notes to redeem our then-outstanding (i) $\n1,024.2\n million in aggregate principal amount of the \n5.625\n% Senior Notes due 2024, and (ii) $\n25.8\n million in aggregate principal amount of the \n5.625\n% MGP OP Notes due 2024. The December 2024 Notes are comprised of $\n750.0\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.125\n% Senior Notes due November 15, 2031. We used the net proceeds of the December 2024 Notes to redeem our then-outstanding $\n750.0\n million in aggregate principal amount of \n3.500\n% Senior Notes due 2025. \nSubject to the terms and conditions of the respective indentures, each series of Senior Unsecured Notes is redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at any time for a specified period prior to the maturity date of such series at the redemption prices set forth in the respective indenture governing such series. In addition, we may redeem some or all of such notes prior to such respective dates at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount thereof plus a “make-whole” premium.\nGuarantee and Financial Covenants\nNone of the Senior Unsecured Notes are guaranteed by any subsidiaries of VICI LP. The Exchange Notes, the MGP OP Notes, the April 2022 Notes, the March 2024 Notes and the December 2024 Notes benefit from a pledge of the limited partnership interests of VICI LP directly owned by VICI OP (the “Limited Equity Pledge”). The Limited Equity Pledge has also been granted in favor of (i) the administrative agent and the lenders under the Credit Agreement (as defined below), and (ii) the trustee under the indentures governing, and the holders of, the November 2019 Notes and the February 2020 Notes.\nPursuant to the terms of the respective indentures, in the event that the November 2019 Notes, February 2020 Notes and Exchange Notes (i) are rated investment grade by at least two of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and (ii) no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the respective indentures, VICI LP and its restricted subsidiaries will no longer be subject to certain of the restrictive covenants under such indentures. On April 18, 2022, the November 2019 Notes, February 2020 Notes and Exchange Notes were rated investment grade by each of S&P and Fitch and VICI LP notified the trustee of such Suspension Date (as defined in the indentures). Accordingly, VICI LP and its restricted subsidiaries are no longer subject to \nF - 39\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC. AND VICI PROPERTIES L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ncertain of the restrictive covenants under such indentures, but are subject to a maintenance covenant requiring VICI LP and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a certain total unencumbered assets to unsecured debt ratio. In the event that the November 2019 Notes, February 2020 Notes and Exchange Notes are no longer rated investment grade by at least two of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, then VICI LP and its restricted subsidiaries will again be subject to all of the covenants of the respective indentures, as applicable, but will no longer be subject to the maintenance covenant. \nThe indenture governing the April 2022 Notes, March 2024 Notes and December 2024 Notes contains certain covenants that limit the ability of VICI LP and its subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness and limit VICI LP’s ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. In addition, VICI LP is required to maintain total unencumbered assets of at least \n150\n% of total unsecured indebtedness. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.\nUnsecured Credit Facilities\nOn February 3, 2025, we entered into a credit agreement by and among VICI LP, the lenders party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, as amended from time to time (the “Credit Agreement”), providing for a revolving credit facility in the amount of $\n2.5\n billion scheduled to mature on February 3, 2029 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Concurrently with entry into the Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Facility, we terminated the  credit agreement dated February 8, 2022 by and among VICI LP, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, as amended from time to time (the “2022 Credit Agreement”) and the existing revolving credit facility in the amount of $\n2.5\n billion scheduled to mature on March 31, 2026 (the “2022 Revolving Credit Facility”). \nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes \ntwo\n \nsix-month\n maturity extension options \n(or \none\n \ntwelve-month\n extension option)\n, the exercise of which in each case is subject to customary conditions and the payment of an extension fee of (i) \n0.0625\n% on the extended commitments\n, in the case of each \nsix-month\n extension of the Revolving Credit Facility, and (ii) \n0.125\n% on the extended commitments, in the case of a \ntwelve-month\n extension of the Revolving Credit Facility\n. The Revolving Credit Facility includes the option to increase the revolving loan commitments by up to $\n1.0\n billion to the extent that any one or more lenders (from the syndicate or otherwise) agree to provide such additional credit extensions. \nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest, at VICI LP’s option, for U.S. Dollar borrowings at either (i) a rate based on SOFR plus a margin ranging from \n0.70\n% to \n1.40\n%, or (ii) a base rate plus a margin ranging from \n0.00\n% to \n0.40\n%, in each case, with the actual margin determined according to VICI LP’s debt ratings and total leverage ratio. The base rate is the highest of (i) the prime rate of interest last quoted by the Wall Street Journal in the U.S. then in effect, (ii) the NYFRB rate from time to time plus \n0.5\n% and (iii) the SOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus \n1.0\n%, subject to a floor of \n1.0\n%.\n \nIn addition to U.S. Dollar borrowings, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are also available in certain specific foreign currencies, bearing interest based on rates customary for such foreign currencies and subject to the same applicable margins for U.S. Dollar borrowings.\n \nIn addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires the payment of a facility fee ranging from \n0.10\n% to \n0.30\n% (depending on VICI LP’s debt ratings and total leverage ratio) of total commitments. The Revolving Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid in full or in part at any time, subject to customary breakage costs, if applicable. \nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants. \n \nSuch covenants include restrictions on mergers, affiliate transactions, and asset sales as well as certain financial maintenance covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable grace period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of VICI LP under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. \nThe Credit Agreement is consistent with certain tax-related requirements related to security for the Company’s debt. \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had C$\n188.0\n million and £\n14.5\n million outstanding on the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility in connection with our Canadian and United Kingdom foreign currency transactions, respectively. In connection with the termination of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, such outstanding balances were repaid and reborrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nMGM Grand/Mandalay Bay CMBS Debt\nOn January 9, 2023, as a result of our acquisition of the remaining \n49.9\n% interest in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV, we consolidated the assets and liabilities of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV, which includes the $\n3.0\n billion in principal amount of outstanding CMBS debt (the “MGM Grand/ Mandalay Bay CMBS Debt”). The MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay CMBS Debt was originally incurred on February 14, 2020 pursuant to a loan agreement (as amended from time to time, the “MGM Grand/\nF - 40\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC. AND VICI PROPERTIES L.P.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nMandalay Bay CMBS Loan Agreement”), and is secured primarily by mortgages on certain affiliates of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV’s fee interest in the real estate assets related to the MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. The MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay CMBS Debt matures in March 2032 and bears interest at \n3.558\n% per annum until March 2030 at which time the rate can change in accordance with the terms of the MGM Grand Mandalay Bay CMBS Loan Agreement until maturity. The MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay CMBS Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including, among other things, restrictions on the ability of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV and certain of its affiliates to incur additional debt and transfer, pledge or assign certain equity interests or its assets, and covenants requiring certain affiliates of the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV to exist as “special purpose entities,” maintain certain ongoing reserve funds and comply with other customary obligations for commercial mortgage-backed securities loan financings.\nBridge Facilities\nIn connection with our acquisitions, from time to time, we enter into agreements with certain lenders pursuant to which they provide financing commitments, typically consisting of a \n364-day\n first lien secured bridge facility, for the purpose of providing all or a portion of financing necessary in connection with the closing of such transactions. We used such bridge facility agreements in connection with our acquisition of MGM Growth Properties LLC and our acquisition of the Venetian Resort. In each case the commitments were subject to a tiered commitment fee based on the period the respective commitment was outstanding and a structuring fee. We recognized $\n16.3\n million in Interest expense in relation to such fees during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFinancial Covenants\nAs described above, our debt obligations are subject to certain customary financial and protective covenants that restrict VICI LP, VICI PropCo and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt, sell certain assets and restrict certain payments, among other things. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to make restricted payments to maintain our REIT status.

Diluted earnings per share reflect the additional dilution for all potentially dilutive securities such as stock options, unvested restricted shares, unvested performance-based restricted shares and the shares to be issued by us upon settlement of any outstanding forward sale agreements for the period such dilutive security is outstanding.

VICI LP’s interests are not expressed in units. However, given that VICI OP has a unit ownership structure and the financial information of VICI OP is substantially identical with that of VICI LP, we have elected to present the EPU of VICI OP. Basic EPU is computed by dividing net income attributable to partners’ capital by the weighted-average number of units outstanding during the period. In accordance with the VICI OP limited liability company agreement, for each share of common stock issued at VICI, a corresponding unit is issued by VICI OP. Accordingly, diluted EPU reflects the additional dilution for all potentially dilutive units resulting from potentially dilutive VICI stock issuances, such as options, unvested restricted stock awards, unvested performance-based restricted stock unit awards and the units to be issued by us upon settlement of any outstanding forward sale agreements of VICI for the period such dilutive security is outstanding. The units issuable upon settlement of any outstanding forward sale agreements of VICI are reflected in the diluted EPU calculations using the treasury stock method for the period outstanding prior to settlement. Under this method, the number of units used in calculating diluted EPU is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of units that would be issued upon full physical settlement of the units under any outstanding forward sale agreements for the period prior to settlement over the number of shares of VICI common stock that could be purchased by us in the market (based on the average market price during the period prior to settlement) using the proceeds receivable upon full physical settlement (based on the adjusted forward sales price immediately prior to settlement). Upon VICI’s physical settlement of the shares of VICI common stock under the outstanding forward sale agreement, the delivery of shares of VICI common stock resulted in an increase in the number of VICI OP units outstanding and resulting dilution to EPU. \nThe following tables reconcile the weighted-average units outstanding used in the calculation of basic EPU to the weighted-average units outstanding used in the calculation of diluted EPU:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDetermination of units:\n \nWeighted-average units outstanding\n1,058,971\n \n1,026,745\n \n885,786\n \nAssumed conversion of VICI restricted stock\n482\n \n784\n \n955\n \nAssumed settlement of VICI forward sale agreements\n453\n \n480\n \n1,213\n \nDiluted weighted-average units outstanding\n1,059,906\n \n1,028,008\n \n887,953\n \nF - 48\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC.

It is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Awards under the Plan may be granted with respect to an aggregate of \n12,750,000\n shares of common stock and may be issued in the form of (a) incentive stock options, (b) non-qualified stock options, (c) stock appreciation rights, (d) dividend equivalent rights, (e) restricted stock, (f) restricted stock units or (g) unrestricted stock. In addition, the Plan limits the total number of shares of common stock with respect to which awards may be granted to any employee or director during any one calendar year. At December 31, 2024, \n9,552,597\n shares of common stock remained available for issuance by us as equity awards under the Plan.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted approximately \n276,000\n, \n203,000\n, and \n384,000\n shares of restricted stock, respectively, under the Plan, respectively, subject to vesting restrictions based on service. Such restricted time-based stock awards vest ratably on an annual basis over a service period of \none\n to \nthree years\n. The number of shares granted was determined based on the \n10\n-day volume weighted average price using the \n10\n trading days immediately preceding the grant date. \nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the Company granted approximately \n348,000\n, \n235,000\n, and \n336,000\n performance-based restricted stock units, respectively, at target level of performance under the Plan, which are subject to vesting restrictions based on specified absolute and relative total stockholder return goals measured over a \nthree-year\n performance period. For purposes of determining the fair value for expense recognition, we used a Monte Carlo Simulation (risk-neutral approach) as these awards contain a market condition. The risk-free interest rate assumptions used in the Monte Carlo Simulation were determined based on the zero-coupon risk-free rate of \n1.7\n% - \n4.5\n% and an expected price volatility of \n20.0\n% - \n35.0\n%. The expected price volatility was calculated based on both historical and implied volatility. \nThe following table details the stock-based compensation expense recorded as General and administrative expense in the Statement of Operations:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStock-based compensation expense\n$\n17,511\n \n$\n15,536\n \n$\n12,986\n \nF - 49\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC.

U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pays taxes at regular corporate income tax rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its taxable income. We intend to meet those requirements and as a result, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax except for the TRS operations.  \nThe operations of VICI Golf (represented by the \nfour\n golf course businesses), which are held in a TRS and certain of our other subsidiaries that operate in various states and municipalities within North America and the United Kingdom, are subject to various local, state and/or federal income taxes. Accordingly, we provide for a provision for income taxes in relation to these jurisdictions, which includes current and deferred portions. We use the asset and liability method to provide for income taxes, which requires that our income tax expense reflects the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for financial reporting versus income tax purposes.\nThe composition of our income tax expense (benefit) was as follows: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In thousands)\nCurrent\nDeferred\nTotal\nCurrent\nDeferred\nTotal\nCurrent\nDeferred\nTotal\n     Federal\n$\n1,808\n \n$\n(\n702\n)\n$\n1,106\n \n$\n1,755\n \n$\n129\n \n$\n1,884\n \n$\n1,758\n \n$\n469\n \n$\n2,227\n \n     State\n1,816\n \n8\n \n1,824\n \n2,481\n \n13\n \n2,494\n \n658\n \n(\n9\n)\n649\n \nForeign\n641\n \n6,133\n \n6,774\n \n49\n \n(\n10,568\n)\n(\n10,519\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n4,265\n \n$\n5,439\n \n$\n9,704\n \n$\n4,285\n \n$\n(\n10,426\n)\n$\n(\n6,141\n)\n$\n2,416\n \n$\n460\n \n$\n2,876\n \nF - 50\nTable of Contents\nVICI PROPERTIES INC.

Accordingly, all of our operations have been considered to represent \none\n operating segment and \none\n reportable segment. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is Edward B. Pitoniak, our CEO, who assesses the performance of our Company using consolidated Net income. \nOn a monthly basis, the CODM reviews the consolidated income statement, including the primary drivers of changes against the prior period, which allows him to actively monitor and review our revenues and expenses. Given the relatively predictable nature of our cash flows due to the net lease structure of our real estate portfolio, the CODM’s primary focus when reviewing the consolidated income statement is monitoring changes in the line items in the Statement of Operations as compared to the prior period and to evaluate total general and administrative expenses against the Company’s approved budget. The CODM does not review assets at a different asset level or category than the amounts disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet.\nF - 52"
