The reports of the independent auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3 .\n APA Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria) APA is a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and is required to be independent with respect to the Company .\n Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reliability of financial reporting . It is designed to ensure the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles . It also must ensure that the records accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company’s assets .\n Ernst & Young LLP audited APA Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 .

We are not providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on accounts or disclosures to which they relate .\n At December 31, 2024, the asset retirement obligation (ARO) balance totaled $2,694 million . The balance reflects the estimated present value of the amount of the . assets associated with the . long-term . properties and other similar . properties associated with . the . North Sea segment . The cost of the North Sea project is estimated at $1.2 billion .\n The estimate was sensitive to retirement cost estimates, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions . At December 31, 2024, the decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of America properties (decommissioning contingency) balance totaled $1 billion . The estimation of the decommissions contingency requires significant judgment given the magnitude and higher estimation uncertainty .\n The estimate was sensitive to retirement cost estimates, which are subjective assumptions affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions . The Company applied a discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the proved oil and gas properties acquired . The transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values .\n The Company's fair value measurement of the proved oil and gas properties acquired is complex because of the use of the work of the Company’s internal reservoir engineers in estimating future production . The audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor judgement and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists . We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the . Company's internal controls to estimate the fair value of the acquired proved . oil and . gas properties .\n For the year ended December 31, the Company reported $9,737 billion in revenue .

Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet . The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets .\n The valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value include a market approach, an income approach, and a cost approach . A market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities . An income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount . The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset .\n APA completed its acquisition of Callon Petroleum Company (Callon) in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $4.5 billion . The fair value of proved oil and natural gas properties as of the acquisition date were estimated using the income approach . Fair value of unproved properties was estimated mainly using the market approach, based on acreage costs in areas where Callon acreage was acquired .\n In the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain non-core U.S. oil and gas producing properties in the Permian Basin . As a result of this agreement, a separate impairment analysis was performed for each of the assets within the disposal group . The historical carrying value of the net assets to be divested exceeded the fair value implied by the expected net proceeds .\n APA’s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production-sharing contracts (PSCs) Under these commodity sales contracts, the physical delivery of each unit of quantity represents a single, distinct performance obligation on behalf of the Company . Contract prices are determined based on market-indexed prices, adjusted for quality, transportation, and other market-reflective differentials .\n Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount . The quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices . Because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on the Company’s Egypt operations .\n Variable market prices for each short-term commodity sale are allocated entirely to each performance obligation as the terms of payment relate specifically to the Company’s efforts to satisfy its obligations . The Company monitors the credit quality of its counterparties through review of collections, credit ratings, and other analyses . Accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost net of an allowance for credit losses . As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $.625.2 million and $.87 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents .\n The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas property . Under this method, exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, are expensed as incurred . The carrying value of the Company’s property and equipment represents the cost incurred to acquire the property, including capitalized interest, net of any impairments .\n Costs of  the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling . This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of geological and engineering studies .\n The following table represents non-cash impairment charges of the carrying value of the Company’s proved and unproved properties . Depreciation of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production (UOP) method . The reserve base used to calculate depreciation for leasehold acquisition costs is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves only .\n When circumstances indicate that the carrying value of proved oil and gas properties may not be recoverable, the Company compares unamortized capitalized costs to the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows for the associated assets grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows of other assets . Future production volumes and estimated future commodity prices are the largest drivers in variability of future cash flow .\n In the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain non-core U.S. oil and gas producing properties in the Permian Basin . The historical carrying value of the net assets to be divested exceeded the fair value implied by the expected net proceeds . Gains and losses on divestitures are recognized in the statement of consolidated operations upon closing of the transaction .\n The estimation of useful life takes into consideration anticipated production lives from the fields serviced by the GPT assets, whether APA-operated or third party-operated, as well as potential development plans by the Company for undeveloped acreage within, or close to, those fields . An impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value . The Company recorded  no-no-receiving impairments of GPT facilities for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 .\n Significant oil and gas investments in unproved properties actively being explored, significant exploration and development projects that have not commenced production qualify for interest capitalization . Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service . Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Company’s weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred .\n The Company periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price, interest rate, and/or foreign exchange risk . All derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, are recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value . The Company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments .\n The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns .

The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard .\n The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting . APA repaid all of Callon’s debt, refinancing a portion by borrowing $1.5 billion under its unsecured committed term loan facility . The following unaudited pro forma combined results for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 reflect the consolidated results of operations of the Company as if the Callon acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2023 .\n The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been included for comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results that might have occurred had the transactions taken place on the dates indicated .

Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since completion of drilling were $.130 million at December 31, 2024 . The remaining projects pertain to onshore drilling activity in Egypt for which continued testing and evaluation is being performed .\n The Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production, as well as fluctuations in exchange rates in connection with transactions denominated in foreign currencies . The Company uses various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, and options, to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices .\n Derivative instruments are reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet . These fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions where counterparty master netting arrangements contain provisions for net settlement . The carrying value of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities and their locations on the consolidated balance sheet are as follows .\n Unrealized gains (losses) for derivative activity recorded in the statement of consolidated operations are reflected in “Unrealized derivative instrument (gains) losses, net” under “Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities” The Company held 13.1.1 million Kinetik Shares as of December 31, 2023 .\n The following table describes changes to the Company’s asset retirement obligation (ARO) liability for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023: The Company's other current liabilities: $1,678,678. r. 2024 and $2,438, respectively .
