    "item1": "Item 1. Business.”\nOverview of Fiscal Year 2025 \nDuring fiscal year 2025, we shipped 595 exabytes of HDD storage capacity. We generated revenue of approximately $9.1 billion with a gross margin of 35% and net income of $1.5 billion. Our operating cash flow was $1.1 billion\n and we paid \n$600 million \nin dividends. We issued \n$400 million\n principal amount of senior notes, repaid $479 million principal amount of the 2025 Notes and $505 million of the 2027 Notes, as well as repurchased $99 million principal amount of certain senior notes. Additionally, we acquired Intevac, Inc. (“Intevac”), a supplier of thin-film processing systems, for a net cash outlay of $47 million.\nRecent Developments, Economic Conditions and Challenges\nDuring fiscal year 2025, \nwe experienced a significant increase in demand for our high capacity nearline drives primarily from cloud customers. At the same time, we have continued to operate in a dynamic macroeconomic environment marked by rapid shifts in trade policies and increasing geopolitical tensions. These factors may impact our business and results of operations. We will continue to monitor the situation and assess plans to mitigate future risk to the business. Over the long-term we expect our hard drive storage business to benefit from future growth in data demand and data value, including from the adoption of Generative AI applications.\nFor a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks, see “Part I,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.\nCash Requirements and Commitments\nOur liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital, product development and capital expenditure needs, to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and to fund our quarterly dividend and any future strategic investments. \nPurchase obligations\n \nPurchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services, which are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specify all significant terms. From time to time, we enter into long-term, non-cancelable purchase commitments or make large up-front investments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components or technologies for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components. As of June 27, 2025, we had unconditional purchase obligations of app\nroximately $1.3 billion, primarily related to purchases of inventory components with our suppliers. We expect\n \n$1.2 billion\n \nof these co\nmmitments to be paid within one year. In addition, we also had certain long-term market share based non-cancellable inventory purchase commitments as of June 27, 2025. \nCapital expenditures\nWe incur material capital expenditures to design and manufacture our products that depend on advanced technologies and manufacturing techniques. As of June 27, 2025, we had unconditional commitments of \n$151 million\n primarily related to purchases of equipment, of which approximately \n$105 million\n is expected to be paid within one y\near. For fiscal year 2026, we expect capital expenditures to be higher than fiscal year 2025.\nOperating leases\nWe are a lessee in several operating leases related to real estate facilities for warehouse, office and lab space. As of June 27, 2025, the amount of future minimum rent expense for both occupied and vacated facilities under non-cancelable operating lease contracts was $516 million, of which $64 million is expected to be paid within one year. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 6. Leases\n” for details.\nLong-term debt and interest payments on debt\nAs of June 27, 2025, the future principal payment obligation on our long-term debt was $5.0 billion, which will mature in more than one year. As of June 27, 2025, future interest payments on this outstanding debt is estimated to be approximately $1.8 billion, of which $313 million is expected to be paid within one year. Subsequent to our Consolidated Balance Sheet date, on June 30, 2025, the conditional conversion feature of the 2028 Notes was triggered in accordance with the terms of the 2028 Notes indenture. Accordingly, the 2028 Notes are exchangeable through September 30, 2025. From time to time, we may repurchase, redeem or otherwise extinguish any of our outstanding senior notes in open market or privately negotiated purchases or o\ntherwise, or we may repurchase or redeem outstanding senior notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture.\n Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 4. Debt\n” for more details.\nBIS settlement penalty\nWe accrued a settlement penalty of $300 million for fiscal year 2023, related to BIS’ allegations of violations of the U.S. EAR, which were subsequently resolved by the Settlement Agreement in April 2023. As part of the Settlement Agreement with BIS, quarterly payments of $15 million are made over the course of five years beginning October 31, 2023, of which $60 million is expected to be paid within one year and $135 million thereafter. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 13. Legal, Environmental and Other Contingencies\n” for more details.\n46\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 27, 2025, we made cash payments of $14 million, primarily related to workforce reduction costs under our restructuring plans.\nAs of June 27, 2025, the future cash payments related to our remaining active restructuring plans were immaterial.\nIncome Tax\nAs of June 27, 2025, we had an immaterial liability for unrecognized tax benefits, none of which is expected to be settled within one year. Outside of one year, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.\n \nDividends\nOn July 29, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.72 per share, which will be payable on October 9, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2025. Our ability to pay dividends in the future will be subject to, among other things, general business conditions within the data storage industry, our financial results, the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our ordinary shareholders, including restrictions imposed by covenants on our debt instruments.\nShare repurchases\nFrom\n time to time, at our discretion, we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private, open market, or broker assisted purchases, tender offers, or other means, including through the use of derivative transactions. During fiscal year 2025, we repurchased approximately 1 million of our ordinary shares including shares withheld for statutory tax withholdings related to vesting of employee equity awards. See “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Repurchases of Our Equity Securities.” As of June 27, 2025, \n$5.0 billion\n remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit. We may limit or terminate the repurchase program at any time. All repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with our Constitution.\nWe require substantial amounts of cash to fund any increased working capital requirements, future capital expenditures, scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and payments of dividends. We will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations, including evaluating the issuance of new debt securities, exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions, open market purchases, tender offers or other means or otherwise. In addition, we may selectively pursue strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and investments, which may require additional capital.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n”. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include: Revenue - Sales Program Accruals and Income Taxes. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to warranty, valuation of inventories, assessing goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment, valuation of share-based payments and restructuring. We believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective, or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period. \nRevenue \n-\n Sales Program Accruals.\n We record estimated variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition as a reduction to revenue. Variable consideration generally consists of expected rebates to be provided in relation to sales incentive programs, such as price protection and volume incentives aimed at increasing customer demand. For OEM sales, rebates are typically established by estimating the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received based on an OEM customer's volume of purchases from us or other agreed upon rebate programs. For the distribution and retail channel, these sales incentive programs typically involve estimating the most likely amount of rebates based on historical price incentives, known future price trends, and channel inventory level. Total sales programs were 14% and 16% of gross revenue in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior periods were less than 1% of gross revenue in fiscal years 2025 and 2024. \nIncome Taxes.\n We mak\ne certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, recognition of income and deductions and \n47\nTable of Contents\ncalculation of specific tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for income tax and financial statement purposes, as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.\nThe deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. Each period, we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and, if necessary, adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments, and estimates. If our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly, our assessment of the need for, and the amount of, a valuation allowance may also change resulting in an additional tax provision or benefit.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”\n for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements.\nITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit rating changes and equity and bond markets. A portion of these risks may be hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nInterest Rate Risk.\n Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investment portfolio. As of June 27, 2025, we had immaterial available-for-sale investments, none of which had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months. \nWe have fixed rate debt obligations, which we enter into for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs. \nThe table below presents principal amounts and related fixed or weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of June 27, 2025. \n(Dollars in millions, except percentages)\nFiscal Years Ended\nFair Value at June 27, 2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\nThereafter\nTotal\nAssets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMoney market funds, time deposits and certificates of deposit\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFloating rate\n$\n254 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n254 \n$\n254 \nAverage interest rate\n4.22 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n4.22 \n%\nDebt\n \n \n \n \n \nFixed rate\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n1,500 \n$\n470 \n$\n638 \n$\n2,438 \n$\n5,046 \n$\n6,318 \nAverage interest rate\n— \n%\n— \n%\n3.50 \n%\n4.09 \n%\n7.14 \n%\n7.31 \n%\n5.86 \n%\n \nForeign Currency Exchange Risk. \nFrom time to time, we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures. Our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nWe hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The change in fair value of these contracts is recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities. All foreign currency forward exchange contracts mature within 12 months.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe table below provides information as of June 27, 2025 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The table is provided in dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts (at the contract exchange rates) and the weighted-average contractual foreign currency exchange rates.\n(Dollars in millions, except average contract rate)\nNotional\nAmount\nAverage\nContract Rate\nEstimated Fair Value\n(1)\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts:\n \n \n \nBritish Pound Sterling\n$\n19 \n$\n0.74 \n$\n— \nChinese Renminbi\n34 \n7.14 \n— \nSingapore Dollar\n127\n1.28\n— \nThai Baht\n100 \n32.49 \n— \nTotal\n$\n280 \n$\n— \n___________________________________________________________________________________\n(1) \nEquivalent to the unrealized net gain (loss) on existing contracts. \nOther Market Risks.\n We have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio. We monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations. We also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institution. Additionally, the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk. \nChanges in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our near-term financial results, but downgrades may negatively impact our future ability to raise capital, our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties, and may increase the cost of such capital.\nWe are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan—the SDCP. \nWe entered into a Total Return Swap (“TRS”) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities. We pay a floating rate, based on SOFR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS. The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liabilities due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees. \n     \n49\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nTable of Contents\nPage\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n51\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n52\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n53\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n54\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders’ \nDeficit\n55\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1.\n \nBasis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n56\nNote 2.\n \nBalance Sheet Information\n61\nNote 3.\n \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n63\nNote 4.

Accounting Policies\nOrganization\nSeagate Technology Holdings plc (“STX”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, unless the context otherwise indicates, the “Company”) is a leading provider of data storage technology and infrastructure solutions. Its principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, the Company produces a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (“SSDs”) and storage subsystems and offers storage solutions such as a scalable edge-to-cloud mass data platform that includes data transfer shuttles and a storage-as-a-service cloud.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.\n \nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with the United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The methods, estimates and judgments the Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFiscal Year\n \nThe Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30. Fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 are comprised of 52 weeks and ended on June 27, 2025, June 28, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. All references to years in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted. \nFiscal year 2026 will be comprised of 53 weeks and will end on July 3, 2026.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents. \nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company’s highly liquid investments are primarily comprised of money market funds, time deposits and certificates of deposits.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents. \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents represent cash and cash equivalents held as collateral at banks for various performance obligations.\nInventories.\n Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Net realizable value is based upon the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Adjustments to reduce cost of inventories to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess or obsolescence determined primarily by future demand forecasts.\nProperty, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements. \nProperty, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Equipment and buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease. The costs of additions and substantial improvements to property, equipment and leasehold improvements, which extend the economic life of the underlying assets, are capitalized. The cost of maintenance and repairs to property, equipment and leasehold improvements is expensed as incurred.\nIn accordance with its policy, the Company reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. Effective from the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company changed the useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment from a range of \nthree\n to \nseven years\n to a range of \nthree\n to \nten years\n based on a review of the technology product roadmap. The effect of this change in estimate increased the net income by $\n99\n million and increased the diluted earnings per share by $\n0.47\n for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2024.\n \n56\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill.\n The Company performs a qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. If it is determined in the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not below its carrying amount, including goodwill, then the Company will perform a quantitative impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Any excess in the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nLeases. \nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets are included in Other assets, net and lease liabilities are included in Accrued expenses and Other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company combines lease and non-lease components for facility leases and does not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments and ROU assets are based on the lease liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee’s initial direct costs. For the Company’s leases that do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future minimum lease payments is determined using the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. Additionally, the Company’s lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are reflected in the ROU asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees.\nThe Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or a rate primarily consist of common area maintenance charges, are expensed as incurred, and are not included in the ROU asset and lease liability calculation.\n \nOther Long-lived Assets.\n The Company tests other long-lived assets, including property, equipment and leasehold improvements, ROU assets and other intangible assets subject to amortization, for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are identified, the Company performs a recoverability test to assess the recoverability of an asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group and the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of assets in the asset group. \nWarranty. \nThe Company estimates probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized and records the estimated charge in Cost of revenue on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company generally provides warranty on its products for a period of \n1\n to \n5\n years. The Company's warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates, trends (including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods), and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues, if any. The Company also exercises judgment in estimating its ability to sell refurbished products. \nRevenue Recognition and Sales Incentive Programs. \nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nRevenue from sales of products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products, net of sales taxes. This typically occurs upon shipment from the Company. When applicable, the Company includes shipping charges billed to customers in Revenue and includes the related shipping costs in Cost of revenue on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company records estimated variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition as a reduction to revenue. Variable consideration generally consists of expected rebates to be provided for sales incentive programs, such as price protection and volume incentives aimed at increasing customer demand. For original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) sales, rebates are typically established by estimating the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received based on an OEM customer’s volume of purchases from the Company or other agreed upon rebate programs. For the distribution and retail channel, these programs typically involve estimating the most likely amount of rebates based on actual historical price incentives, known future price trends, and channel inventory level. Marketing development program costs are accrued and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the same time that the related revenue is recognized.\n57\nTable of Contents\nAt the end of the reporting period, the Company has unfulfilled product purchase orders which represent performance obligations not delivered, or partially undelivered under existing customer contracts. Some of these purchase orders are non-cancellable in nature. As of June 27, 2025, all non-cancellable purchase orders are less than one year in duration and are expected to be fulfilled in the next twelve months. The Company applied the optional exemption to not disclose the value of these remaining performance obligations as they are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.\nThe Company expenses sales commissions as incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded as Marketing and administrative in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \nRestructuring Costs. \nThe Company incurs restructuring costs in connection with workforce reductions, consolidation or closure of facilities and other exit costs. The Company records employee termination liabilities when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. Other costs associated with a restructuring plan or exit or disposal activities are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred or the asset is impaired.\n \nAdvertising Expense. \nThe cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were approximately \n$\n21\n million\n, $\n18\n million and $\n30\n million in fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nShare-Based Compensation.\n The Company accounts for share-based compensation at fair value, net of estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary termination behavior as well as the historical analysis of actual forfeited awards. The Company estimates the fair value of granted share options and restricted share units (“RSUs”) using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model and a single share award approach. The Company estimates the fair value of performance-based share units (“PSUs”) related to the Company’s return on invested capital and total shareholder return using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. Share-based compensation expense for share options and RSUs with only a service condition is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The expense for PSUs with both a service condition and a performance or market condition is recognized on a graded vesting basis.\n \nAccounting for Income Taxes\n. The Company records a provision or benefit for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, the Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company recognizes the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment. The Company periodically reassesses the need for valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets, considering both positive and negative evidence to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.\nEquity Investments. \nFrom time to time, the Company enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives, which are accounted for either under equity method or the measurement alternative. These investments are included in Other assets, net in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are subsequently adjusted through Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInvestments are accounted for under the equity method if the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling financial interest. These investments are measured at cost, less any impairment plus the Company's portion of investee’s income or loss. The Company uses the financial statements of investees to determine any adjustments, which are received on a one-quarter lag.\nFor equity investments where the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and there are no readily determinable fair values, the Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative, under which investments are measured at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for qualifying observable price changes on a prospective basis.\nThe Company’s strategic investments are periodically analyzed to determine whether or not there are indicators of impairment by assessing factors such as deterioration of earnings, adverse change in market/industry conditions, the ability to operate as a going concern, and other factors which indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n58\nTable of Contents\nForeign Currency Remeasurement and Translation. \nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of the Company's foreign operations. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured into the functional currency at the balance sheet date at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. The gains and losses from the remeasurement are included in Other, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nBusiness Combinations.\n The Company includes the results of operations of acquired businesses in the Company's consolidated results prospectively from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including existing technology, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests, if any, in the acquired entity based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired company and the Company and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related expenses, post-acquisition integration and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nGovernment Incentives. \nThe Company enters into government incentive arrangements with domestic and foreign, local, regional and national governments, which vary in size, duration and conditions. Government incentives, primarily cash grants, are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentives will be received and the Company will comply with the conditions specified in the agreement. Operating-related incentives are offset against the related expense in the period the expense is incurred. Capital-related incentives are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amounts of the related Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, net within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and result in a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful lives of the assets. Government incentives received prior to being earned are recognized in current or non-current deferred income within Accrued expenses and Non-current liabilities, whereas government incentives earned prior to being received are recognized in current or non-current receivables within Other current assets or Other asset, net, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash received from government incentives related to operating expenses is included as an operating activity in the Statements of Cash Flows, whereas cash received from incentives related to the acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, net is included as an investing activity. \nIncentives received from governments are subject to various confidentiality provisions. In general, they are related to manufacturing of HDDs, enhancing centers of excellence, product development and innovation capabilities. These incentives have initial terms ranging from 1 to 5 years. If conditions are not satisfied, the incentives are subject to reduction, recapture or termination.  \nIn fiscal year 2025, approximately $\n38\n million\n, \n$\n12\n million\n and \n$\n5\n million of operating grants were recognized as reductions to \nCost of revenue\n, \nProduct development\n and \nMarketing and administrative\n, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Capital-related incentives reduced gross \nproperty, plant and equipment\n by $\n45\n million as of June 27, 2025 and the reduction to depreciation expense was not material.\n \nAs of June 27, 2025, the grant receivables of $\n89\n million were reflected within \nOther current assets\n in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nIn fiscal year 2024, approximately $\n3\n million of operating grants were recognized as reductions to \nCost of revenue\n and Product development in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company also received advanced cash grants of $\n17\n million, which were reflected within Accrued expenses in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of \nJune 28, 2024\n. In fiscal year 2023, approximately $\n13\n million of operating grants were recognized as reductions to \nCost of revenue\n and Product development in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, including those related to revenue recognition, share-based compensation, restructuring accruals, provision for taxes, valuation allowance for deferred taxes, provision for expected credit losses, inventory reserves, warranty accruals, and impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The Company believes that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control. Should any of these estimates change, it could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n \n59\nTable of Contents\nConcentrations\n \nConcentration of Credit Risk. \nThe Company’s customer base is concentrated with a small number of customers. The Company does not generally require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. To reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations on its customers’ financial condition. The Company establishes allowances for expected credit losses based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, global macroeconomic conditions and an analysis of specific\n exposures. One customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable as of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024\n.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The Company maintains the cash and cash equivalents with four major financial institutions and a portion of such balances exceed or are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, insurance limits. The Company mitigates concentrations of credit risk in its financial instruments through diversification, by investing in highly-rated securities and/or major multinational companies. \nIn entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts, the Company assumes the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The counterparties to these contracts are major multinational commercial and investment banks, and the Company has not incurred and does not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.\nSupplier Concentration. \nCertain of the raw materials, components and equipment used by the Company in the manufacture of its products are available from single-sourced direct and indirect vendors. Shortages could occur in these essential materials and components due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. If the Company were unable to procure certain materials, components or equipment at all or acceptable prices, it would be required to reduce its manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2022-04 (ASC Subtopic 405-50), Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. This ASU requires disclosure of key terms of the outstanding supplier finance programs and a roll forward of the related obligations. The Company adopted the disclosure requirement during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Refer to \n“Note 2. Balance Sheet Information”\n for more details.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 (ASC Topic 280),\n Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n. This ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The Company adopted the disclosure requirement for its annual reporting in fiscal year 2025 and is required to adopt the guidance for interim period reporting beginning the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 on a retrospective basis. Refer to \n“Note 15. Business Segment and Geographic Information”.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 (ASC Topic 740), \nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\n. This ASU requires disaggregated income tax disclosures on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The Company is required to adopt this guidance for its annual reporting in fiscal year 2026 on a prospective basis but have the option to apply it retrospectively. This standard is expected to impact the Company’s disclosures and will not have impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 (ASC Subtopic 220-40), \nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. \nThe Company is required to disclose, in the notes to the financial statements, specified information about certain costs and expenses. The Company is required to adopt this guidance for its annual reporting in fiscal year 2028, and for interim period reporting beginning the first quarter of fiscal year 2029 on either a prospective or retrospective basis. This standard is expected to impact the Company’s disclosures and will not have an impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n60\nTable of Contents\n2.\nBalance Sheet Information\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash \nThe following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets that reconciles to the corresponding amount in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: \n(Dollars in millions)\nJune 27,\n2025\nJune 28,\n2024\nJune 30,\n2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n891\n \n$\n1,358\n \n$\n786\n \nRestricted cash included in Other current assets\n2\n \n2\n \n2\n \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the Statements of Cash Flows\n$\n893\n \n$\n1,360\n \n$\n788\n \nAccounts Receivable, net\nThe details of the accounts receivable, net were as follows:\n(Dollars in millions)\nJune 27,\n2025\nJune 28,\n2024\nAccounts receivable\n$\n963\n \n$\n433\n \nAllowances for expected credit losses\n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\nAccount receivable, net\n$\n959\n \n$\n429\n \nIn connection with the Company’s factoring agreements, from time to time the Company sells accounts receivables to third parties for cash proceeds less a discount.

The 2028 Notes will mature on June 1, 2028, with interest payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2024. \nFor the fiscal year ended June 27, 2025, the effective interest rate for the 2028 Notes was \n3.94\n%, with contractual interest expense of $\n52\n million and immaterial amortization of debt issuance costs. For the fiscal year ended June 28, 2024, the effective interest rate for the 2028 Notes was \n3.94\n%, with contractual interest expense of $\n42\n million and immaterial amortization of debt issuance costs.\nThe entire outstanding principal amount of certain term loans were repaid from the proceeds of the 2028 Notes issuance. The exchange was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and the Company recorded a net los\ns of $\n29\n million, \nwhich was included in the Net (loss) gain from debt transactions in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations in fiscal year 2024\n. In connection with the repayment of these loans, the Company terminated certain interest rate swap agreements on September 13, 2023 and received cash proceeds of \n$\n25\n million from the counterparty. The cash proceeds are reported within Net cash provided by operating activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows during the fiscal year ended 2024. The Company discontinued the related hedge accounting prospectively and realized a net gain of $\n104\n million in Net gain from termination of interest rate swap in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the fiscal year ended 2024. Additionally, $\n6\n million of the gains were amortized to Interest expense prior to the termination of interest rate swap in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations in fiscal year 2024. \nPrior to March 1, 2028, the 2028 Notes are exchangeable at the option of the holders only under the following circumstances:\n•\nduring any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2023 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the ordinary Shares for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the exchange price in effect on each applicable trading day; \n•\nduring the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2028 Notes for each trading day period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the ordinary shares and the applicable exchange rate on such trading day; or \n•\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events described in the indenture with respect to the 2028 Notes. \nOn or after March 1, 2028, the 2028 Notes are exchangeable at any time at the option of the holders until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, unless the 2028 Notes have been previously redeemed or repurchased by Seagate HDD. \nUpon exchange of the 2028 Notes, Seagate HDD will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes to be exchanged and will pay or cause to be delivered, as the case may be, cash, ordinary shares of the Company or a combination of cash and ordinary shares of the Company, at Seagate HDD’s election, in respect of any remainder of the exchange obligation in excess of such principal amount. The current exchange rate for the 2028 Notes is\n \n12.1324\n \nordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2028 Notes, which is equivalent to an exchange price of $\n82.42\n per share as of June 27, 2025. The exchange price is subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the indenture.\nSeagate HDD may redeem the 2028 Notes at its option, in whole but not in part, if Seagate HDD or the Guarantors have, or on the next interest payment date would, become obligated to pay to the holder of any Note additional amounts as a result of certain tax-related events at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, including additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (a “Tax Redemption”); provided that Seagate HDD may only redeem the 2028 Notes if: (x) Seagate HDD or the relevant Guarantor cannot avoid these obligations by taking commercially reasonable measures available to Seagate HDD or such Guarantor; and (y) Seagate HDD delivers to the Trustee an opinion of outside legal counsel of recognized standing in the relevant taxing jurisdiction attesting to such tax-related event and obligation to pay additional amounts.\n65\nTable of Contents\nSeagate HDD also may redeem the 2028 Notes at its option on or after September 8, 2026, in whole or in part, if the last reported sale price of ordinary shares of the Company has been at least \n130\n% of the exchange price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Seagate HDD provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Seagate HDD provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date (a “Provisional Redemption”). If Seagate HDD redeems less than all the outstanding 2028 Notes, at least $\n150\n million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the relevant notice of redemption date. \nIf Seagate HDD elects to redeem any of the 2028 Notes pursuant to a Tax Redemption or a Provisional Redemption, then a holder of any 2028 Notes called pursuant to a Tax Redemption or Provisional Redemption (the “Redemption Called Notes”) may exchange such Redemption Called Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day preceding the relevant redemption date, even if such Redemption Called Note is not otherwise exchangeable at that time. After this time, the right to exchange any Redemption Called Notes will expire unless Seagate HDD fails to pay the applicable redemption price, in which case a holder may exchange any Redemption Called Notes until the redemption price is paid.\nIf a holder elects to exchange any Redemption Called Notes, Seagate HDD shall, under certain circumstances, increase the exchange rate for such Redemption Called Notes as set out in the indenture.\nAs of the calendar quarter ended June 30, 2025 (subsequent to the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet date), the conditional conversion feature of the 2028 Notes was triggered, based on the price of the Company’s ordinary shares, as the last reported sale price of the Company’s ordinary shares was at least 130% of the then-applicable exchange price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days which ended on June 30, 2025, the last trading day of the applicable quarter. Accordingly, the 2028 Notes are exchangeable through September 30, 2025.\nIn connection with the 2028 Notes, the Company and Seagate HDD entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions. The current cap price of the capped call transactions is $\n107.785\n per share. The cost of the capped call transactions was $\n95\n million, which met certain accounting criteria to be accounted under Additional Paid-in Capital as part of the Shareholders’ Deficit and are not accounted as derivatives in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n2025 Notes\nOn January 2, 2025, the entire outstanding principal amount of $\n479\n million was repaid at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest. \n2030 Notes and 2027 Notes\n2030 Notes\n.

The Company incurred immaterial third party fees for the Exchange Offers as of fiscal year 2025.\nOther than the identity of SDST as the issuer and as an obligor, the terms of the New Notes are identical to the Old Notes with respect to their interest rate, interest payment dates, optional redemption prices and maturity. The New Notes were guaranteed by the same guarantors as the Old Notes, in addition to Seagate HDD (which is the issuer of the Old Notes). The New Notes have substantially the same covenants as the Old Notes and are subject to the same business and financial risks.\nCredit Agreement\nOn January 30, 2025, the Company and its subsidiary Seagate HDD Cayman (the “Borrower”), the Bank of Nova Scotia, as administrative agent, and the lenders thereto entered into a Credit Agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) and terminated their then-existing Credit Agreement, dated as of February 20, 2019 (the “Old Credit Agreement”).

The Borrower’s obligations under the New Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and certain material subsidiaries of the Company.\nThe New Credit Agreement also contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a total net leverage ratio of less than or equal to \n6.75\n to \n1.00\n, commencing with the fiscal quarter ended \nJune 27, 2025\n and declining over time so that the maximum permitted net leverage ratio for each fiscal quarter ending after \nJuly 2, 2027\n is \n4.25\n to \n1.00\n, \nin accordance with the terms of the New Credit Agreement.

Although realization is not assured, the Company’s management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when the Company re-evaluates the underlying basis for its estimates of future U.S. and certain non-U.S. taxable income.\nThe deferred tax asset valuation allowance decreased by $\n7\n million in fiscal year 2025, which primarily relates to releases in valuation allowance, partially offset with acquired deferred tax balances which are not likely to be realized. \nAt June 27, 2025, the Company had U.S. tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards of approximately $\n3.0\n billion and $\n726\n million, respectively, of which approximately $\n7\n million and $\n24\n million, respectively, are scheduled to expire at various dates in fiscal year 2026, if not utilized.

As of June 27, 2025, the Company had gross U.S. capital loss carryforwards of $\n288\n million, which if not utilized, will expire as of fiscal year 2029. As of June 27, 2025, the Company had gross non-U.S. capital loss carryforwards of $\n23\n million, which have an indefinite carryforward period.\nAs of June 27, 2025, approximately $\n102\n million and $\n41\n million of the Company’s total U.S. net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, respectively, are subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code.\n69\nTable of Contents\nThe Company established Singapore as its \nprincipal\n executive offices in fiscal year 2024.

Certain tax incentives may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net impact of these tax incentive programs was to increase the Company’s net income by approximately $\n285\n million in fiscal year 2025 ($\n1.32\n per share, diluted), to increase the Company's net income by approximately $\n40\n million in fiscal year 2024 ($\n0.19\n per share, diluted) and to decrease the Company’s net loss by approximately $\n14\n million in fiscal year 2023 ($\n0.07\n per share, basic).\nThe Company analyzes the potential needs for deferred tax liabilities with respect to the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries annually. The analysis focuses on the outside basis differences in the stock of the foreign subsidiaries as well as the withholding tax obligations those subsidiaries may have with respect to any distribution. The undistributed earnings for which taxes are not provided are permanently reinvested or can be repatriated without incremental tax liability. \nAs of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, the Company had approximately $\n107\n million and $\n112\n million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties.

When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nA fair value hierarchy is based on whether the market participant assumptions used in determining fair value are obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) or reflect the Company's own assumptions of market participant valuation (unobservable inputs). A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are inactive; quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; or\nLevel 3 - Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe Company considers an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis and views an inactive market as one in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers. Where appropriate, the Company’s or the counterparty’s non-performance risk is considered in determining the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.\n72\nTable of Contents\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following tables present the Company’s assets and liabilities, by financial instrument type and balance sheet line item that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, as of:\nJune 27, 2025\nJune 28, 2024\n \nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\n(Dollars in millions)\nBalance Sheet\nLocation\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Instruments\n(Level 1)\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\n(Level 3)\nTotal\nBalance\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Instruments\n(Level 1)\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\n(Level 3)\nTotal\nBalance\nAssets:\n \n \n \n \nMoney market funds\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n226\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n226\n \n$\n386\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n386\n \nTime deposits\nCash and cash equivalents\n—\n \n26\n \n—\n \n26\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal cash equivalents\n226\n \n26\n \n—\n \n252\n \n386\n \n—\n \n—\n \n386\n \nRestricted cash and investments:\n \n \n \nMoney market funds\nOther current assets\n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \nTime deposits and certificates of deposit\nOther current assets\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \nOther debt securities\nOther assets, net\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n15\n \n15\n \nDerivative assets\nOther current assets\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \nTotal assets\n$\n227\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n255\n \n$\n387\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n404\n \nLiabilities:\n \n \n \n \nDerivative liabilities\nAccrued expenses\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\nTotal liabilities\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\nAs of \nJune 27, 2025\n and June 28, 2024, the Company’s Other current assets included $\n2\n million\n \nin restricted cash equivalents held as collateral at banks for various performance obligations.\nAs of \nJune 27, 2025 and\n June 28, 2024, the Company had \nno\n material available-for-sale investments that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months.

Investments under the measurement alternative are recorded at cost, less impairment and adjusted for qualifying observable price changes on a prospective basis. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these investments would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. \nFor the investments that are accounted for under the equity method, the Company sold certain investments for $\n9\n million and recorded an immaterial gain for fiscal year 2025. The Company sold certain investments for $\n14\n million and recorded an immaterial gain for the fiscal year 2024.

For fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded an \nimmaterial\n net loss. As of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, the carrying value of the Company’s strategic investments under the measurement alternative was $\n26\n million and $\n65\n million, respectively.\nOther Fair Value Disclosures\nThe Company’s debt is carried at amortized cost. The estimated fair value of the Company’s debt is derived using the closing price of the same debt instruments as of the date of valuation, which takes into account the yield curve, interest rates and other observable inputs. Accordingly, these fair value measurements are categorized as Level 2.

As of June 27, 2025, \n$\n5.0\n billion\n remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit approved by the Board of Directors.\n The number of ordinary shares repurchased for tax withholding related to the vesting of equity awards was \n0.5\n million and the dollar value of shares repurchased was $\n54\n million for fiscal year 2025.\n10.\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-Based Compensation Plans \nSeagate Technology Holdings plc 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2022 EIP”)\n: On October 20, 2021, (the “Approval Date”), shareholders of the Company approved the 2022 EIP that replaced Seagate Technology Holdings plc 2012 Equity Inventive Plan (the “2012 EIP”). The 2022 EIP provides for the grant of various types of awards including RSUs, options, PSUs and share appreciation rights. The maximum number of shares that may be delivered to the participants under the 2022 EIP shall not exceed (i) \n14.1\n million\n \nordinary shares, plus (ii) any shares subject to any outstanding share awards granted under the 2012 EIP that, on or after the Approval Date expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, in whole or in part, without having been exercised or redeemed in full, or are settled in cash ((i) and (ii) together being the “Share Reserve”). The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to RSUs or PSUs (collectively, “Full-Value Share Awards”) shall not exceed \n12.3\n million ordinary shares. Any shares that are subject to the 2022 EIP will be counted against the Share Reserve as one share for every one share granted. As of June 27, 2025, there were \n9.5\n million\n ordinary shares available for issuance of Full-Value Share Awards under the 2022 EIP.\nSeagate Technology Holdings plc Executive Performance Bonus Plan (the “EPB”)\n. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, the Company implemented the EPB utilizing RSUs instead of cash payouts for senior executives. EPB RSUs are granted under the 2022 EIP, pursuant to the achievement of performance targets and individual goals under the EPB. No EPB awards were granted for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023. \nSeagate Technology Holdings plc Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”).\n There\n are \n60\n million ordinary shares authorized to be issued under the ESPP. The ESPP consists of a series of \nsix-month\n offering period with a maximum issuance of \n1.5\n million ordinary shares per offering period. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10% of their eligible compensation to purchase the Company’s common stock. The price of common stock purchased equals to \n85\n% of the lesser of the fair market value on the first day or the last day of each offering period. During fiscal years\n \n2025, 2024\n and 2023, employees purchased approximately \n1\n million shares each year under this plan at weighted average prices of\n \n$\n77.87\n, $\n54.71\n and $\n62.36\n per share,\n respectively.\n \nAs of June 27, 2025, approximately \n5.2\n million\n ordinary shares were available for future issuance.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense \nThe Company recorded \n$\n163\n million\n, $\n127\n million and $\n115\n million of share-based compensation with a resulting tax benefit o\nf $\n21\n million, $\n5\n million and $\n5\n million, respectiv\nely, during fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023. Management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and recognized compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest.\n75\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Units\nRSUs generally vest over a period of \nfour years\n, with \n25\n% vesting on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and the remaining \n75\n% vesting ratably each quarter over the next 36 months, subject to continuous employment with the Company through the vesting date. \nThe following is a summary of unvested restricted stock activities:\nUnvested Restricted Stocks\nNumber of Shares\n(In millions)\nWeighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value\nUnvested at June 28, 2024\n3.4\n \n$\n62.20\n \nGranted\n1.5\n \n$\n96.59\n \nForfeited\n(\n0.2\n)\n$\n72.50\n \nVested\n(\n1.8\n)\n$\n60.66\n \nUnvested at June 27, 2025\n2.9\n \n$\n79.96\n \nAt June 27, 2025, the total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to unvested restricted stocks was appr\noximately $\n171\n million\n. \nThis cost is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining term of \n2.2\n years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures.

The expected dividend yield is determined by dividing the expected per share dividend during the coming year by the grant date share price.\nEPB RSUs can be settled in cash, subject to certain employment conditions, and therefore classified as liability awards. The Company remeasures the fair value of these liability awards at each fiscal quarter end. Generally, EPB RSUs vest in full on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date.\nDuring fiscal year 2025, the Company recognized approximately $\n37\n million of share-based compensation expense related to EPB RSUs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, with the corresponding liability recorded within Accrued employee compensation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the Company did not recognize any share compensation expense related to liability awards. \nPerformance-based Share Units\nThe Company granted PSUs that vest on the satisfaction of continuous employment and achievement of certain financial and operational performance goals established by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee\n”). These awards vest after the end of the performance period of \nthree year\ns\n from the grant date. During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the PSUs granted and outstanding were not material. Compensation expense related to these units is only recorded in a period if it is probable that the performance goals will be met, and it is to be recorded at the expected level of achievement. The expenses associated with these PSUs were not material for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nPerformance-based Share Units\nNumber of Shares\n(In millions)\nWeighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value\nUnvested at June 28, 2024\n0.9\n \n$\n70.97\n \nGranted\n0.2\n \n$\n103.53\n \nForfeited\n(\n0.1\n)\n$\n92.17\n \nVested\n(\n0.2\n)\n$\n73.64\n \nUnvested at June 27, 2025\n0.8\n \n$\n75.55\n \n76\nTable of Contents\nAt June 27, 2025, the total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to unvested performance-based share units was appr\noximately \n$\n38\n million\n. \nThis cost is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining term of \n1.2\n years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures.\n \nThe aggregate fair value of \nperformance-based share units \nvested during fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 were approximately\n \n$\n17\n million\n, \n$\n6\n million\n a\nnd $\n16\n million, respectively.\nThe fair value related to PSUs for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 were estimated using the following assumptions:\n \nFiscal Years\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nPSUs subject to TSR/ROIC conditions\nExpected term (in years)\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\nVolatility\n37\n \n%\n39\n \n%\n40\n \n%\nWeighted-average volatility\n37\n \n%\n39\n \n%\n40\n \n%\nExpected dividend rate\n2.8\n \n%\n4.4\n \n%\n4.1\n \n%\nWeighted-average expected dividend rate\n2.8\n \n%\n4.4\n \n%\n4.1\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n3.5\n \n%\n4.6\n \n%\n3.6\n \n%\nWeighted-average fair value\n$\n75.55\n$\n70.97\n$\n64.38\nShare Options\nOptions generally vest over a period of \nfour years\n, with \n25\n% vesting on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and the remaining \n75\n% vesting ratably each quarter over the next \n36\n months, subject to continuous employment with the Company through the vesting date. The exercise price of a share option is equal to the closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares on NASDAQ on the grant date. The expenses associated with share options were not material for any of the periods presented.\nEmployee Savings Plan\nThe Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. In the U.S., qualified employees under the Seagate 401(k) Plan (the \"401(k) plan\") may elect to make contributions up to \n50\n% of their eligible earned compensation, but not more than statutory limits. Pursuant to the 401(k) plan, the Company matches \n50\n% of employee contributions, up to \n6\n% of compensation, subject to a maximum annual employer contribution of \n$\n6,000\n per participating employee. During fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company made matching contributions \nof $\n67\n million, $\n65\n million and $\n79\n million, res\npectively, under defined contribution plans for employees\n.\n11.\nGuarantees\nIndemnifications of Officers and Directors\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements \nwith its directors and certain of its officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The Company maintains director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from its obligation to indemnify its directors and officers in certain circumstances. \nThe nature of these indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay on behalf of its officers and directors. Historically, the Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such indemnification agreements \nand \nno\n amount has\n been accrued in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.\nIndemnification Obligations\nThe Company from time to time enters into agreements with customers, suppliers, partners and others in the ordinary course of business that provide indemnification for certain matters including, but not limited to, intellectual property infringement claims, environmental claims and breach of agreement claims. The nature of the Company’s indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay. Historically, the Compan\ny has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and \nno\n amount \nhas been accrued in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.\n77\nTable of Contents\nProduct Warranty\nChanges in the Company’s product warranty liability during the fiscal years ended June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024 were as follows: \n \nFiscal Years Ended\n(Dollars in millions)\nJune 27,\n2025\nJune 28,\n2024\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n149\n \n$\n168\n \nWarranties issued\n68\n \n53\n \nRepairs and replacements\n(\n88\n)\n(\n81\n)\nChanges in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations\n8\n \n9\n \nBalance, end of period\n$\n137\n \n$\n149\n \n12.\nEarnings \n(Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period and the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding options, unvested restricted share units and performance-based share units and shares to be purchased under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the treasury stock method, as well as shares issuable in connection with the Company’s exchangeable senior notes using the “if-converted” method.\nUnder the treasury stock method, the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted net earnings per share and an increase in fair market value of the Company’s share price can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. Under the “if-converted” method, diluted earnings per share is calculated assuming that the excess value above the principal of the exchangeable notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive, which could adversely affect our diluted earnings per share. \nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to the shareholders of the Company:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n(In millions, except per share data)\nJune 27,\n2025\nJune 28,\n2024\nJune 30,\n2023\nNumerator:\n \n \n \nNet income (loss)\n$\n1,469\n \n$\n335\n \n$\n(\n529\n)\nNumber of shares used in per share calculations:\n \n \n \nTotal shares for purposes of calculating basic net income (loss) per share \n212\n \n209\n \n207\n \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities:\n \n \n \nEmployee equity award plans\n2\n \n2\n \n—\n \n2028 Notes if-converted shares\n3\n \n1\n \n—\n \nTotal shares for purposes of calculating diluted net income (loss) per share \n217\n \n212\n \n207\n \nNet income (loss) per share \n \n \n \nBasic\n$\n6.93\n \n$\n1.60\n \n$\n(\n2.56\n)\nDiluted\n6.77\n \n1.58\n \n(\n2.56\n)\nAll potentially dilutive securities that could have an anti-dilutive effect on the calculation of the earnings per share have been excluded for the periods presented. The weighted average anti-dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share were \nnot\n material for the fiscal years ended \nJune 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024. The weighted average anti-dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share were \n7\n million\n for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023\n.\n78\nTable of Contents\n13.\nLegal, Environmental and Other Contingencies\nThe Company assesses the probability of an unfavorable outcome of all its material litigation, claims or assessments to determine whether a liability had been incurred and whether it is probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss. In the event that an unfavorable outcome is determined to be probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company establishes an accrual for the litigation, claim or assessment. In addition, in the event an unfavorable outcome is determined to be less than probable, but reasonably possible, the Company will disclose an estimate of the possible loss or range of such loss; however, when a reasonable estimate cannot be made, the Company will provide disclosure to that effect. Litigation is inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions. Additionally, the Company may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially.\nLitigation\nLambeth Magnetic Structures LLC v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc., et al. \nOn April 29, 2016, Lambeth Magnetic Structures LLC filed a complaint against Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. and Seagate Technology LLC in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,128,988, seeking damages as well as additional relief. The district court entered judgment in favor of Seagate on April 19, 2022. An appeal to the Federal Circuit is pending. The Company believes the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this case.\nSeagate Technology LLC, et al. v. Headway Technologies, Inc., et al.\n On February 18, 2020, Seagate Technology LLC and certain of its affiliates, (collectively, the “Seagate Entities”) filed a complaint alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws as well as breach of contract in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against suppliers of HDD suspension assemblies, including NHK Spring Co. Ltd., TDK Corporation (“TDK”), Hutchinson Technology Inc (“HTI”). The Seagate Entities seek to recover damages suffered as a result of the suspension assembly suppliers’ conduct, and additional relief permitted by law. On April 8, 2022, the court dismissed with prejudice all claims against TDK and HTI after the Seagate Entities settled with those defendants. On August 2, 2022, NHK Spring Co. Ltd. filed a motion for Partial Summary Judgment under the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvement Act (“FTAIA Motion”). On November 17, 2023, the Court granted NHK’s FTAIA Motion on reconsideration, denying the majority of Seagate’s antitrust claims. The Court’s FTAIA decision is now on appeal with the Ninth Circuit. \nIn re Seagate Technology Holdings plc Securities Litigation.\n On July 10, 2023 and July 26, 2023, two securities class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Seagate Technology Holdings plc, Dr. William D. Mosley, and Gianluca Romano. The cases were consolidated on September 25, 2023. On September 12, 2024, the plaintiffs filed the currently operative complaint, asserting claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5, and a class period between September 14, 2020 and April 19, 2023, inclusive. The operative complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief. On May 12, 2025, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the operative complaint. On June 9, 2025, the defendants moved to certify the May 12, 2025 order for interlocutory appeal. The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the case.\nGodo Kaisha IP Bridge 1 v. Seagate Technology LLC, Seagate Technology (US) Holding, Inc., Seagate Technology (Thailand) Limited, Seagate Singapore International Headquarters Ltd., Seagate Technology (Netherlands) B.V. \nOn March 15, 2024, a patent infringement action was filed by Godo Kaisha IP Bridge 1 (“IP Bridge”) against Seagate in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The case was subsequently transferred to the District Court of Minnesota on September 4, 2024. The complaint alleges patent infringement by Seagate of nine U.S. patents. The Company believes the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this case.\nBIS Settlement\nOn April 18, 2023, the Company’s subsidiaries Seagate Technology LLC and Seagate Singapore International Headquarters Pte. Ltd (collectively, “Seagate”), entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) that resolves BIS’ allegations regarding Seagate’s sales of hard disk drives to Huawei between August 17, 2020 and September 29, 2021. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Seagate has agreed to pay $\n300\n million to BIS in quarterly installments of $\n15\n million over the course of \nfive years\n beginning October 31, 2023. Seagate has also agreed to complete \nthree\n audits of its compliance with the license requirements of Section 734.9 of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), including \none\n audit by an unaffiliated third-party consultant chosen by Seagate with expertise in U.S. export control laws and \ntwo\n internal audits. \nThe Company accrued a charge of $\n300\n million during fiscal year 2023, of which \n$\n60\n million\n \nand \n$\n135\n million\n were included in Accrued expense and Other non-current liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 27, 2025. For the fiscal year ended 2025, $\n60\n million was paid and reported as an outflow from operating activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n79\nTable of Contents\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company’s operations are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of the Company’s operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities.\nSome environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the “Superfund” law) and its state equivalents, can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites, regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. The Company has been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites. At each of these sites, the Company has an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties. The Company has fulfilled its responsibilities at some of these sites and remains involved in only a few at this time.\nWhile the Company’s ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy, based on its current estimates of cleanup costs and its expected allocation of these costs, the Company does not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material.\nThe Company may be subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products. For example, the European Union (“EU”) enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (2011/65/EU), which prohibits the use of certain substances, including lead, in certain products, including disk drives and server storage products, put on the market after July 1, 2006. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, China, Japan and others. The EU REACH Directive (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals, EC 1907/2006) also restricts substances of very high concern in products. If the Company or its suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions, recycle content requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide, it could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nOther Matters \nFrom time to time, arising in the normal course of business, the Company is involved in a number of other judicial, regulatory or administrative proceedings and investigations incidental to its business, and the Company expects to be involved in such proceedings and investigations arising in the normal course of its business in the future. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.\n \n14.\nCommitments\nUnconditional Long-Term Purchase Obligations. \nAs of June 27, 2025, the Company had unconditional long-term purchase obligations of approx\nimately $\n77\n million, primarily related to purchases of inventory components. The Company expects the commitment to total $\n38\n million, $\n18\n million, $\n12\n million and $\n9\n million \nfor fiscal years 2027, 2028, 2029 and 2030 \nrespectively\n. In addition, the Company also had certain long-term market share based inventory purchase commitments as of \nJune 27, 2025.\nUnconditional Long-Term Capital Expenditures\n. As of \nJune 27, 2025, the Company had unconditional long-term commitments of approximately $\n46\n million, primarily related to purchases of equipment. The Company expects capital expenditures of $\n11\n million in fiscal year 2027 and $\n35\n million for fiscal years 2028 and thereafter.\n15.\nBusiness Segment and Geographic Information\n The Company’s manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various data storage and systems solutions that serve multiple applications and markets. The Company has determined that its Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance of the Company and makes decisions regarding investments in the Company’s technology platforms and manufacturing infrastructure based on the Company’s consolidated results, including net income reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result, the Company has concluded that its manufacture and distribution of storage solutions constitutes \none\n operating segment.\nSignificant expense categories regularly provided to and reviewed by the CODM are those presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n80\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s long-lived assets by country:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n(Dollars in millions)\nJune 27,\n2025\nJune 28,\n2024\nJune 30,\n2023\nLong-lived assets:\n \n \n \nUnited States\n$\n672\n \n$\n658\n \n$\n667\n \nThailand\n546\n \n574\n \n606\n \nSingapore\n411\n \n447\n \n460\n \nOther\n381\n \n338\n \n369\n \nConsolidated\n$\n2,010\n \n$\n2,017\n \n$\n2,102\n \n16.\nRevenue\nThe following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by sales channel and country for the Company’s single reportable segment:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n(Dollars in millions)\nJune 27,\n2025\nJune 28,\n2024\nJune 30,\n2023\nRevenues by Channel\n \nOEMs\n$\n7,282\n \n$\n4,896\n \n$\n5,448\n \nDistributors\n1,060\n \n972\n \n1,119\n \nRetailers\n755\n \n683\n \n817\n \nTotal\n$\n9,097\n \n$\n6,551\n \n$\n7,384\n \nRevenue from external customers \n(1)\n:\n \n \n \nSingapore\n$\n3,759\n \n$\n3,429\n \n$\n3,271\n \nUnited States\n4,410\n \n2,308\n \n3,053\n \nThe Netherlands\n924\n \n802\n \n1,046\n \nOther\n4\n \n12\n \n14\n \nTotal\n$\n9,097\n \n$\n6,551\n \n$\n7,384\n \n____________________________________________________ \n(1) \nRevenue is attributed to countries based on bill from locations.\n \nIn fiscal year 2025, one customer accounted for approximately \n10\n% of consolidated revenue.

The acquisition aligns with the Company's strategy to integrate important components and manufacturing processes. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented because they are not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations.\nIn connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately \n$\n97\n million\n of net tangible assets, primarily consisted of cash and investments, \n$\n19\n million\n of intangible assets and \n$\n2\n million\n of goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The Company is amortizing the intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of \nthree years\n.\nDivestiture\nSale of SoC Operations\nOn April 23, 2024, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Avago Technologies International Sales Pte. Limited (“Purchaser”), a subsidiary of Broadcom Inc., and sold certain intellectual property, equipment and other assets related to the design, development and manufacture of its SoC products to Purchaser. Purchaser and its affiliates also offered employment to certain of the Company’s employees engaged in the SoC operations. In connection with this transaction, t\nhe Company and Purchaser have also restructured certain pre-existing purchasing agreements (collectively, the “Transaction”). Total consideration for this Transaction was $\n600\n million, including cash proceeds of $\n560\n million at close. The remaining $\n40\n million relates to standard indemnification clauses, of which \n$\n25\n million\n was received during fiscal year 2025 and \n$\n15\n million\n is recorded in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 27, 2025. The agreement also contains regulatory review indemnification clauses agreed to by both parties in conjunction with the transaction closing. \nBased on the valuation performed by the Company, \n$\n234\n million\n of the consideration was attributable to the restructuring of pre-existing purchase agreements and recorded as a deferred liability within Other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 28, 2024. The deferred liability is expected to be recognized ratably over the terms of the restructured purchase agreements. Estimating the fair value of the restructuring of pre-existing purchase agreements is judgmental in nature and involves the use of estimates and assumptions. The Company estimated the fair value of its restructuring of pre-existing purchase agreements using the market approach based on discounted cash flow analysis of management’s short-term and long-term forecast of purchase volume and average market price. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics. This deferred liability is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. \nAs a result of the Transaction, the Company recorded a pre-tax net gain of $\n313\n million from the sale of assets and transfer of liabilities, which included \n$\n18\n million\n of goodwill allocated to SoC operations based on its relative fair value of the Company because the disposal group constituted a business for accounting purposes. This was recorded in the Net gain \nfrom business divestiture in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal year 2024. For the fiscal year 2024, the net proceeds of $\n226\n million, net of transaction costs paid, from this Transaction was recorded as an operating inflow and $\n326\n million was recorded as an investing inflow on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Transaction did not meet the criteria of discontinued operation because the disposal did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results.\n18.\nSubsequent Event\nDividend Declared\nOn July 29, 2025, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.72\n per share, which will be payable on October 9, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2025\n.\n82\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Seagate Technology Holdings public limited company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Seagate Technology Holdings public limited company (the Company) as of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 27, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 27, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated August 1, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue recognition—Sales incentive program rebates and discounts\nDescription of the Matter\nAs disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adjusts revenue to account for variable consideration related sales incentive programs such as price protection and volume incentives to estimate the final selling prices of products sold to Original Equipment Manufacturers (”OEMs”) and through distributor and retail channels.\nIdentifying the complete population of sales incentive programs and auditing management’s corresponding estimates involved in determining the final selling prices for expected future reductions was complex, as it required testing subjective assumptions about the extent of price adjustments on products and the timing of sales to end customers by the Company’s distributor partners.\n83\nTable of Contents\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the completeness of sales incentive programs, including the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in the calculations, level of channel inventory, and management’s assumptions.\nTo test the sales incentive programs, we inspected significant sales arrangements that included contractual rights to discounts and rebates and evaluated management’s estimates of variable consideration applied to reflect expected final selling prices based on such contractual terms. We examined credit memos issued during the year and after year-end to determine the completeness of the identified sales incentives population. We directly confirmed the terms and conditions of significant agreements with a sample of the Company’s customers. Additionally, we performed a retrospective review comparing prior period assumptions to actual results in subsequent periods and conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate the significance of potential effects on revenue recognition due to changes in the Company's significant assumptions.\nRealizability of deferred income taxes\nDescription of the Matter\nAt June 27, 2025, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $1,540 million, partially offset by a valuation allowance of $423 million. As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recognizes a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax assets to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. \nAuditing the realizability of the deferred tax assets was complex as the assessment process includes forecasting future sources of taxable income which includes subjective management assumptions, and the amounts involved are material to the financial statements as a whole.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets. This included controls over management’s determination of sources and amount of future taxable income including income from operations.\nAmong other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the assumptions used by the Company to develop projections of future taxable income by jurisdiction and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in its projections. For example, we compared the projections of future taxable income with the actual results of prior periods, as well as management’s consideration of current industry and economic trends. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s projections and compared the projections of future taxable income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the Company. \n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1980.\nSan Jose, California\nAugust 1, 2025\n84\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Seagate Technology Holdings public limited company\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Seagate Technology Holdings public limited company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Seagate Technology Holdings public limited company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 27, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated August 1, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nAugust 1, 2025\n85\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.\nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNot applicable.\nITEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nConclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded, based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) by our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 27, 2025.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO.  \nBased on our evaluation under the 2013 framework in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 27, 2025. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 27, 2025 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as stated in their report that is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Seagate have been detected. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 27, 2025. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\n86\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nTrading Plans\n or Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nThe table below summarizes the material terms of trading arrangements \nadopted\n by any of our executive officers or directors during the fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2025.
