  "item1_summary": " Approximately half our total revenue is generated through the on-site supply mode, which is governed by contracts that allow us to pass through changes in energy costs to our customers . Our industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Middle East and India segments . In fiscal year 2024, this segment also included the results of our former liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment business, which we sold to Honeywell International Inc. on 30 September 2024 .\n Sales of $12.0 billion decreased 1%, or $63.3, as 4% lower volumes were partially offset by 2% higher energy cost pass-through to customers and 1% higher pricing driven by non-helium merchant products across all regions . Lower volumes primarily reflect the September 2024 LNG sale, lower global helium demand, and previously announced project exits . Operating loss was $877.0 compared to operating income of $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2024 .\n Air Products' adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\") was $12.03 on a non-GAAP basis . In the prior year, EPS was $17.24 and adjusted EPS was  $12.43 . Adjusted EBITDA of $5.1 billion increased 1%, or $30.1% . Loss per share of $1.74 was driven by an after-tax charge of $3.0 billion for business and asset actions recorded during fiscal year 2025 .\n Per share impacts associated with charges for business and asset actions were calculated based on a total after-tax charge attributable to Air Products of approximately $3.0 billion ($13.68 per share) The amount of the charges attributable to our noncontrolling partners was $10.7.7 per share . These impacts were calculated independently and may not sum to totals due to rounding .\n Air Products is well-positioned to deliver sustainable growth through a renewed focus on our core industrial gas business . Decisive actions taken in fiscal year 2025, including the cancellation and descoping of several large energy transition projects and other targeted productivity initiatives, reflect our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence . We remain confident in the long-term demand fundamentals for industrial gases and clean energy solutions .\n In fiscal year 2026, we expect to achieve earnings growth from new plant onstreams, continued pricing discipline, and productivity improvements . We remain committed to cost control, a reduction in capital expenditures, and other measures aimed at unlocking value and generating cash . Lower volumes of 4% were partially offset by higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 2% and favorable pricing of 1% .\n The overall pricing improvement reflects a 2% increase in our merchant business, which was driven by non-helium product lines in our Europe and Americas segments . Currency was flat versus the prior year . Gross margin of 31.4% decreased 110 bp from 32.5% in the previous year . Research and development expense as a percentage of sales of 0.8% was flat .\n $3.0 billion attributable to Air Products after tax, or $13.68 per share, in fiscal year 2024 . Project exit costs from clean energy generation and distribution projects totaled approximately $4.6 billion . $1.7 billion of the remaining charge related to severance and other employee benefits under a global cost reduction program .\n In April 2025, we completed the sale of our 100% ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary in Singapore for cash proceeds of $104.3 . We recognized a gain of $67.3 ($51.9 after tax) in connection with the transaction during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 . No shareholder activism-related charges were recorded during the fourth quarter .\n Other income of $110.1 increased 89%, or $51.9.9% . The increase was primarily driven by a $31.3 gain ($23.8 after tax, or $0.11 per share) on the sale of a regional office in Hersham, England, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 .\n Operating margin was negative 7.3% compared to 36.9% in the prior year . Operating income of $2.9 billion decreased 3%, or $89.8, due to lower volumes and higher costs . Higher pricing primarily from non-helium merchant products favorably impacted operating results by $55, net of power and fuel costs .\n Operating income of $2.6 increased $76.4 from an expense of $73.8 in the prior year . De-designated interest rate swaps related to financing for the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project resulted in an unrealized gain of $27.0 ($7.2 attributable to Air Products after tax, or $0.03 per share) in fiscal year 2025 .\n The loss in fiscal year 2025 was primarily attributable to after-tax charges for business and asset actions . Adjusted EBITDA of $5.1 billion increased 1%, or $30.1, as higher pricing and productivity improvements were partially offset by lower volumes and fixed-cost inflation . The effective tax rate equals the income tax expense (benefit) divided by income or loss before taxes .\n The prior year effective tax rate included impacts from the $1.6 billion gain on the sale of the LNG business during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 . The related net tax benefit of these actions totaled $695.2, which includes an $11.3 cost for reserves established for uncertain tax positions related to the deductibility of the amount of the charges incurred in foreign subsidiaries .\n During fiscal year 2025, we recorded costs of $86.3 related to a proxy contest as further discussed in Note 25,  Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements . We recognized an income tax benefit of $14.6 primarily related to costs for legal and other professional service fees and incremental proxy solicitation costs related to the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders .\n OBBBA did not have a material impact on our fiscal year 2025 results and is expected to primarily affect future fiscal years . Sales of $5.1 billion increased 2%, or $85.8, as higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 4% and higher pricing of 2% were partially offset by lower volumes of 3% and an unfavorable currency impact .\n Operating margin of 29.6% decreased 150 bp from 31.1% in the prior year . Lower helium demand also contributed to the volume decline, despite a significant, non-recurring helium sale to an existing merchant customer in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 . Equity affiliates’ income of $157.0 decreased 1%, or $1.8, driven by our share of income from an asset sale .\n Sales of $3.3 billion increased 1%, or $46.7, as higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 2% was partially offset by lower pricing of 1% . Operating margin of 26.0% decreased 60 bp from 26.6% in the prior year . Equity affiliates’ income of $42.3 increased 29% or $9.4, driven by prior year maintenance expense .\n Operating margin of 28.3% decreased 40 bp from 28.7% in the prior year . Operating income of $844.7 increased 4%, or $34.7, due to favorable pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $42 and favorable currency of $14, partially offset by an unfavorable business mix of $13.8 . Sales of $135.9 increased 1% or $1.5, primarily due to higher volumes .\n We present certain financial measures, other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, on an \"adjusted\" or \"non-GAAP\" basis . On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\") adjusted EBITDA, adjusted effective tax rate, and capital expenditures . Equity affiliates' income of $12.4 decreased 39%, or $8.0, driven by lower contributions from an affiliate in Algeria .\n Non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAap adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance . The net impact of non-service related components is reflected within “Other non-operating income (expense), net” on our consolidated income statements .\n The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future . The tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact . We may also exclude certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions and impairment charges as well as gains on disclosed transactions, such as the sale of the LNG business .\n Affiliates' adjusted net loss is based on a diluted weighted average share count of 222.9 million . FY2025 vs. FY2024 GAAP measures are based on the diluted share count . Adjusted net loss of $5,343.1 vs. $4,466.1 GAAP: $2,857.7/2025 GAAP Measures: $3,947.5/2024 Adjusted Measures: $2,768.6/2023 Adjusted Loss/Loss: $1,842.1/1923/1922/14/23/14 .\n The table below reconciles GAAP operating margin to adjusted operating margin, illustrating the impact of non-GAAP adjustments on our reported margins . Margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period . As a result, individual components may not sum to totals due to rounding .\n Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance on both a consolidated and a segment basis . The tables below present a reconciliation of consolidated net income (loss) on a GAAP basis to consolidated adjusted EBITda: $354.4-$3,862.4 Less: Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization expense, net, and other non-operating income (expense) expense .\n The effective tax rate equals the income tax expense (benefit) divided by income or loss from continuing operations before taxes . We calculate our adjusted effective tax rates by adjusting the numerator and denominator to exclude the tax and before tax impacts of our non-GAAP adjustments, respectively . The table below presents a reconciliation of the GAAP effective tax .\n The company's capital expenditures are a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as the sum of cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, acquisitions (less cash acquired), investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates, and investment in financing receivables on our consolidated statements of cash flow .\n We believe we have sufficient cash, cash flows from operations, and access to funding sources to meet our liquidity needs . Capital expenditures reflect the portion of \"Additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits\" that is associated with NGHC, less our approximate cash investment in the joint venture . We do not expect a significant portion of the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates to be subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation .\n In fiscal year 2024, cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.6 billion . This included a gain related to the sale of the LNG business as discussed in Note 4,  . The adjustment for deferred income taxes of $554.8 was largely attributable to tax impacts associated with these costs . Payables and accrued liabilities were a use of cash of $224.0, primarily due to payments for contract terminations associated with business and asset actions .\n Working capital changes in fiscal year 2024 resulted in a net use of cash of $183.0 . Business and asset actions of $57.0 reflected expenses recognized for severance and other benefits associated with our global cost reduction plan . An inventory-related cash use of $137.8 was largely attributable to helium purchases .\n The primary use of cash was $7.0 billion for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, of which approximately $3 billion related to the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project . Additional uses included investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates of $390.4, investments in financing receivables of $61.9 and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $59.9 .\n The components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below . Capital expenditures totaled $5.1 billion in fiscal year 2025, a 2% decrease from fiscal year 2024 . The $390.4 investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates included approximately $238 related to BHIG and $115 for our final investment in the JIGPC joint venture .\n It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities . Management is unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity . We exited the World Energy sustainable aviation fuel project in fiscal year 2025 . We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2026 to be approximately $4 billion .\n In fiscal year 2025, cash provided by financing activities was $2.8 billion . The primary source of cash was long-term debt proceeds of  $4.4 billion . Net proceeds from the notes were used to repay commercial paper obligations . An additional  $1.6 billion in project financing was provided through project financing available to the NGHC joint venture .\n In fiscal year 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $2.6 billion . The primary source of cash was long-term debt proceeds of $4.7 billion . These sources of cash were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of  $1.6bn . Total debt increased to $17.7bn as of 30 September 2025 from $14.2bn . The company also received $428.5 in contributions from noncontrolling interests, primarily related to NGHC .\n Air Products' debt included related party debt of $236.5 and $304.4 as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively . As of September 2025, we were in compliance with all the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements . We repaid at maturity $550.0 aggregate principal amount of our 1.50% senior notes due October 2025 .\n Certain of our foreign subsidiaries maintain access to committed credit facilities with a combined maximum borrowing capacity of $394.0 . The amount borrowed from available facilities as of 30 September 2024 was $1.1 billion, which included long-term borrowings of approximately $675 that were derecognized upon deconsolidation of BHIG during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 .\n The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.79 per share that was payable on 10 November 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 1 October 2025 . The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and U.K. pension plan . The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of plan expense and contributions .\n The amount of service costs capitalized in fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was not material . Service costs result from benefits earned by active employees . The lower non-service related costs are the result of higher expected return on plan assets from increases in the return assumption and a decrease in actuarial loss amortization . In fiscal year 2026, we expect to recognize pension expense of approximately $30 to $40, which includes approximately $10 to $20 of non-Service related costs .\n The plan funded status is calculated as the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at the end of the period . The net unfunded liability of $67.7 as of 30 September 2025 increased $23.4 from $44.3 . The interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost was greater than decreases to the projected benefits from actuarial gains due to higher discount rates .\n For fiscal year 2026, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $25 to $35 . Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors . These estimates reflect our best judgment about current and/or future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements .\n Plant and equipment recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method . Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us . Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location .\n Our regional industrial gas segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases . As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term . We continue to depreciate assets that are temporarily idle. Depreciation is discontinued when assets meet the criteria for classification as held for sale .\n The review also led to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment in one of our joint ventures, as discussed under \"Impairment of Assets: Equity Method Investments\" No triggering events were identified in fiscal year 2025 that would require impairment testing for any of our reporting units containing goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets . Plant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell .\n An estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists . Factors that management must estimate include but are not limited to industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, and inflation . The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review .\n For assets that met the held-for-sale criteria and are actively being marketed, observable market prices were not available . Fair value less cost to sell was estimated using various data points, including an offer to purchase the facility, amounts due from the customer if the customer was contractually required to repurchase the asset . An impairment loss of $350.6 was recognized to reduce the long-lived assets held for sale to their estimated fair value, net of estimated selling costs, of $418.3 .\n The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets . Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price, plus the fair . value of any noncontrolling interest and . previously held equity interest in the acquiree . The majority of ou had five reportable business segments, six operating segments and 10 reporting units .\n As part of annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value . An impairment loss will only be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit .\n Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists . An impairment loss will only be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total carrying value . See the impairment discussion above for a description of how impairment losses are determined .\n The majority of our equity method investments are ventures with other industrial gas companies . An impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs . Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee could result in an impairment charge .\n We use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations . Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer . When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded .\n Changes to project revenue and cost estimates unfavorably impacted operating results by approximately $85 in fiscal year 2025 . We produce and supply gases under long-term contracts from large facilities that we build, own, and operate on or near the customer’s facilities . Certain of these contracts contain complex terms and provisions regarding tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, variable components, pricing provisions, and amendments .\n The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions . A 1% increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income, respectively, of approximately $4.2 billion . A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized .\n Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans . We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase . Actual results could vary from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover rates .\n The rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date . A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense . A 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase, respectively, to pension expense of approximately $18 per year .\n The company accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated . Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1,  previously, to the consolidated financial statements . The market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value .\n Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates . We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments . We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss .\n Our net financial instrument position increased from a liability of approximately $13.9 billion at 30 September 2024 to approximately $17.2 billion . The increase was primarily due to the issuance of Euro- and U.S. Dollar-denominated senior fixed-rate notes during the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2025 .\n The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices . The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model . For additional information regarding deconsolidation of BHIG, refer to Note 6, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements .\n A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $565 and $408 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2025 and 2024 . The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates . The primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Chinese Renminbi and U.S. Dollar .\n The majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the United States . The Chinese Renminbi and the Euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings . We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the Chinese RMB or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $50 and $34, respectively .\n Deloitte & Touche LLP has issued its opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of 30 September 2025 . Management evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control based on criteria established in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)\n Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of September 30, 2025 and 2024 . The financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company . The Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting, based on criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission .\n Management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting . We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) We are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB .\n A company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles . Because of its inherent limitations, internal control may not be able to detect unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements .\n The critical audit matter relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements . Revenue associated with these contracts is generally recognized over time during the period in which the Company delivers or makes available the agreed upon quantity of gases . On-site industrial gas customer contracts involve large capital investments to serve customers who require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand .\n We identified revenue recognition for certain on-site industrial contracts with complex terms and provisions as a matter of audit matter . These terms include tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, and provisions that are specific to a particular arrangement . We agreed the amount of revenue recognized to these contracts, including the amount and timing of revenue recognition . We also agreed that the terms included in these contracts should be applied to the contract .\n The Company has served as the Company's auditor since 2018 . Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries have served as Deloitte & Touche LLP's auditors since 2018. The Company's net income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, is $3,842.1 per share . The company has incurred $12,037.3 per share in the fiscal year ended 30 September .\n The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements . Earnings (loss) per share is calculated independently for each component and may not sum to total earnings (loss), per share due to rounding . Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries' combined net income (Loss) is $394394.5-395.5.5% .\n The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements . Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.  $18.1.1 per share, $17.5.5 per share and $1,856.0 per share . The company's current current and noncurrent assets are $5,825.8 per share; $2,979.7 per share.\n The Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries' shareholders' Equity, at cost (2025 -   26,867,328,328 shares; 2024 -  -  27,083,166 shares) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements . Air Products Shareholders’ Equity (A) Includes balances associated with a consolidated variable interest entity .\n For the Fiscal Years Ended 30 September, Air Products reported net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Air Products was $3,862.4 billion . Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of continuing operations was $2,338.6 billion . Air Products' net loss was $1,842.1 billion, less than $1.2 billion in the last three years .\n The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements . The Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries have issued the following statements . At the end of the fiscal year, the company reported $1,856.0 billion in cash and cash items . The company announced the results of the company's fiscal year ending 30 September .\n Shareholders’ share price is $2,300.2.2 billion . The company’s net income is $15,660.3 billion . It is $1,967.4 billion annually . The Company paid $1.9 billion in dividends and $2.5 billion in noncontrolling interests .\n The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements . Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries have disclosed noncash activity related to the NEOM Green Hydrogen Company joint venture . The company's net income (loss) was $17,036.5 million . The balance as of 30 September 2025 will be $18,673.7 million .\n Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., a Delaware corporation founded in 1940, is a world-leading industrial gases company that has built a reputation for its innovation, operational excellence, and commitment to safety and environmental stewardship . We serve a broad range of industries, including refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, medical, and food, providing essential industrial gases, related equipment, and applications expertise .\n The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) The notes that follow are an integral part of our consolidated financial statement . These notes, unless otherwise indicated, are presented on a continuing operations basis . The results of operations and cash flows for our discontinued operations have been segregated from the results of continuing operations and segment results .\n We are the primary beneficiary of the NEOM Green Hydrogen Company and consolidate the joint venture within our Middle East and India segment . For consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, the outside shareholders’ interests are reflected as non-controlling interests on our consolidated financial statements . We recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied, which occurs when control is transferred to the customer .\n Our contracts within the scope of revenue guidance do not contain payment terms that include a significant financing component . Consistent with industry business practice, we generally do not accept sales returns or provide return allowances . Revenue from our sale of equipment contracts is generally recognized over time . Amounts billed for shipping and handling fees are classified as sales in the consolidated income statements .\n Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life . The principal components of selling and administrative expense are costs related to compensation, administrative functions, and professional fees . We record a liability for these benefits when we determine it is probable that the benefits will be paid in an amount that can be reasonably estimated .\n We are required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial measurement or for subsequent accounting or reporting . We do not provide material one-time benefit arrangements . We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better . Management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk is remote, and any losses would be immaterial .\n The following details the accounting treatment of our cash flow, fair value, net investment, and non-designated hedges . Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets the cash flow hedge criteria are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCL\") to the extent effective and then recognized in earnings when the hedged items affect earnings .\n In most of our foreign operations, the local currency is considered the functional currency . Foreign subsidiaries translate their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date . Gains and losses from these foreign currency transactions are generally reflected in \"Other income (expense), net\" on our consolidated income statements .\n iabilities, intercompany and third-party financing transactions, and the impact of related hedges are reflected within “Other non-operating income (expense), net\" Foreign currency forward points and currency swap basis differences that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness of our cash flow hedges of intercompany loans are recorded .\n We expense environmental costs related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible . Remediation costs are capitalized if the costs improve our property as compared with the condition of the property when originally constructed or acquired . An environmental liability related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, site investigation and testing costs .\n Management has an established process in place to identify and monitor our environmental exposures . An environmental accrual analysis is prepared and maintained that lists all environmental loss contingencies . The accruals for environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets . They do not consider any claims for recoveries from insurance or other parties and are not discounted .\n The accrual for a litigation loss contingency includes estimates of potential damages and other directly related costs expected to be incurred . We expense the grant-date fair value of our share-based awards over the vesting period during which employees perform related services . Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible individuals who would meet requirements for vesting of awards upon their retirement .\n \"Other non-operating income (expense), net\" includes interest income associated with cash and cash items and short-term investments . The company has elected as an accounting policy to account for Global Intangible Low Tax Income (“GILTI”) The position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized .\n When extending credit, we evaluate customer creditworthiness based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors that include, but are not limited to, the customer’s credit score from external providers, financial condition, and past payment experience . The assessment of the likelihood of default is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience, economic conditions, and forward-looking information .\n We review our reserves for credit losses on a quarterly basis . The allowance on lease receivables was not material as of 30 September 2025 and 2024 . In fiscal year 2025, we recorded a $300-a-year allowance for credit loss related to a financing receivable in connection with our exit from the sustainable aviation fuel expansion project with World Energy .\n We write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or when inventories become unmarketable based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions . We apply the equity method of accounting when we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not control the operating and financial decisions of an investee . The carrying value of our equity method investments is reflected as \"Investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates\" on our consolidated balance sheets .\n Capitalized costs include purchased computer software packages, payments to vendors/consultants for development and implementation or modification to a purchased package to meet our requirements . Construction costs, labor, and applicable overhead related to installations are capitalized . Expenses for additions and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are expensed as incurred .\n As lessee, we recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms in excess of 12 months . ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease .\n Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred . There is no difference in revenue recognition over the life of the contract as compared to accounting for the contract under a sale of gas agreement . There have been no new arrangements that qualified as a lessor in fiscal year 202 .\n Some of our acquisitions include terms that provide the seller with both the right to receive all output from the acquired asset for an agreed upon term . We evaluate the contract terms to determine whether we have obtained control of the underlying asset, or the transaction qualifies as a financing arrangement . For transactions that qualify as financing arrangements, we record our investment as a finance receivable, net of any allowances for credit losses .\n In fiscal year 2025, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets associated with exited projects . A portion of the related plant and equipment is capable of being marketed through secondary equipment channels but did not meet the criteria for classification as held for sale . The fair value of the disposal group is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis .\n The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values . Any excess purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest) over the fair market value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill . Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired .\n In fiscal year 2025, no triggering events were identified that would require impairment testing for any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets . Indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired . The cost of benefits we contribute to defined contribution plans is recognized in the year earned .\n FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\". We adopted the update upon its effective date in fiscal year 2025 and implemented the expanded disclosure requirements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K .\n In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740—Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, to expand income tax disclosures . The update will be effective in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending 30 September 2026, although early adoption is permitted . We are evaluating the impact this update will have on our disclosures .\n The FASB issued ASU 2025-09, “Measurement of Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets” The update will be effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2027, although early adoption is permitted . At this time, we do not expect it will have a material impact on our financial statements .\n Air Products is an equal owner in NGHC with our joint venture partners, ACWA Power and NEOM Company . We have no equity interest in World Energy, LLC, but hold a variable interest through a financing receivable that was fully reserved in fiscal year 2025 in connection with our exit from the SAF expansion project . We consolidate NGHC within the Middle East and India segment .\n In May 2023, NGHC finalized the $6.7.7 billion engineering, procurement, and construction agreement naming Air Products as the main contractor and system integrator for the facility . Total principal borrowings were $4.9.9 billion and $3.3 billion as of 30 September 2025 and 2024 . The remaining borrowings are from long-term facilities .\n NGHC entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps designed to hedge the long-term variable rate debt facilities available under the project financing during the construction period of the project . We discontinued cash flow hedge accounting for certain swaps during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to changes in the anticipated drawdown timeline for the hedged borrowings . As additional borrowings are drawn, the unamortized balance is reclassified as an offset to the outstanding debt .\n The green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility is being constructed on land owned by our joint venture partner, NEOM Company . The remaining de-designated swaps will continue to be excluded from hedge accounting until additional borrowings align with their notional amounts, at which point they may re-qualify for cash flow hedge accounting .\n JIGPC entered into project financing to purchase power blocks, gasifiers, air separation units, syngas cleanup assets, and utilities to supply electricity, steam, hydrogen to Aramco’s refinery and terminal complex . The carrying value of our investment, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, totaled $3.1 billion .\n Air Products' total investment in JIGPC primarily consists of shareholder loans that qualify as in-substance common stock . Certain shareholders receive a preferred cash distribution pursuant to the joint venture agreement, which specifies each shareholder’s share of income after considering the amount of cash available for distribution . The earnings attributable to Air Products may not be proportionate to our ownership interest in the venture .\n During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we terminated the MPA and announced our decision to exit the project . In connection with this decision, we recorded project exit charges totaling approximately $1.9.9 billion . The charges included approximately $2.6 billion to write down assets that had been reflected within \"Plant and equipment, net\" The remaining charge reflects estimated costs to terminate contractual commitments and satisfy other obligations associated with exiting the site .\n The sale of our liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") process technology and equipment business to Honeywell International Inc. for approximately $1.2.2 billion after tax . The LNG business did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation because the disposal did not represent a strategic shift that had or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results .\n In fiscal year 2025, Air Products recognized project exit costs totaling approximately $3.6.6 billion . Air Products exit costs were driven by challenging commercial conditions, unfavorable regulatory actions, project-specific economic factors, and slower-than-temporary economic factors . Of the total charge, approximately $2.4 billion related to our decision to exit  U.S.-based projects within our Americas segment in the second quarter .\n These actions did not result in the impairment of goodwill or intangible assets . As of 30 September 2025, our consolidated balance sheet included assets held for sale of $427.7 trillion . The remaining amount primarily relates to other assets associated with our exit from the sustainable aviation fuel expansion project with World Energy . Total cash outflows are projected to be approximately $395 trillion once the exit strategy is fully implemented .\n We expect to complete the sales of these plants in fiscal year 2026 . Any gain or loss from the sales will be recognized at the time of the transaction based on the carrying amounts classified as held for sale . The held-for-sale assets and the marketable plant and equipment were subject to Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant unobservable inputs .\n In June 2023, we initiated a global cost reduction plan that provides severance and other postemployment benefits to employees designated for involuntary separation . The assets written off included those related to our withdrawal from coal gasification in Indonesia as well as a project in Ukraine that was permanently suspended due to Russia's invasion of the country . The remaining liability as of 30 September 2025 primarily relates to employees identified during fiscal year 2025 .\n Air Products acquired a 100% interest in Ijsfabriek Strombeek, an independent industrial gases company located in Belgium . Total consideration, net of cash acquired, was $705.2-74.2 per cent, which included $59.9 per cent paid in cash at closing . We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination within our Europe segment . The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes .\n We are accounting for the transaction as a financing arrangement as we did not obtain accounting control of the facility due to UNG having the unilateral right to reacquire the facility at the end of the contract term . Amounts paid in connection with the facility are reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows within \"Investment in financing receivables\" in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 .\n As a result of the transaction, APQ no longer holds a controlling financial interest in BHIG . The assets and liabilities associated with the entity were derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 . APQ recorded an equity method investment for APQ's 50% interest in the entity .\n The majority of our revenue is generated from our sale of gas customers within these regional industrial gases segments . We distribute product to our industrial gas customers through either our on-site or merchant supply mode depending on various factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location . Gases are produced and supplied through large facilities constructed or acquired on or near customer facilities .\n Sales of both liquid bulk and packaged gases do not include minimum purchase requirements, as they are governed by contracts and/or purchase orders that reflect the customer's specific needs . Performance obligations associated with this supply mode are satisfied at a point in time when the customer receives and obtains control of the product . We mitigate energy and natural gas price risk contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, and cost pass-through arrangements .\n Revenue from our sale of equipment contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use . The company's revenue is satisfied at the point in time the customer obtains control of the equipment, which is generally determined based on the shipping terms of the contract .\n The tables below present our consolidated sales disaggregated by supply mode for each of our reportable segments . We believe this presentation best depicts the nature, timing, type of customer, and contract terms for our sales . Corporate segment included the liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment business, which was sold to Honeywell International Inc. on 30 September 2024 .\n As of 30 September 2025, the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is estimated to be approximately $26 billion . This amount includes fixed-charge contract provisions associated with our on-site and sale of equipment supply modes . We estimate that approximately half of this revenue will be recognized over the next five years and the balance thereafter .\n Contract assets primarily relate to our sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time . These balances represent unbilled revenue, which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds the amount invoiced to our customers . Costs to obtain a contract, or \"contract acquisition costs,\" are capitalized at the time we establish a contract with the customer .\n During the fiscal year ended 30 September 2025, we recognized sales of approximately $9.6 per cent. of equipment projects as balances associated with our sale of gas contracts are generally related to fixed charges and are relatively consistent period over period. Advanced payments from our customers do not represent a significant financing component as these payments are intended for purposes other than financing, such as to meet working capital demands .\n The loss did not impact the statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2024 . As of 30 September 2025, all of our equity method investments are foreign affiliates . In fiscal year 2023, net income from discontinued operations of $7.4.4 was driven by a net tax benefit recognized during the fourth quarter upon the release of tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions associated with the sale of the Performance Materials Division .\n The summarized financial information presented below is on a combined 100% basis and has been compiled based on the financial statements of our equity affiliates . We recorded an equity method investment for a 51%-owned consolidated subsidiary's interest in the Blue Hydrogen Industrial Gases Company joint venture following a deconsolidation event in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 . As of 30 September 2025 and 2024, the amount of investment in companies accounted for by the equity method included equity method goodwill .\n Our investment in JIGPC was completed in stages to align with the joint venture’s acquisition of project assets, beginning with an initial investment of $1.6.6 billion in fiscal year 2022 . The second investment is reflected within \"Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates\" on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2023 .\n The major classes of plant and equipment are as follows: The depreciable lives of production facilities related to long-term customer supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives . Depreciation expense was $1,526.9,478.6, and $1.325.8 in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively .\n We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable . The impairment test for goodwill involves an optional assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value .\n The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves an optional assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value . Indefinite-lived assets are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists . For details on the amortization periods applicable to each major class of intangible assets, refer to Note 1, \n The company is the lessee under various agreements for real estate, vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment that are accounted for as operating leases . Our finance leases principally relate to the right to use machinery and equipment and are not material. indefinite-lived intangible asset was greater than its carrying value. The following maturity analysis of our operating lease liabilities as of 30 September 2025 presents the undiscounted cash flows for each of the next five years .\n \"Lease receivables, net\" relate to sales-type leases on certain on-site assets for which payments are collected over the contract term . The majority of our leases are of high credit quality and were originated prior to fiscal year 2017 . Payments in fiscal year 2023 included a lump-sum payment of $209.209 for a land lease associated with the NGHC joint venture .\n The credit quality of lease receivables did not require a material allowance for credit losses . As of 30 September 2025, minimum lease payments expected to be collected were as follows: 2026/2023/2025/2024/24/25/24: 2023/25: 2025/23: Lease receivable, net, net: $356.5/25; $356/23/24; $487/23; $129/23-24/19: 20%/20%/25%/24%; $298/23%/19%/50%/30%/10%/13%/14%/15%/12%/2014/15/13/14/13: 10%\n The maximum remaining term of any forward exchange contract currently outstanding and designated as a cash flow hedge at 30 September 2025 is  2.5 years . The primary currency pair in this portfolio of forward exchange contracts is the U.S. Dollar and Chilean Peso . We also utilize forward exchange . contracts that are not designated as hedges are used to economically hedge foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities .\n The designated foreign currency-denominated debt is presented on our consolidated balance sheets within \"Long-term debt\" as of 30 September 2025 and \"Current portion of long-term . debt\" at 30 September 2024 . We manage our debt portfolio and hedging program with the intent to (1) reduce funding risk with respect to borrowings made by us .\n As of 30 September 2025, the outstanding interest rate swaps were denominated in U.S. dollars . The notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements is equal to or less than the designated debt being hedged . It is our policy not to enter into any interest rate management contracts which lever a move in interest rates on a greater than one-to-one basis .\n The current cross currency interest rate swap portfolio consists of fixed-to-fixed swaps primarily between the U.S. Dollar and each of the Chinese Renminbi, Chilean Peso, and Indian Rupee . The current cash flow hedge accounting for certain instruments that will remain de-designated until outstanding borrowings from the available financing are commensurate with the notional value of the instruments .\n The tables below summarize the fair value and balance sheet location of our outstanding derivatives . Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments: Forward exchange contracts, Current portion of long-term debt, current assets, current liabilities, current interest rate management contracts, current receivables and current assets and current liabilities .\n The tables below summarize gains (losses) recognized in other comprehensive income during the period related to our net investment and cash flow hedging relationships . Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, describes the method for measuring fair value and provides additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements . Other primarily includes the recognition of our share of gains and losses, net of tax, related to interest rate swaps held by our equity affiliates .\n The table below summarizes the location and amounts recognized in income related to our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments by contract type . The table includes the amount of loss recognized in earnings based on amortization approach . Loss of Cash Flow Hedging: The Effects of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments: The Amount Reclassified from OCI to Income .\n The amount of unrealized gains and losses related to cash flow hedges as of 30 September 2025 that are expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months is not material . The cash flows related to derivative contracts are generally reported in the operating activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows . The net liability position of derivatives with credit risk-related contingent features was $.3.3\n Fair value is defined as an exit price, or the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows .\n The fair value of our debt is based on estimates using standard pricing models that consider the value of future cash flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value . These standard valuation models utilize observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot rates . On an ongoing basis, we randomly test a subset of our valuations against valuations received from the transaction’s counterparty .\n The table below summarizes assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis . e carrying amounts for cash and cash items, short-term investments, trade receivables, payables and accrued liabilities, and accrued income taxes, have been excluded from the above table . The assets included:Forward exchange contracts, long-lived assets associated with exited projects .\n The impairment loss was recognized as the difference between the estimated liquidation value and the net book value of the assets as of 31 March 2025 . t to complete the sale of these assets in fiscal year 2026 . Plant and equipment that do not meet the held for sale criteria but are capable of being sold through secondary equipment markets were evaluated for recoverability .\n In February 2025, we issued Euro-denominated senior fixed-rate notes with an aggregate principal amount of €.0.0-billion (approximately $1.0.-billion) in a registered public offering (the \"February 2025 Offering\") The related proceeds were reduced by deferred financing charges and discounts of approximately $.2 billion . As of 30 September 2024, total debt owed to related parties was $.4.4 trillion .\n Variable rates are determined as of 30 September 2025. rrent portion and amounts owed to related parties . Variable rates for senior U.S. dollar notes are determined at the rate of $7.6 per cent . Maturities range from $25,000 to $100,000 per annuities of $20,000 .\n In February 2024, we issued green senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion in a registered public offering . All proceeds have been disbursed or allocated to eligible projects that are expected to have environmental benefits as defined under our Green Finance Framework . Principal maturities of long-term debt in each of the next five years are as follows .\n As of 30 September 2025, we were in compliance with all the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements . Capitalized interest represents the portion of interest incurred that we include in the cost of new plant and equipment that we build during the year . Cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized, was $192.2.2%, $198.2%, and $.131.5% in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively .\n Certain of our foreign subsidiaries maintain access to committed credit facilities . During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we receive long-term borrowings from two Saudi Riyal-denominated facilities upon deconsolidation of BHIG . As of 30 September 2024, these facilities had a combined maximum borrowing capacity of $1.2.2 trillion .\n The components of net periodic cost for our defined benefit pension plans for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 were as follows:. The amount of service costs capitalized in fiscal years . The non-service related impacts are presented outside operating income within \"Other non-operating income (expense), net\" Certain of our pension plans provide for a lump sum benefit payment option .\n The projected benefit obligation (\"PBO\") is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of estimated future salary increases . The following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic cost for a given fiscal year based on assumptions developed at the end of the previous fiscal year .\n The changes in plan assets and benefit obligation that have been recognized in other comprehensive income on a pretax basis during fiscal years 2025 and 2024 consist of the following: 2025.2-2024.2.3.5.5-2025.1.5 . 2025/2024/2025/25/24.5: Change in Plan Assets: $2,533.0-$1,374.0.0/2,500/1,400/2.5/10: $1,338.7/10/14/2026/2027/2030/24: $3,500,000/10,000.\n The net actuarial gains and losses represent the actual changes in the estimated obligation and plan assets that have not yet been recognized in the consolidated income statements . Actuarial losses arising during fiscal year 2025 are primarily attributable to lower than expected returns on plan assets . The accumulated benefit obligation (\"ABO\") is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee service rendered to a particular date .\n The tables above include several pension arrangements that are not funded because of jurisdictional practice . The U.S. and U.K. plans' investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives to manage interest and inflation exposure . Equity investments are diversified geographically and by investment style and market capitalization . Fixed income portfolios may include investment grade and high yield investments in sovereign, corporate, emerging market debt, asset-backed securities .\n As of 30 September 2025, the U.S. and international pension plans were within the allowable target allocation ranges . We continue to monitor the investment portfolios and various investment markets and will take action accordingly . Assets are routinely rebalanced through contributions, benefit payments, and otherwise as deemed appropriate . In determining the estimated long-term asset class returns, we take into account historical returns of asset classes .\n The table below summarizes pension plan assets measured at fair value by asset class (see Note 16, Fair Value Measurements, for definition of the levels): U.S. Qualified Pension Plans at Fair Value: $2,409.0/1,409/2,533/1 September . The table includes pension assets measured by assets, including real estate pooled funds, fixed income and fixed income securities .\n Alternative credit pooled funds in our U.S. plans allow for monthly redemption with approximately 30 days' notice . Timing for redemption could be delayed based on the priority of our request and the availability of funds . Interests in these funds are valued using the net asset value (\"NAV\") per share practical expedient and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy .\n Fixed income pooled funds are classified as Level 2 assets since the NAV of these assets is based on quoted market pricing from observable pricing sources or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields, credit ratings, or factors as of the reporting date . Alternative credit pooled funds may hold high yield bonds, emerging market debt, loans, structured credit, distressed and convertible debt, private credit, and other instruments .\n Insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 assets, as they are carried at contract value, which approximates the estimated fair value . Pension contributions for funded plans resulted primarily from contractual and regulatory requirements . Benefit payments to unfunded plans were due primarily to the timing of retirements . The Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan was established in May of 2002 .\n We treat dividends paid on ESOP shares as ordinary dividends . Under existing tax law, we may deduct dividends which are paid with respect to shares held by the plan . Shares of our common stock in the ESOP totaled 1,501,888,888 as of 30 September 2025 . The cost of these benefits was not material in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 .\n We are involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, competition, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, product liability, and insurance matters . We do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings for which it is reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows . The Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense issued a decision against our Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies .\n There are sites on which a final settlement or remediation has not been achieved where we, usually along with others, have been designated as a potentially responsible party by environmental authorities . We continually monitor these sites for which we have environmental exposure . Accruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and amount of loss can be reasonably estimated .\n We do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year . We are required by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to continue our remediation efforts at the Pace facility .\n We have implemented many of the remedial corrective measures at the Pace facility required under the 1995 consent orders issued by the FDEP and the USEPA . Several groundwater recovery systems have been installed to contain and remove contamination from groundwater . There have been no significant changes to the estimated exposure. roundwater recovery system and future annual costs due to higher inflation .\n Piedmont, South Carolina, site is under active remediation for contamination caused by an insolvent prior owner . Site is required by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control to address both contaminated soil and groundwater . We estimate that source area remediation and groundwater recovery and treatment will continue through 2033 . Thereafter, we currently expect this site to go into a state of monitored natural attenuation through 2038 .\n Management committed to permanently shutting down our polyurethane intermediates production facility in Pasadena, Texas . In shutting down and dismantling the facility, we have undertaken certain obligations related to soil and groundwater contaminants . We have been pumping and treating groundwater to control off-site contaminant migration in compliance with regulatory requirements . We estimate that the pump and treat system will continue to operate until 2042 .\n In 2012, we estimated the total exposure at this site to be $13.2 billion . There have been no significant changes to the estimated exposure . The timing and/or method of settlement of these obligations are conditional on a future event that may not be within our control . We do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with warranties and guarantees will have a material adverse effect .\n The provision for estimated future costs relating to warranties is not material to our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations . We issued performance guarantees as a condition of project financing associated with the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project that would require us to pay up to approximately $0.8 billion in the event of nonperformance in our role as EPC contractor .\n Approximately $5.0 billion of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium . The majority of these obligations occur after fiscal year 2030 . Helium purchases include crude feedstock supply to helium refining plants in North America as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world . As a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector, these helium sourcing agreements are medium- to long-term and contain take-if-tendered provisions .\n The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0.0 billion of our outstanding common stock . As of 30 September 2025,  numerous common shares were issued, with around 223 miles issued and outstanding . There were  no preferred stock Shares issued or outstanding in fiscal year 2025 and 2024 . The Board has not purchased any of its outstanding shares under this program since 2013 .\n The amount of share-based compensation cost capitalized in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 was not material . Deferred stock units issued to outside directors are paid after their service on the Board of Directors ends at the time elected by the director . We generally expense the grant-date fair value of awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period .\n The fair value of market-based deferred stock units was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as these equity awards are tied to a market condition . We generally expense the grant-date fair value  on a straight-line basis over the vesting period . The calculation of the fair value used the following assumptions:Expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield .\n A summary of deferred stock unit activity in fiscal year 2025 is presented below . As of 30 September 2025, there was $68.5% of unrecognized compensation cost related to deferred stock units . The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 was $10.5%, $39.1% of the tax benefit realized from option exercises . We have not issued stock option awards since fiscal year 2015 .\n The table below summarizes changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCL\"), net of tax, attributable to Air Products: Derivatives, as hedges and postretirement benefits . Air Products reclassified from AOCL: Derivatives apologetic qualifying premium hedge as hedges; Pension and post-retirement benefits; Reclassifications reclassified as affected line item on the consolidated income statements .\n The components of net periodic benefit cost reclassified out of AOCL include items such as actuarial loss amortization, settlements, settlements and curtailments . Air Products' net loss (loss) per share was $386.5 to $2,842.1 per share . Net periodic benefit costs were reclassified as “Other non-operating income (expense), net’s) on the consolidated income statements .\n The diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if share-based awards were exercised or converted into common stock . The dilutive effect is computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes all share based awards are exercised and the hypothetical proceeds from exercise are used by the Company to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period .\n The United States enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act” or \"Tax Reform\") on 22 December 2017 . Income tax payments increased in fiscal year 2025 primarily due to tax payments of approximately $395.395 per cent related to the gain on the sale of the LNG business . Cash paid for taxes (Net of Cash Refunds) were $940.7%, $.615.9%, and $.645.2 in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively .\n The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes . A reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and effective tax rates is provided below . The effective rate was influenced by pre-tax charges of approximately $3.7.7 billion related to our decision to exit various projects and other cost reduction measures .\n Pre-tax charges for business and asset actions in fiscal year 2023 totaled $244.6                . These charges included certain losses for which we could not recognize an income tax benefit and were subject to a valuation allowance . Partially offsetting the valuation allowance cost was a $15.9                 income tax benefit from a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary . Tax costs related to non-deductible amounts are included within \"Business and asset action\" in our effective tax rate reconciliation .\n Equity affiliates’ income, which is primarily presented net of income taxes on our consolidated income statements, favorably impacts our effective tax rate . Foreign tax holidays relate to operations in jurisdictions that provide reduced income tax rates for certain qualifying activities and are conditioned upon us satisfying certain requirements . These holidays are effective through fiscal years 2030 and 2033, and may be extended . The impact of these tax holidays decreased foreign taxes by $30.3.3%, $25.7%, and $395% for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively .\n The deferred tax assets for \"Revenue recognition\" were impacted by increases in revenue recognized for income tax purposes in advance of GAAP .
