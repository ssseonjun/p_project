QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFinancial Instruments and Risk Management\nMarket Price Sensitive Investments\nThe fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $10 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2024 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $313 million and $314 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings.\nNon-Publicly Traded Equity Securities\nAbbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $91 million and $88 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $20 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nInterest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts with notional values totaling $2.2 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $13.7 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.8% and 3.6% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.2 billion. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values.\nForeign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott held $7.0 billion and $7.3 billion of notional values, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2024 will mature in 2025 or 2026 depending on the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2023 matured in 2024 or will mature in 2025 depending upon the contract. \nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott held $16.2 billion and $13.8 billion of notional values, respectively, of such contracts, which mature within 13 months.\nAbbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $583 million and $419 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt \nis due to\n \nnet incremental borrowing of $201 million, discussed in Note 10 — Debt and Lines of Credit, as well as changes in foreign exchange rates, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.\n.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n2024\n2023\n(dollars in millions)\nContract\nAmount\nWeighted\nAverage\nExchange\nRate\nFair and\nCarrying Value\nReceivable/\n(Payable)\nContract \nAmount\nWeighted\nAverage\nExchange\nRate\nFair and\nCarrying Value\nReceivable/\n(Payable)\nPrimarily U.S. dollars to be exchanged for the following currencies:\nEuro\n$\n10,954 \n1.0848 \n$\n136 \n$\n9,221 \n1.0865 \n$\n(35)\nChinese Yuan\n1,926 \n7.1132 \n22 \n2,115 \n7.0785 \n3 \nJapanese Yen\n1,479 \n149.1298 \n51 \n1,635 \n138.2288 \n24 \nAll other currencies\n8,832 \nn/a\n50 \n8,189 \nn/a\n(54)\nTotal\n$\n23,191 \n$\n259 \n$\n21,160 \n$\n(62)\n39\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.

accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\n46\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 — \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNATURE OF BUSINESS — Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.\n \nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES — The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for sales rebates, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefits, valuation of intangible assets, litigation, derivative financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION — The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n \nREVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer’s normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. In certain Abbott businesses, primarily within diagnostics, Abbott participates in selling arrangements that include multiple performance obligations (e.g., instruments, reagents, procedures, and service agreements). The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation.\n \nINCOME TAXES — Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when the taxes are paid. No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GILTI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE — Unvested restricted stock units and awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities.\n  Net earnings allocated to common shares in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n13.351\n billion, $\n5.701\n billion and $\n6.905\n billion, respectively.\nPENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS — Abbott accrues for the actuarially determined cost of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a \nfive-year\n period. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method.\n47\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS — For assets and liabilities that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, adjusted for contract restrictions and other terms specific to that asset or liability. For these items, a significant portion of fair value is derived by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For all remaining assets and liabilities, fair value is derived using a fair value model, such as a discounted cash flow model or Black-Scholes model. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value. The fair value of significant purchased intangible assets is based on independent appraisals. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION — The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards and units are amortized over their requisite service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible, with a charge to compensation expense.\nLITIGATION — Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. Legal fees are recorded as incurred.\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS — Cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits, U.S. government securities, money market funds and U.S. treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less. Abbott holds certain investments with a carrying value of $\n139\n million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments held in a rabbi trust and investments in publicly traded equity securities are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\nTRADE RECEIVABLE VALUATIONS — Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. Accounts receivable are charged off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.\nINVENTORIES — Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost includes material and conversion costs.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT — Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. \nThe following table shows estimated useful lives of property and equipment:\nClassification\nEstimated Useful Lives\nBuildings\n10\n to \n50\n years\nEquipment\n2\n to \n20\n years \nPRODUCT LIABILITY — Abbott accrues for product liability claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The liabilities are adjusted quarterly as additional information becomes available. Product liability losses are self-insured.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS — Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.\n48\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) — The initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.\nCONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES — Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. Product warranties are not significant.\nAbbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events.\nNote 2 — \nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n, which expands the breadth and frequency of required segment disclosures. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2024. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's consolidated financial statements, but required additional disclosures, retrospectively applied to all periods presented in Note 16 \n—\n Segment and geographic area information. \nIn September 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04, \nDisclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n, which requires an entity to report information about its supplier finance program. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nIncome Statement (Subtopic 220-40): Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures\n, which requires an entity to disclose on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about specific income statement expense categories. The guidance should be applied prospectively with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2027 reporting. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, which requires an entity to disclose annually additional information related to the company's income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid during the period. The guidance should be applied prospectively with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2025 reporting. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nNote 3 — \nRevenue\nAbbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has \nfour\n reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.\n49\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 3 — Revenue (Continued)\nThe following tables provide detail by sales category:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nU.S.\n \nInt’l\nTotal\nU.S.\nInt’l\nTotal\nU.S.\nInt’l\nTotal\nEstablished Pharmaceutical Products — \nKey Emerging Markets\n$\n—\n \n$\n3,858\n \n$\n3,858\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,807\n \n$\n3,807\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,766\n \n$\n3,766\n \nOther\n—\n \n1,336\n \n1,336\n \n—\n \n1,259\n \n1,259\n \n—\n \n1,146\n \n1,146\n \nTotal\n—\n \n5,194\n \n5,194\n \n—\n \n5,066\n \n5,066\n \n—\n \n4,912\n \n4,912\n \nNutritional Products —\nPediatric Nutritionals\n2,208\n \n1,815\n \n4,023\n \n1,977\n \n1,957\n \n3,934\n \n1,562\n \n1,919\n \n3,481\n \nAdult Nutritionals\n1,481\n \n2,909\n \n4,390\n \n1,436\n \n2,784\n \n4,220\n \n1,357\n \n2,621\n \n3,978\n \nTotal\n3,689\n \n4,724\n \n8,413\n \n3,413\n \n4,741\n \n8,154\n \n2,919\n \n4,540\n \n7,459\n \nDiagnostic Products — \nCore Laboratory\n1,332\n \n3,903\n \n5,235\n \n1,243\n \n3,916\n \n5,159\n \n1,137\n \n3,751\n \n4,888\n \nMolecular\n150\n \n371\n \n521\n \n172\n \n402\n \n574\n \n370\n \n625\n \n995\n \nPoint of Care\n408\n \n180\n \n588\n \n396\n \n169\n \n565\n \n372\n \n153\n \n525\n \nRapid Diagnostics\n1,940\n \n1,057\n \n2,997\n \n2,518\n \n1,172\n \n3,690\n \n6,652\n \n3,409\n \n10,061\n \nTotal\n3,830\n \n5,511\n \n9,341\n \n4,329\n \n5,659\n \n9,988\n \n8,531\n \n7,938\n \n16,469\n \nMedical Devices —\nRhythm Management\n1,154\n \n1,236\n \n2,390\n \n1,085\n \n1,170\n \n2,255\n \n1,029\n \n1,090\n \n2,119\n \nElectrophysiology\n1,141\n \n1,326\n \n2,467\n \n1,008\n \n1,187\n \n2,195\n \n909\n \n1,018\n \n1,927\n \nHeart Failure\n986\n \n293\n \n1,279\n \n888\n \n273\n \n1,161\n \n809\n \n226\n \n1,035\n \nVascular\n1,056\n \n1,781\n \n2,837\n \n978\n \n1,703\n \n2,681\n \n864\n \n1,619\n \n2,483\n \nStructural Heart\n1,051\n \n1,195\n \n2,246\n \n883\n \n1,061\n \n1,944\n \n818\n \n894\n \n1,712\n \nNeuromodulation\n767\n \n195\n \n962\n \n725\n \n165\n \n890\n \n619\n \n151\n \n770\n \nDiabetes Care \n2,633\n \n4,172\n \n6,805\n \n2,129\n \n3,632\n \n5,761\n \n1,633\n \n3,123\n \n4,756\n \nTotal\n8,788\n \n10,198\n \n18,986\n \n7,696\n \n9,191\n \n16,887\n \n6,681\n \n8,121\n \n14,802\n \nOther\n16\n \n—\n \n16\n \n14\n \n—\n \n14\n \n11\n \n—\n \n11\n \nTotal\n$\n16,323\n \n$\n25,627\n \n$\n41,950\n \n$\n15,452\n \n$\n24,657\n \n$\n40,109\n \n$\n18,142\n \n$\n25,511\n \n$\n43,653\n \nNote: The Acelis Connected Health business was internally transferred from Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure on January 1, 2023. As a result, $\n115\n million of sales in 2022 were moved from Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure.\nProducts sold by the Diagnostics segment include various types of diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $\n747\n million in 2024, $\n1.6\n billion in 2023 and $\n8.4\n billion in 2022.\n50\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 3 — Revenue (Continued)\nAbbott recognizes revenue from product sales upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. For maintenance agreements that provide service beyond Abbott’s standard warranty and other service agreements, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. A time-based measure of progress appropriately reflects the transfer of services to the customer. Payment terms between Abbott and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant.\nManagement exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Abbott provides rebates to government agencies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other private entities.\nRebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from \none\n to \nsix months\n after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income.\nOther allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within \n15\n to \n30\n days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott’s historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant.\nAbbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott uses an expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2024, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $\n5.5\n billion in the Diagnostic Products segment and approximately $\n440\n million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately \n56\n percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next \n24\n months, approximately \n17\n percent over the subsequent \n12\n months and the remainder thereafter. \nThese performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above.\nAssets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nAbbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining or renewing contracts with customers are incremental to obtaining the contract. Abbott capitalizes these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from \ntwo\n to \nten years\n. The amounts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not significant.\n51\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 3 — Revenue (Continued)\nAdditionally, the cost of transmitters provided to customers that use Abbott’s remote monitoring service with respect to certain medical devices are capitalized as contract costs. Capitalized transmitter costs are amortized based on the timing of the transfer of services to which the assets relate, which typically ranges from \neight\n to \nten years\n. The amounts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not significant.\nOther Contract Assets and Liabilities\nAbbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant.\nContract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. \nChanges in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows:\n(in millions)\nContract Liabilities:\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n500\n \nUnearned revenue from cash received during the period\n469\n \nRevenue recognized related to contract liability balance\n(\n424\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n545\n \nUnearned revenue from cash received during the period\n483\n \nRevenue recognized related to contract liability balance\n(\n460\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n568\n \nNote 4 — \nSupplemental Financial Information\nOther (income) expense, net\n, for 2024, 2023 and 2022 include\ns approximately $\n542\n million, $\n498\n million and $\n406\n million of income, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs ass\nociated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Abbott sold a non-core business related to its Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. Abbott recorded a loss of approximately $\n143\n million on the sale in \nOther (income) expense, net\n in its Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net assets which primarily related to inventory and net property and equipment and had a carrying value of $\n28\n million were included in the sale.

Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances.\nThe detail of various balance sheet components is as follows:\n(in millions)\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nLong-term Investments:\nEquity securities\n$\n553\n \n$\n555\n \nOther\n333\n \n244\n \nTotal\n$\n886\n \n$\n799\n \nThe increase in Abbott’s long-term investments as of December 31, 2024 versus the balance as of December 31, 2023 primarily relates to investment in long term deposits and equity method investments, partially offset by the impairment of certain securities. \nAbbott’s equity securities as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, include $\n313\n million and $\n314\n million, respectively, of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency.\nAbbott also holds certain investments as of December 31, 2024 with a carrying value of $\n139\n million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of $\n91\n million that do not have a readily determinable fair va\nlue. \n(in millions)\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nOther Accrued Liabilities:\nAccrued rebates payable to government agencies\n$\n621\n \n$\n650\n \nAccrued other rebates (a)\n1,098\n \n1,091\n \nAll other \n3,424\n \n3,681\n \nTotal\n$\n5,143\n \n$\n5,422\n \n________________________________________________________\n(a)\nAccrued wholesaler chargeback rebates of $\n262\n million and $\n232\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are netted in trade receivables because Abbott’s customers are invoiced at a higher catalog price but only remit to Abbott their contract price for the products.\n(in millions)\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nPost-employment Obligations and Other Long-term Liabilities:\nDefined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical and dental plans for significant plans\n$\n1,880\n \n$\n1,964\n \nDeferred income taxes\n512\n \n568\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n896\n \n949\n \nAll other (b)\n3,443\n \n3,466\n \nTotal\n$\n6,731\n \n$\n6,947\n \n________________________________________________________\n(b)\nIncludes approximately $\n860\n million and $\n650\n million of net unrecognized tax benefits and $\n210\n million and $\n430\n million of transition tax obligation related to the TCJA in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n53\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 5 — \nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe components of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows:\n(in millions)\nCumulative\nForeign\nCurrency\nTranslation\nAdjustments\nNet Actuarial Gains (Losses) and Prior Service\n(Costs) and\nCredits\nCumulative \nGains (Losses)\non Derivative\nInstruments\nDesignated as\nCash Flow\nHedges\nTotal\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n(\n6,733\n)\n$\n(\n1,493\n)\n$\n175\n \n$\n(\n8,051\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n212\n \n127\n \n5\n \n344\n \n(Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (a)\n17\n \n(\n10\n)\n(\n139\n)\n(\n132\n)\nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss)\n229\n \n117\n \n(\n134\n)\n212\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n(\n6,504\n)\n(\n1,376\n)\n41\n \n(\n7,839\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n(\n1,117\n)\n757\n \n245\n \n(\n115\n)\n(Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (a)\n116\n \n8\n \n(\n76\n)\n48\n \nNet current period other comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n1,001\n)\n765\n \n169\n \n(\n67\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n(\n7,505\n)\n$\n(\n611\n)\n$\n210\n \n$\n(\n7,906\n)\n________________________________________________________\n(a)\nThe reclassification of $\n116\n million out of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in 2024 is included in the loss related to the sale of a non-core business included in Other (income) expense.

(Bigfoot), which furthers Abbott's efforts to develop connected solutions for making diabetes management more personal and precise. The purchase price, the final allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Bigfoot since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\n \n \nOn April 27, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI) for $\n20\n per common share, which equated to a purchase price of \n$\n851\n million\n. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and accounted for as a business combination. CSI's atherectomy system, which is used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease, adds complementary technologies to Abbott's portfolio of vascular device offerings.\n \nThe final allocation of the purchase price of the CSI acquisition resulted in the recording of \ntwo\n non-deductible developed technology intangible assets totaling $\n305\n million; a non-deductible in-process research and development asset of $\n15\n million, which will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation; non-deductible goodwill of $\n369\n million; net deferred tax assets of $\n46\n million and other net assets of $\n116\n million. The goodwill is identifiable to the Medical Devices reportable segment and is attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Revenues and earnings of CSI included in Abbott's consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date are not material to Abbott's consolidated revenue and earnings.\n54\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 7 — \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \nThe total amount of reported goodwill was $\n23.1\n billion at December 31, 2024 and $\n23.7\n billion at December 31, 2023. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by $\n533\n million in 2024 and increased goodwill b\ny $\n304\n million in 2023. \nIn 2023, business acquisitions increased goodwill by approximately $\n576\n million. \nThe amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at December 31, 2024 was $\n2.6\n billion for the Estab\nlished Pharmaceutical Products segment, $\n285\n million for the Nutritional Products segment, $\n3.5\n billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $\n16.8\n billion for the Medical Devices segment. There were \nno\n reductions of goodwill relating to impairments in 2024 and 2023.\n \nThe gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $\n27.1\n billion and $\n27.7\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectivel\ny. In 2023, the gross amount of amortizable intangible assets increased by $\n305\n million due to a business acquisition. Accumulated amortization was\n \n$\n21.3\n billion\n \nand $\n19.7\n billion as of\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, respectively. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $\n78\n million in 2024 and increased intangible assets by $\n44\n million in 2023. In 2024, \nintangible assets\n decreased $\n207\n million due to impairment charges recorded on the Cost of products sold line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, primarily related to the Medical Devices reportable segment\n. \nThe estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2024 is approximately $\n1.7\n billion in 2025, $\n1.5\n billion in 2026, $\n1.2\n billion in 2027, $\n668\n million in 2028 and $\n605\n million in 2029. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over \n2\n to \n20\n years.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&D acquired in a business combination, were approximately  $\n784\n million and $\n787\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2024, IPR&D decreased by $\n39\n million of charges recorded on the Research and development line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the Medical Devices reportable segment and was partially offset by an increase of $\n35\n million\n \ndue to the finalization of purchase accounting related to a business acquisition. In 2023, $\n100\n million of impairment charges related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets in the M\nedical Devices reportable segment were recorded on the \nResearch and development\n line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In 2023, business acquisitions increased IPR&D assets by $\n80\n million.\n \n55\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 8 — \nRestructuring Plans\nIn 2024, Abbott management approved plans to streamline certain operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its Diagnostic, Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceutical and Nutritional businesses, including the discontinuation of its ZonePerfect\n®\n product line.

Stock options and restricted stock awards and units comprise the majority of benefits that have been granted and are currently outstanding under this program and a prior program. In 2024, Abbott granted \n1,683,097\n stock options, \n404,597\n restricted stock awards and \n5,341,050\n restricted stock units under this program.\nUnder Abbott’s stock incentive programs, the purchase price of shares under option must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the maximum term of an option is \n10\n years. Options generally vest equally over \nthree years\n. Restricted stock awards generally vest over \nthree years\n, with no more than one-third of the award vesting in any \none year\n upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target. Restricted stock units vest over \nthree years\n and upon vesting, the recipient receives \none\n share of Abbott stock for each vested restricted stock unit. The aggregate fair market value of options and restricted stock awards and units is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which may be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant. Restricted stock awards and settlement of vested restricted stock units are issued out of treasury shares. Abbott generally issues new shares for exercises of stock options. As a policy, Abbott does not purchase its shares relating to its share-based programs.\nIn April 2017, Abbott’s shareholders authorized the 2017 Incentive Stock Program under which a maximum of \n170\n million shares were available for issuance. At December 31, 2024, approximately \n61\n million shares remained available for future issuance.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2024.\n(intrinsic values in millions)\nOptions\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise Price\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nLife (Years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n28,569,075\n \n$\n74.52\n \n4.8\n$\n1,073\n \nGranted\n1,683,097\n \n116.88\n \nExercised\n(\n3,593,503\n)\n47.26\n \nLapsed\n(\n111,920\n)\n119.40\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n26,546,749\n \n$\n80.70\n \n4.6\n$\n906\n \nExercisable at December 31, 2024\n22,712,676\n \n$\n75.20\n \n3.9\n$\n897\n \nThe following table summarizes restricted stock awards and units activity for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nShare Units\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n10,278,286\n \n$\n112.51\n \nGranted\n5,745,647\n \n116.78\n \nVested\n(\n4,978,325\n)\n115.35\n \nForfeited\n(\n536,036\n)\n112.82\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n10,509,572\n \n$\n113.48\n \nThe fair market value of restricted stock awards and units vested in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n570\n million, $\n536\n million and $\n639\n million, respectively.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n238\n million, $\n102\n million and $\n85\n million, respectively.

The repayment equated to approximately $\n640\n million. On November 30, 2023, Abbott repaid the $\n1.05\n billion outstanding principal amount of its \n3.40\n% Notes upon maturity. On September 27, 2023, Abbott repaid the €\n1.14\n billion outstanding principal amount of its \n0.875\n% Notes upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $\n1.2\n billion. In September 2023, Abbott repaid approximately $\n197\n million of debt assumed as part of a recent business acquisition. \nOn June 26, 2024, Abbott modified its existing, yen-denominated \n5\n-year term loan scheduled to mature in November 2024. The amended terms include a net increase in principal debt from ¥\n59.8\n billion to ¥\n92.0\n billion, with a new maturity date in June 2029. The modified, \n5\n-year term loan bears interest at the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) plus a fixed spread, and the interest rate is reset quarterly. The net proceeds equated to approximately $\n201\n million.\nAbbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $\n5\n billion on an unsecured basis. On January 29, 2024, Abbott terminated its 2020 \nFive Year\n Credit Agreement (2020 Agreement) and entered into a new \nFive Year\n Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement). There were \nno\n outstanding borrowings under the 2020 Agreement at the time of its termination. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on January 29, 2029 and will bear interest, at Abbott’s option, based on either a base rate or Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings.\nPrincipal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 are $\n1.5\n billion in 2025, $\n2.9\n billion in 2026, $\n617\n million in 2027, $\n650\n million in 2028, $\n583\n million in 2029 and $\n8.0\n billion in 2030 and thereafter.\nAt December 31, 2024, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by S&P Global Ratings and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating.\nNote 11 — \nLeases\nLeases where Abbott is the Lessee\nAbbott has entered into operating leases as the lessee for office space, manufacturing facilities, R&D laboratories, warehouses, vehicles and equipment. Finance leases are not significant. Abbott’s operating leases generally have remaining lease terms of \n1\n to \n10\n years. Some leases include options to extend beyond the original lease term, generally up to \n10\n years and some include options to terminate early. These options have been included in the determination of the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\nFor all of its asset classes, Abbott elected the practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC No. 842, “Leases” to account for each lease component (e.g., the right to use office space) and the associated non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) as a single lease component. Abbott also elected the short-term lease accounting policy for all asset classes; therefore, Abbott is not recognizing a lease liability or right of use (ROU) asset for any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that Abbott is reasonably certain to exercise.\nAs Abbott’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the interest rate used to determine the present value of the payments under each lease typically reflects Abbott’s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. \n59\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 11 — Leases (Continued)\nThe following table provides information related to Abbott’s operating leases:\n(in millions, except weighted averages)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating lease cost (a)\n$\n366\n \n$\n356\n \n$\n355\n \nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities\n300\n \n276\n \n274\n \nROU assets arising from entering into new operating lease obligations\n253\n \n253\n \n263\n \nWeighted average remaining lease term at December 31 (in years)\n7\n7\n8\nWeighted average discount rate at December 31\n3.6\n \n%\n3.4\n \n%\n2.9\n \n%\n________________________________________________________\n(a)\nIncludes short-term lease expense and variable lease costs, which were immaterial in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n(in millions)\n2025\n$\n290\n \n2026\n252\n \n2027\n183\n \n2028\n134\n \n2029\n103\n \nThereafter\n356\n \nTotal future minimum lease payments – undiscounted\n1,318\n \nLess: imputed interest\n(\n168\n)\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n$\n1,150\n \nThe following table summarizes the amounts and location of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities:\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nBalance Sheet Caption\nOperating Lease - ROU Asset\n$\n1,075\n \n$\n1,122\n \nDeferred income taxes and other assets\nOperating Lease Liability:\n \nCurrent\n$\n254\n \n$\n245\n \nOther accrued liabilities\nNon-current\n896\n \n949\n \nPost-employment obligations and other long-term liabilities\nTotal Liability\n$\n1,150\n \n$\n1,194\n \nLeases where Abbott is the Lessor\nCertain assets, primarily diagnostics instruments, are leased to customers under contractual arrangements that typically include an operating or sales-type lease as well as performance obligations for reagents and other consumables. Sales-type leases are not significant. Contract terms vary by customer and may include options to terminate the contract or options to extend the contract. Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g., reagent) sales. The allocation of revenue between the lease and non-lease components is based on standalone selling prices. Operating lease revenue represented less than \n3\n percent of Abbott’s total net sales in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n60\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 11 — Leases (Continued)\nAssets related to operating leases are reported within Net property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $\n3.9\n billion and $\n1.8\n billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNote 12 — \nFinancial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $\n7.0\n billion at December 31, 2024, and $\n7.3\n billion at December 31, 2023, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2024 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next \ntwelve\n to \neighteen months\n.\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Abbott held gross notional amounts of $\n16.2\n billion and $\n13.8\n billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. \nAbbott has designated a yen-denominated, \n5\n-year term loan of approximately $\n583\n million and $\n419\n million as of December 31, 2024 and  December 31, 2023, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt is due to the net incremental borrowing of $\n201\n million discussed in Note 10 — Debt and Lines of Credit, as well as changes in foreign exchange rates, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. \nAbbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. Abbott had interest rate contracts totaling approximately $\n2.2\n billion at December 31, 2024 and  2023. \n61\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 12 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of December 31:\nFair Value — Assets\nFair Value — Liabilities\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nBalance Sheet Caption\n2024\n2023\nBalance Sheet Caption\nInterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:\nNon-current\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nDeferred income taxes and other assets\n$\n51\n \n$\n95\n \nPost-employment obligations and other long-term liabilities\nCurrent\n1\n \n—\n \nPrepaid expenses and other receivables\n—\n \n—\n \nOther accrued liabilities\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts:\nHedging instruments\n243\n \n88\n \nPrepaid expenses and other receivables\n19\n \n134\n \nOther accrued liabilities\nOthers not designated as hedges\n147\n \n81\n \nPrepaid expenses and other receivables\n112\n \n97\n \nOther accrued liabilities\nDebt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary\n— \n— \nn/a\n583\n \n419\n \nLong-term debt (Current portion of long-term debt in 2023)\n$\n391\n \n$\n169\n \n$\n765\n \n$\n745\n \nThe following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income. \nGain (loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (loss)\nIncome (expense) and Gain (loss) Reclassified into Income\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome Statement Caption\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges\n$\n347\n \n$\n(\n22\n)\n$\n281\n \n$\n103\n \n$\n187\n \n$\n234\n \nCost of products sold\nDebt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary\n37\n \n27\n \n75\n \n n/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nInterest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges\n n/a\nn/a\nn/a\n44\n \n61\n \n(\n243\n)\nInterest expense\nA gain of $\n131\n million, a loss of $\n44\n million and a gain of $\n70\n million were recognized in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as hedges.

The fair value of the debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. \nContingent consideration relates to businesses acquired by Abbott. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. The decrease in the amount of contingent consideration from December 31, 2023 reflects a payment of $\n40\n million and a $\n34\n million change in the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration. The maximum amount for certain contingent consideration is not determinable as it is based on a percent of certain sales. Excluding such contingent consideration, the maximum amount that may be due under the other contingent consideration arrangements was estimated at December 31, 2024 to be approxima\ntely $\n65\n million, w\nhich is dependent upon attaining certain sales thresholds or upon the occurrence of certain events, such as regulatory approvals.\n \nNote 13 — \nLitigation and Environmental Matters\nAbbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $\n4\n million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $\n10\n million.\nAbbott has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging that its preterm infant formula and human milk fortifier products that contain cow’s milk cause an intestinal disease known as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and inadequately warn about the risk of NEC. These lawsuits claim that certain preterm infants suffered injury or death as a result of contracting NEC. In a trial held in July 2024, a jury in a Missouri state court awarded a plaintiff $\n495\n million in damages. Abbott stands by its products and the information it provided about them, and it appealed this jury’s verdict with the Missouri Court of Appeals in December 2024. In a trial held in October 2024 involving Abbott and another infant formula manufacturer and the treating hospital as co-defendants, a jury in a Missouri state court returned a unanimous verdict for Abbott and its co-defendants. In December 2024, the plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial. Abbott does not believe that it is probable that a material loss will be incurred related to these lawsuits and therefore, \nno\n reserves have been recorded. Given the uncertainty as to the possible outcome in each of these lawsuits, Abbott is unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss related to these lawsuits.\nAbbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $\n25\n million to $\n35\n million. The recorded accrual balance at December 31, 2024 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $\n30\n million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations, except for the cases discussed in the second paragraph of this note, the resolution of which could be material to Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\n64\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 — \nPost-Employment Benefits \nRetirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution and medical and dental plans. \nInformation for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows:\nDefined Benefit Plans\nMedical and Dental\nPlans\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nProjected benefit obligations, January 1\n$\n10,030\n \n$\n9,167\n \n$\n1,181\n \n$\n1,126\n \nService cost — benefits earned during the year\n242\n \n230\n \n39\n \n38\n \nInterest cost on projected benefit obligations\n469\n \n455\n \n54\n \n59\n \n(Gains) losses, primarily changes in discount rates, plan design changes, law changes and differences between actual and estimated health care costs\n(\n763\n)\n458\n \n(\n33\n)\n35\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n398\n)\n(\n377\n)\n(\n73\n)\n(\n77\n)\nOther, including foreign currency translation\n(\n130\n)\n97\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \nProjected benefit obligations, December 31\n$\n9,450\n \n$\n10,030\n \n$\n1,166\n \n$\n1,181\n \nPlan assets at fair value, January 1\n$\n13,085\n \n$\n11,373\n \n$\n288\n \n$\n302\n \nActual return (loss) on plan assets\n1,259\n \n1,611\n \n26\n \n26\n \nCompany contributions\n349\n \n349\n \n36\n \n37\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n398\n)\n(\n377\n)\n(\n73\n)\n(\n77\n)\nOther, including foreign currency translation\n(\n152\n)\n129\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPlan assets at fair value, December 31\n$\n14,143\n \n$\n13,085\n \n$\n277\n \n$\n288\n \nProjected benefit obligations less (greater) than plan assets, December 31\n$\n4,693\n \n$\n3,055\n \n$\n(\n889\n)\n$\n(\n893\n)\nLong-term assets\n$\n5,724\n \n$\n4,164\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nShort-term liabilities\n(\n38\n)\n(\n36\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nLong-term liabilities\n(\n993\n)\n(\n1,073\n)\n(\n887\n)\n(\n891\n)\nNet asset (liability)\n$\n4,693\n \n$\n3,055\n \n$\n(\n889\n)\n$\n(\n893\n)\nAmounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss):\nActuarial losses, net\n$\n772\n \n$\n1,751\n \n$\n29\n \n$\n62\n \nPrior service costs (credits)\n5\n \n6\n \n(\n8\n)\n(\n22\n)\nTotal\n$\n777\n \n$\n1,757\n \n$\n21\n \n$\n40\n \nThe $\n763\n million of defined benefit plan gains and $\n33\n million of medical and dental plan gains in 2024 that decreased the projected benefit obligations primarily reflect the year-over-year increase in the discount rates used to measure the obligations.

The net actuarial gains in 2024 related to defined benefit plans are primarily due to the favorable impact of actual asset returns in excess of expected returns and the year-over-year increase in discount rates. The net actuarial gain in 2024 related to medical and dental plans is primarily due to the year-over-year increase in discount rates.

The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet.\nEquities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. For approximately half of these funds, investments may be redeemed once per week or month, with a required \n2\n to \n30\n day notice period. For the remaining funds, daily redemption of an investment is allowed. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did \nno\nt have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Fixed income securities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required \n2\n to \n60\n day notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily.\nAbsolute return funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Abbott did \nno\nt have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from \n5\n to \n90\n days. For approximately $\n300\n million of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a \n25\n percent gate and $\n60\n million is subject to a lock u\nntil 2025. \nAll private funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund on a one-quarter lag adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through the reporting date. \nInvestments in the private funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2025 to 2034. Abbott’s unfunded commitment in these funds was $\n540\n million and $\n555\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The plans do not directly hold any securities of Abbott. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plans’ assets. Abbott’s medical and dental plans’ assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company’s targeted asset allocation percentages.\n68\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued)\nThe plans’ expected return on assets, as shown above, is based on management’s expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions.\nAbbott funds its domestic pension plans according to U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. Abbott funded $\n349\n million in 2024 and 2023 to defined pension plans. Abbott expects to contribute approximately $\n302\n million to its pension plans in 2025.\nTotal benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which includes payments funded from company assets, as well as paid from the plans, are as follows:\n(in millions)\nDefined\nBenefit Plans\nMedical and\nDental Plans\n2025\n$\n412\n \n$\n64\n \n2026\n431\n \n69\n \n2027\n453\n \n73\n \n2028\n475\n \n78\n \n2029\n500\n \n82\n \n2030 to 2034\n2,856\n \n455\n \nThe Abbott Stock Retirement Plan is the principal defined contribution plan. Abbott’s contributions to this plan were $\n207\n million in 2024, $\n199\n million in 2023 and $\n190\n million in 2022.\nNote 15 — \nTaxes on Earnings \nTaxes on earnings reflect the annual effective rates, including charges for interest and penalties. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts.\nTaxes on earnings include approximately $\n50\n million, $\n22\n million and $\n43\n million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, taxes on earnings in 2024, 2023 and 2022 also include approximately $\n25\n million, $\n80\n million and $\n20\n million of net tax expense, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2024, taxes on earnings includes $\n7.5\n billion in non-cash valuation allowance adjustments resulting from the restructuring of certain foreign affiliates and the confirmation of certain tax filing positions. The restructuring improved profitability to several of Abbott’s affiliates and management concluded that the related preexisting deferred tax assets, which historically had a full valuation allowance, were more likely than not to be realizable in future periods. In particular, Abbott considered the likelihood of sustained ongoing profitability of the affiliates as a positive factor that outweighed all available negative evidence considered. Accordingly, Abbott released the full valuation allowance on such deferred tax assets and recorded the offset to tax expense.  \nThe TCJA includes a one-time transition tax that is based on Abbott’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining balance of Abbott’s transition tax obligation related to the TCJA is approximately $\n432\n million, which will be paid over the next \ntwo years\n as allowed by the TCJA. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. \n69\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 15 — Taxes on Earnings (Continued)\nIn the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. In September 2023, Abbott received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (SNOD) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2019 Federal tax year in the amount of $\n417\n million. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD relate to the reallocation of income between Abbott’s U.S. entities and its foreign affiliates. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit, in part because certain adjustments contradict methods that were agreed to with the IRS in prior audit periods. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2023.\nIn June 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2017 and 2018 Federal tax years in the amount of $\n192\n million. The matters proposed in the 2017/2018 SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2019 SNOD. Abbott filed a petition in September 2024 with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the 2017/2018 SNOD in a manner consistent with its petition for the 2019 SNOD.\nIn October 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2020 Federal tax year assessing an additional $\n443\n million of income tax. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2017/2018 and 2019 SNODs. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments and omissions that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. In addition to the tax assessment for the 2020 tax year, the 2020 SNOD also contested a deduction for which an estimated $\n440\n million cash tax benefit would be available in a different taxable year as allowed under applicable U.S. tax law. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2024.\nAbbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the IRS, the IRS independent appeals process and/or through litigation as necessary. Abbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate.\nThere are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which Abbott expects to be individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) has proposed a two-pillared plan for a revised international tax system. Pillar 1 proposes to reallocate taxing rights among the jurisdictions in which in-scope multinational corporations operate. Abbott is continuing to analyze the Pillar 1 proposal. Pillar 2 proposes to assess a 15 percent minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Numerous countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar 2 model rules. The enactment of current Pillar 2 model rules did not and is not projected to have a material impact to Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\n70\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 15 — Taxes on Earnings (Continued)\nEarnings before taxes, and the related provisions for taxes on earnings, were as follows:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEarnings Before Taxes:\nDomestic\n$\n947\n \n$\n1,192\n \n$\n3,732\n \nForeign\n6,066\n \n5,472\n \n4,574\n \nTotal\n$\n7,013\n \n$\n6,664\n \n$\n8,306\n \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTaxes on Earnings:\nCurrent:\nDomestic\n$\n497\n \n$\n528\n \n$\n1,309\n \nForeign\n1,075\n \n874\n \n723\n \nTotal current\n1,572\n \n1,402\n \n2,032\n \nDeferred:\nDomestic\n(\n459\n)\n(\n382\n)\n(\n610\n)\nForeign\n(\n7,502\n)\n(\n79\n)\n(\n49\n)\nTotal deferred\n(\n7,961\n)\n(\n461\n)\n(\n659\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n6,389\n)\n$\n941\n \n$\n1,373\n \nDifferences between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate were as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStatutory tax rate on earnings\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nImpact of foreign operations\n(\n1.8\n)\n(\n3.6\n)\n(\n2.5\n)\nForeign-derived intangible income benefit\n(\n2.3\n)\n(\n2.2\n)\n(\n2.0\n)\nValuation allowance adjustments\n(\n107.1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nExcess tax benefits related to stock compensation\n(\n0.7\n)\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n0.5\n)\nResearch tax credit\n(\n1.0\n)\n(\n1.1\n)\n(\n0.9\n)\nResolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years\n0.4\n \n1.2\n \n0.2\n \nIntercompany restructurings and integration\n0.2\n \n(\n1.4\n)\n—\n \nState taxes, net of federal benefit\n0.3\n \n0.5\n \n0.7\n \nAll other, net\n(\n0.1\n)\n—\n \n0.5\n \nEffective tax rate on earnings\n(\n91.1\n)\n%\n14.1\n \n%\n16.5\n \n%\nImpact of foreign operations is primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malta and Malaysia.\n71\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 15 — Taxes on Earnings (Continued)\nThe tax effect of the differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nCompensation and employee benefits\n$\n—\n \n$\n89\n \nTrade receivable reserves\n230\n \n221\n \nResearch and development costs\n773\n \n568\n \nInventory reserves\n168\n \n198\n \nLease liabilities\n265\n \n272\n \nDeferred intercompany profit\n284\n \n283\n \nNOLs, reserves not currently deductible, credit carryforwards and other\n10,353\n \n9,922\n \nTotal deferred tax assets before valuation allowance\n12,073\n \n11,553\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n1,664\n)\n(\n8,690\n)\nTotal deferred tax assets\n10,409\n \n2,863\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nCompensation and employee benefits\n(\n276\n)\n—\n \nDepreciation\n(\n408\n)\n(\n414\n)\nRight of Use lease assets\n(\n249\n)\n(\n258\n)\nOther, primarily the excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets\n(\n1,365\n)\n(\n1,777\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(\n2,298\n)\n(\n2,449\n)\nTotal net deferred tax assets (liabilities)\n$\n8,111\n \n$\n414\n \nThe following table summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such unrecognized tax benefits were settled:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nJanuary 1\n$\n3,323\n \n$\n2,036\n \nIncrease due to current year tax positions\n167\n \n225\n \nIncrease due to prior year tax positions\n174\n \n1,338\n \nDecrease due to prior year tax positions\n(\n50\n)\n(\n89\n)\nSettlements\n(\n13\n)\n(\n144\n)\nLapse of statute\n(\n33\n)\n(\n43\n)\nDecember 31\n$\n3,568\n \n$\n3,323\n \nAbbott’s unrecognized tax benefits table includes amounts related to tax positions for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognized because the recognition of the future benefit is not expected.  \nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is approximately $\n2.6\n billion. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $\n90\n million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters.\n72\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 16 — \nSegment and Geographic Area Information\nAbbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world.\nAbbott’s reportable segments are as follows:\nEstablished Pharmaceutical Products\n—International sales of a broad line of branded generic pharmaceutical products.\nNutritional Products\n—Worldwide sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products.\nDiagnostic Products\n—Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care testing sites. For segment reporting purposes, the Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics businesses are aggregated and reported as the Diagnostic Products segment. \nMedical Devices\n—Worldwide sales of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care products. For segment reporting purposes, the Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Vascular, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care divisions are aggregated and reported as the Medical Devices segment.\nAbbott’s underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. The chief operating decision maker (CODM) at Abbott is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CODM primarily considers sales and operating margin to assess the performance of segments and to allocate resources, where segment operating margin profitability includes cost of products sold and operating expenses. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment’s assets.\n73\nTable of Contents\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 16 — Segment and Geographic Area Information (Continued)\nThe following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements.\nNet Sales to External Customers (a)\nCost of Products Sold\nResearch and Development\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOperating Earnings (a)\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEstablished Pharmaceuticals\n$\n5,194\n \n$\n5,066\n \n$\n4,912\n \n$\n(\n2,444\n)\n$\n(\n2,357\n)\n$\n(\n2,305\n)\n$\n(\n176\n)\n$\n(\n173\n)\n$\n(\n186\n)\n$\n(\n1,341\n)\n$\n(\n1,330\n)\n$\n(\n1,372\n)\n$\n1,233\n \n$\n1,206\n \n$\n1,049\n \nNutritionals\n8,413\n \n8,154\n \n7,459\n \n(\n4,532\n)\n(\n4,495\n)\n(\n4,314\n)\n(\n209\n)\n(\n204\n)\n(\n191\n)\n(\n2,167\n)\n(\n2,122\n)\n(\n2,248\n)\n1,505\n \n1,333\n \n706\n \nDiagnostics (b)\n9,341\n \n9,988\n \n16,469\n \n(\n4,995\n)\n(\n5,264\n)\n(\n7,287\n)\n(\n656\n)\n(\n698\n)\n(\n777\n)\n(\n1,617\n)\n(\n1,593\n)\n(\n1,765\n)\n2,073\n \n2,433\n \n6,640\n \nMedical Devices (b)\n18,986\n \n16,887\n \n14,802\n \n(\n6,408\n)\n(\n5,803\n)\n(\n4,968\n)\n(\n1,546\n)\n(\n1,362\n)\n(\n1,328\n)\n(\n4,879\n)\n(\n4,416\n)\n(\n4,070\n)\n6,153\n \n5,306\n \n4,436\n \nTotal\n$\n41,934\n \n$\n40,095\n \n$\n43,642\n \n$\n(\n18,379\n)\n$\n(\n17,919\n)\n$\n(\n18,874\n)\n$\n(\n2,587\n)\n$\n(\n2,437\n)\n$\n(\n2,482\n)\n$\n(\n10,004\n)\n$\n(\n9,461\n)\n$\n(\n9,456\n)\n$\n10,964\n \n$\n10,278\n \n$\n12,831\n \nOther\n16\n \n14\n \n11\n \nNet sales\n$\n41,950\n \n$\n40,109\n \n$\n43,653\n \nCorporate functions and plan benefit costs\n(\n422\n)\n(\n308\n)\n(\n509\n)\nNet interest expense\n(\n215\n)\n(\n252\n)\n(\n375\n)\nShare-based compensation\n(\n673\n)\n(\n644\n)\n(\n685\n)\nAmortization of Intangible assets\n(\n1,878\n)\n(\n1,966\n)\n(\n2,013\n)\nOther, net (c)\n(\n763\n)\n(\n444\n)\n(\n943\n)\nEarnings before Taxes\n$\n7,013\n \n$\n6,664\n \n$\n8,306\n \n________________________________________________________\n(a)\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted net sales and operating earnings. \n(b)\n2022 Sales and Operating Earnings for the Diagnostic Products and Medical Devices reportable segments have been updated to reflect the internal transfer of the Acelis Connected Health business from Diagnostic Products to Medical Devices on January 1, 2023.\n(c)\nOther, net includes costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses and restructuring charges in 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Abbott’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nAbbott’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2024, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nAbbott’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 79.\nRobert B. Ford\nChairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\nPhilip P. Boudreau\nExecutive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nJohn A. McCoy, Jr.\nVice President, Finance and Controller\nFebruary 21, 2025\n76\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders’ investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n77\nTable of Contents\nIncome taxes – Unrecognized tax benefits\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $3.6 billion at December 31, 2024. Unrecognized tax benefits are assessed by management quarterly for identification and measurement, or more frequently if there are any indicators suggesting a change in unrecognized tax benefits. Assessing tax positions involves judgment including interpreting tax laws of multiple jurisdictions and assumptions relevant to the measurement of an unrecognized tax benefit, including the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority. These judgments and assumptions can significantly affect unrecognized tax benefits.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in our Audit \nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s identification and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, as well as its process for the assessment of events that may indicate a change in unrecognized tax benefits is warranted. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the completeness of identified unrecognized tax benefits, as well as controls over management’s review of significant assumptions used within the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits.\nWith the support of our tax professionals, among other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s judgment with respect to the interpretation of tax laws of multiple jurisdictions by reading and evaluating management’s documentation, including relevant accounting policies, and by considering how tax laws, including statutes, regulations, and case law, affected management’s judgments. We tested the completeness of management’s assessment of the identification of unrecognized tax benefits including evaluation of the technical merits of the unrecognized tax benefits. We also tested the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and significant assumptions associated with the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, including assessing the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 21, 2025\n78\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \nChicago, Illinois \nFebruary 21, 2025\n79\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9.

Benefits under the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program (the “2009 Program”) include non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards (including stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards), awards to non-employee directors, and foreign benefits. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2009 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares).\nIf there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2009 Program without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program (the “2017 Program”). If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2009 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, \n81\nTable of Contents\nthe shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2009 Program.\nIn April 2017, the 2009 Program was replaced by the 2017 Program. No further awards will be granted under the 2009 Program.\n(ii)\nAbbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program\n. Benefits under the 2017 Program include non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards (including stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards), awards to non-employee directors, and foreign benefits. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2017 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares).\nIf there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2017 Program without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program. If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2017 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program.\n(iii)\nAbbott Laboratories Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees\n. Eligible employees of participating non-U.S. affiliates of Abbott may participate in this plan. An eligible employee may authorize payroll deductions at the rate of 1% to 10% of eligible compensation (in multiples of one percent) subject to a limit of US $12,500 during any purchase cycle.\nPurchase cycles are generally six months long and usually begin on August 1 and February 1. On the last day of each purchase cycle, Abbott uses participant contributions to acquire Abbott common shares. The shares may be either authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares acquired on the open market. The purchase price is typically 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date or on the first day of that purchase cycle. As the number of shares subject to outstanding options is indeterminable, columns (a) and (b) of the above table do not include information on the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate of 7,461,515 common shares were available for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, including shares subject to purchase during the current purchase cycle.\nIn April 2017, the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees was amended and restated as the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees.\nFor additional information concerning the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program, the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program, and the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees, see the discussion in Note 9 entitled “Incentive Stock Program” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n(b)\nInformation Concerning Security Ownership\n.
