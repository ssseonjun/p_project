Ameren’s subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. Dividends on Ameren’s common stock and the payment of expenses by Ameren depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries.\nBelow is a summary description of Ameren’s principal subsidiaries – Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. Ameren also has other subsidiaries that conduct other activities, such as providing shared services. A more detailed description can be found in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\n•\nAmeren Missouri operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution business and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution business in Missouri.\n•\nAmeren Illinois operates rate-regulated electric transmission, electric distribution, and natural gas distribution businesses in Illinois.\n•\nATXI operates a FERC rate-regulated electric transmission business in the MISO.\nFor additional information about the development of our businesses, our business operations, and factors affecting our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nAmeren has four segments: Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Transmission. The Ameren Missouri segment includes all of the operations of Ameren Missouri. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution consists of the electric distribution business of Ameren Illinois. Ameren Illinois Natural Gas consists of the natural gas business of Ameren Illinois. Ameren Transmission primarily consists of the aggregated electric transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI.\nAmeren Missouri has one segment. Ameren Illinois has three segments: Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Illinois Transmission.\n7\nTable\n of Contents\nAn illustration of the Ameren Companies’ reporting structures is provided below:\n(a)    Ameren Missouri consolidates AMF, which is wholly owned by Ameren Missouri.\n(b)    The Ameren Transmission segment also includes allocated Ameren (parent) interest charges, as well as other subsidiaries engaged in electric transmission project development and investment.\nRATES AND REGULATION\nRates\nThe rates that Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are allowed to charge for their utility services significantly influence the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of these companies and Ameren. The electric and natural gas utility industry is highly regulated. The utility rates charged to customers are determined by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC. Decisions by these entities are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, customer intervention, and economic conditions, as well as social and political views. Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding customer rates are largely outside of our control. These decisions, as well as the regulatory lag involved in the process of obtaining approval for new customer rates, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the Ameren Companies. The extent of the regulatory lag varies for each of Ameren’s electric and natural gas jurisdictions, with the Ameren Transmission business experiencing the least amount of regulatory lag. Depending on the jurisdiction, the effects of regulatory lag are mitigated by various means, including annual revenue requirement reconciliations, the decoupling of revenues from sales volumes to ensure revenues approved in a regulatory rate review are not affected by changes in sales volumes, the recovery of certain capital investments between traditional regulatory rate reviews, the level and timing of expenditures, the use of future test years to establish customer rates, and the use of trackers and riders.\nThe MoPSC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Missouri. The ICC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Illinois. The MoPSC and the ICC regulate non-rate utility matters for ATXI. ATXI does not have retail distribution customers; therefore, the MoPSC and the ICC do not have authority to regulate ATXI’s rates. The FERC regulates Ameren Missouri’s, Ameren Illinois’, and ATXI’s cost-based rates for the wholesale transmission and distribution of energy in interstate commerce and various other matters discussed below under General Regulatory Matters.\n8\nTable\n of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the key terms of the rate orders in effect for customer billings for each of Ameren’s utilities as of January 1, 2025, except as noted:\nRate Regulator\nEffective\nRate Order\nIssued In\nRates Effective\nAllowed\nROE\nPercent of\nCommon Equity\nRate Base\n(in billions)\nPortion of Ameren’s 2024 Operating Revenues\n(a)\nAmeren Missouri\nElectric service\n(b)\nMoPSC\nJune 2023\nJuly 2023\n(c)\n(c)\n(c)\n50%\nNatural gas delivery service\nMoPSC\nDecember 2021\nFebruary 2022\n(d)\n(d)\n$0.3\n2%\nAmeren Illinois\nElectric distribution delivery service\n(e)\nICC\nDecember 2024\n(e)\n8.72%\n50.00%\n(e)\n27%\nNatural gas delivery service\n(f)\nICC\nNovember 2023\nNovember 2023\n9.44%\n50.00%\n$2.8\n12%\nElectric transmission service\n(g)\nFERC\n(g)\nJanuary 2025\n10.48%\n54.91%\n$4.4\n6%\nATXI\nElectric transmission service\n(g)\nFERC\n(g)\nJanuary 2025\n10.48%\n60.08%\n$1.6\n3%\n(a)\nIncludes pass-through costs recovered from customers, such as purchased power for electric distribution delivery service and natural gas purchased for resale for natural gas delivery service, and intercompany eliminations.\n(b)\nAmeren Missouri’s electric generation, transmission, and delivery service rates are bundled together and charged to retail customers under a combined electric service rate. Because the bundled rates charged to MoPSC retail customers include the revenue requirement associated with Ameren Missouri's FERC-regulated transmission services, the table above does not separately reflect a FERC-authorized rate base or allowed ROE.\n(c)\nThis rate order did not specify an ROE, capital structure, or rate base.\n(d)\nThis rate order did not specify an ROE or a capital structure.\n(e)\nIn December 2024, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois’ MYRP proceeding. The order approved an average annual rate base for 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 of $4.2 billion, $4.4 billion, $4.6 billion, and $4.8 billion, respectively. Rate changes consistent with the December 2024 order became effective in late December 2024. Under an MYRP, Ameren Illinois will reconcile its actual revenue requirement, as adjusted for certain cost variations, to ICC-approved electric distribution service rates on an annual basis, subject to a reconciliation cap. The reconciliation cap limits the annual adjustment to 105% of the annual revenue requirement approved by the ICC.\n(f)\nThis rate order was based on a 2024 future test year.\n(g)\nTransmission rates are updated annually and become effective each January. They are determined by a company-specific, forward-looking formula ratemaking framework based on each year’s forecasted information. The 10.48% return, which includes a 50-basis-point incentive adder for participation in an RTO, is based on the FERC’s October 2024 order.\nFor additional information on Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI rate matters, see Results of Operations and Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nGeneral Regulatory Matters\nAmeren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive FERC approval to enter into various transactions, such as issuing short-term debt securities and conducting certain acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations. In addition, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive authorization from the applicable state public utility regulatory agency to issue stock and long-term debt securities and to conduct mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other activities.\nAmeren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are also subject to mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards adopted by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the bulk electric power system. These standards are developed and enforced by the NERC, pursuant to authority delegated to it by the FERC. Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are members of the SERC. The SERC is one of six regional entities and represents all or portions of 16 central and southeastern states under authority from the NERC for the purpose of implementing and enforcing reliability standards approved by the FERC. Ameren Missouri is also a member of the MRO, which is also one of the six regional entities and represents all or portions of 16 central, southern, and midwestern states, as well as two Canadian provinces, under authority from the NERC. The regional entities of the NERC work to safeguard the reliability of the bulk power systems throughout North America. If any of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, or ATXI is found not to be in compliance with these mandatory reliability standards, it could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.\nUnder the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, the FERC and the state public utility regulatory agencies in each state Ameren and its subsidiaries operate in may access books and records of Ameren and its subsidiaries that are found to be relevant to costs incurred by Ameren’s rate-regulated subsidiaries that may affect jurisdictional rates. The act also permits the MoPSC and the ICC to request that the FERC review cost allocations by Ameren Services to other Ameren subsidiaries.\nOperation of Ameren Missouri’s Callaway Energy Center is subject to regulation by the NRC. The license for the Callaway Energy Center expires in 2044. Ameren Missouri’s hydroelectric Osage Energy Center and pumped-storage hydroelectric Taum Sauk Energy Center, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to FERC regulations affecting, among other aspects, the general operation and maintenance of the projects. The licenses for the Osage Energy Center and the Taum Sauk Energy Center expire in 2047 and 2044, respectively. Ameren Missouri’s Keokuk Energy Center and its dam on the Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois, and Keokuk, Iowa, \n9\nTable\n of Contents\nare operated under authority granted by an Act of Congress in 1905. The Keokuk Energy Center dam safety program is regulated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.\nFor additional information on regulatory matters, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 9 – Callaway Energy Center, and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur electric generation, transmission, and distribution and natural gas distribution and storage operations must comply with a variety of statutes and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety. These environmental statutes and regulations are comprehensive and include the storage, handling, and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances, emergency planning and response requirements, limitations and standards applicable to discharges from our facilities into the air or water that are enforced through permitting requirements, and natural resource protection laws, including those related to endangered species. Federal and state authorities periodically review and modify existing regulations and adopt new regulations, which may impact our planning process and the ultimate implementation of these or other new or revised regulations. Recent and potential new executive orders issued by the current federal administration as well as local and state land use requirements can also impact our planning activities.\nFor discussion of environmental matters, including NO\nx\n and SO\n2\n emission reduction requirements, regulation of CO\n2 \nemissions, wastewater discharge standards, remediation efforts, and CCR management regulations, and a discussion of litigation against Ameren Missouri with respect to NSR, the Clean Air Act, and Missouri law in connection with projects at Ameren Missouri’s Rush Island Energy Center, see Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nTRANSMISSION\nAmeren owns an integrated transmission system that is composed of the transmission assets of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. Ameren also operates two MISO balancing authority areas: AMMO and AMIL. The AMMO balancing authority area includes the load and most energy centers of Ameren Missouri, and had a peak demand of 7,560 MWs in 2024. The AMIL balancing authority area includes the load of Ameren Illinois and certain Ameren Missouri energy centers located in Illinois, and had a peak demand of 8,479 MWs in 2024. The Ameren transmission system directly connects with 15 other balancing authority areas for the exchange of electric energy.\nAmeren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are transmission-owning members of the MISO. Ameren Missouri is authorized by the MoPSC to participate in the MISO for an indefinite term, subject to the MoPSC’s authority to require future proceedings if an event or circumstance occurs that significantly affects Ameren Missouri’s position in the MISO. Ameren Illinois’ election to participate in the MISO is subject to the ICC’s oversight.\nSUPPLY OF ELECTRIC POWER\nCapacity\nAmeren Missouri sells all of its capacity to the MISO and purchases the capacity it needs to supply its native load sales from the MISO. Ameren Illinois purchases capacity from the MISO and through bilateral contracts resulting from IPA procurement events. In 2022, the FERC issued an order approving changes to the annual MISO capacity auction. Historically, the auctions were designed to cover annual peak demand plus a target reserve margin. Beginning with the April 2023 auction for the June 2023 to May 2024 planning year, auctions include four seasonal load forecasts and available capacity levels and are designed to cover each season’s peak demand plus a target reserve margin. The seasonal auction structure was established to help to address variability in resources as the MISO begins to rely more heavily on renewable generation.\nAmeren Missouri\nAmeren Missouri’s electric supply is primarily generated from its energy centers. Factors that could cause Ameren Missouri to purchase power include, among other things, energy center outages, the fulfillment of renewable energy requirements, extreme weather conditions, the availability of power at a cost lower than its generation cost, and the lack of sufficient owned generation availability.\nAmeren Missouri files a long-term nonbinding preferred resource plan with the MoPSC every three years. The most recent preferred resource plan was filed in September 2023. Ameren Missouri expects to file a notice of change in its preferred resource plan with the MoPSC in February 2025 to address new load growth opportunities resulting from entities in various industries, including data center and manufacturing, that are considering either locating or expanding their operations within Ameren Missouri’s service territory. The 2025 Change to the 2023 PRP is expected to include, among other things, the following:\n10\nTable\n of Contents\n•\nadding 1,600 MWs of natural gas-fired simple-cycle generation by 2030, which includes the 800-MW Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project discussed in Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report, and an additional 1,200 MWs by 2043;\n•\nadding 2,100 MWs of natural gas-fired combined-cycle generation by 2035 and an additional 1,200 MWs by 2040;\n•\nadding 3,200 MWs of renewable generation by 2030, which includes the 900 MWs of solar generation projects discussed in Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report, and an additional 1,500 MWs by 2035;\n•\nadding 1,000 MWs of battery storage by 2030 and an additional 800 MWs by 2042;\n•\nadding 1,500 MWs of nuclear generation by 2040;\n•\nretiring all of Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers by 2042;\n•\nretiring 1,800 MWs of Ameren Missouri’s natural gas-fired energy centers by 2040 to comply with Illinois law;\n•\nthe continued implementation of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs; and\n•\nthe expectation that Ameren Missouri will seek and receive NRC approval for an extension of the operating license for the Callaway Energy Center beyond its current 2044 expiration date.\nThe addition of renewable, natural gas-fired, or nuclear generation facilities is subject to obtaining necessary project approvals, including FERC approval and the issuance of a CCN by the MoPSC, as applicable. Ameren Missouri would be adversely affected if the MoPSC does not allow recovery of the remaining investment and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of an energy center, as well as the ability to earn a return on that remaining investment and those decommissioning costs. The next preferred resource plan is required to be filed by October 2026.\nAmeren Missouri continues to evaluate its longer-term needs for new generating capacity. The need for investment in new sources of energy is dependent on several key factors, including continuation of and customer participation in energy-efficiency programs, the amount of distributed generation from customers, load growth, including demand from data centers, technological advancements, costs of generation alternatives, environmental regulation of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants, changes in United States energy policy and priorities under the current federal administration, and state renewable energy requirements, which could lead to the retirement of current baseload assets before the end of their current useful lives or alterations in the way those assets operate, which could result in increased capital expenditures and/or increased operations and maintenance expenses. Because of the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload energy center, Ameren Missouri continues to study alternatives and to take steps to preserve options to meet future demand. Steps include evaluating the potential for further diversification of Ameren Missouri’s generation portfolio through renewable energy generation, including wind and solar generation, natural gas-fired generation, including the potential to switch to hydrogen fuel and/or blend hydrogen fuel with natural gas and install carbon capture technology, extending the operating license for the Callaway Energy Center, additional customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs, distributed energy resources, and energy storage.\nMissouri law required Ameren Missouri to offer solar rebates through December 2023 and currently requires Ameren Missouri to offer net metering to certain customers that install renewable generation at their premises. The difference between the cost of the solar rebates and the amount set in base rates was deferred as a regulatory asset or liability under the RESRAM, and earns carrying costs at short-term interest rates. Customers that elect to enroll in net metering are allowed to net their generation against their distribution usage within each billing month.\nAmeren Illinois\nIn Illinois, while electric transmission and distribution service rates are regulated, power supply prices are not. Although electric customers are allowed to purchase power from an alternative retail electric supplier, Ameren Illinois is required to be the provider of last resort for its electric distribution customers. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, Ameren Illinois procured power on behalf of its customers for 25%, 28%, and 28%, respectively, of its total kilowatthour sales. Power purchased by Ameren Illinois for its electric distribution customers who do not elect to purchase their power from an alternative retail electric supplier comes either through procurement processes conducted by the IPA or through markets operated by the MISO. The IPA administers an RFP process through which Ameren Illinois procures its expected supply. The purchased power and related procurement costs incurred by Ameren Illinois are passed directly to its electric distribution customers through a cost recovery mechanism. Transmission costs are charged to customers who purchase electricity from Ameren Illinois through a cost recovery mechanism. The purchased power, power procurement, and transmission costs are reflected in Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution’s results of operations, but do not affect Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution’s earnings because these costs are offset by corresponding revenues. Ameren Illinois charges distribution service rates to electric distribution customers who purchase electricity, regardless of supplier, which does affect Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution’s earnings.\nPursuant to the CEJA, Ameren Illinois is required to file a Grid Plan with the ICC every four years. In December 2024, the ICC issued an order approving Ameren Illinois’ revised Grid Plan under its MYRP proceeding for electric distribution service for 2024 through 2027. For additional information regarding Ameren Illinois’ MYRP proceeding, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report. The Grid Plan outlines how Ameren Illinois expects to invest in electric distribution infrastructure in order to support grid modernization, clean energy, energy efficiency, and the state of Illinois’ renewable energy, equity, climate, electrification, and environmental \n11\nTable\n of Contents\ngoals. Ameren Illinois’ next Grid Plan is required to be filed by mid-January 2026.\nIllinois law requires Ameren Illinois to offer rebates and net metering to certain customers who install renewable generation or paired energy storage systems at their premises. The cost of the customer generation rebate program is deferred as a regulatory asset, which earns a return at the applicable WACC. Customers that elect to receive a generation rebate and are enrolled in net metering are allowed to net their power supply service charges, but not their distribution service charges. Customers that elect to receive energy storage rebates and have not received generation rebates are allowed to net their power supply and distribution service charges. By law, Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution revenues are decoupled from sales volumes, which ensures that the electric distribution revenues authorized in a regulatory rate review are not affected by changes in sales volumes.\nPOWER GENERATION\nAmeren Missouri owns energy centers that rely on a diverse fuel portfolio, including coal, nuclear, and natural gas, as well as renewable sources of generation. Both of Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers were constructed prior to 1978. As of December 31, 2024, Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers represented 6% and 11% of Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s rate base, respectively. The Callaway Energy Center began operation in 1984 and is licensed to operate until 2044. Ameren Illinois operates two solar generation facilities, which are two of three pilot solar projects Ameren Illinois is allowed to invest in under the CEJA. The third solar generation facility is planned to be placed in service before the end of 2026. See"
