    "item1": "Item 1\n. Business\n. Information regarding our cruise ships under construction, estimated expenditures and financing may be found within the\n Future Capital Commitments \nand \nFunding Needs and Sources\n sections of Item 7.\n Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nOur principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in leased office buildings at the Port of Miami, Florida. We also lease a number of other offices in the U.S. and throughout Europe, Asia, Mexico, South America and Australia to administer our brand operations globally.\nWe believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that we are capable of obtaining additional facilities as necessary. \nWe also operate two private destinations which we utilize as ports-of-call on certain itineraries: (i) an island we own in the Bahamas that we call CocoCay; and (ii) Labadee, a secluded peninsula that we lease on the north coast of Haiti.\n Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nAs previously reported, a lawsuit was filed against us in August 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the \"Court\") under Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act. The complaint filed by Havana Docks Corporation (\"Havana Docks Action\") alleges it holds an interest in the Havana Cruise Port Terminal, which was expropriated by the Cuban government. The complaint further alleges that we trafficked in the terminal by embarking and disembarking passengers at these facilities. The plaintiffs seek all available statutory remedies, including the value of the expropriated property, plus interest, treble damages, attorneys’ fees and costs.\nThe Court entered final judgment in December 2022 in favor of the plaintiff and awarded damages and attorneys' fees to the plaintiff in the aggregate amount of approximately $112 million. We then appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. On October 22, 2024, the 11th Circuit issued an opinion reversing the lower court’s judgment. The plaintiff's petition for a rehearing by the full 11th Circuit was subsequently denied. The plaintiff has the right to petition the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a charge of approximately $130 million to \nOther income (expense) \nwithin our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) related to the Havana Docks Action, including post-judgment interest and related legal defense costs and bonding fees. Following the 11th Circuit's denial of the rehearing petition, we released approximately $124 million of the previously recorded loss contingency for the year ended December 31, 2024, recognized within \nOther income (expense) \nwithin our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nIn addition, we are routinely involved in claims typical within the cruise vacation industry. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance. We believe the outcome of such claims, net of expected insurance recoveries, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNone.\n24\nPART II\n-Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"RCL.\"\nHolders\nAs of February 11, 2025, there were approximately 1,075 record holders of our common stock. Since certain of our shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, the foregoing number is not representative of the number of beneficial owners.\nDividends\nHolders of our common stock have an equal right, pro rata based on number of shares held, to share in our profits in the form of dividends when and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available, subject to any rights of holders of preferred stock if any. Holders of our common stock have no rights to any sinking fund. \nThere are no exchange control restrictions on remittances of dividends on our common stock by reason of our incorporation in Liberia because (1) we are and intend to maintain our status as a nonresident Liberian entity under the Liberia Revenue Code of 2000 as amended and the regulations thereunder, and (2) our ship-owning subsidiaries are not now engaged, and are not in the future expected to engage, in any business in Liberia, including voyages exclusively within the territorial waters of the Republic of Liberia. Under current Liberian law, no Liberian taxes or withholding will be imposed on payments to holders of our securities other than to a holder that is a resident Liberian entity or a resident individual or an individual or entity subject to taxation in Liberia as a result of having a permanent establishment within the meaning of the Liberia Revenue Code of 2000 as amended in Liberia. \nThe declaration of dividends shall at all times be subject to the final determination of our board of directors that a dividend is prudent at that time in consideration of the needs of the business. During the second quarter of 2024, we repaid the principal amounts deferred under our export credit facilities, which eliminated the restriction on dividends. In the second quarter of 2024, our Board of Directors reinstated our quarterly dividend. Since reinstatement, we have paid a dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock in October 2024, and a dividend of $\n0.55\n per share of common stock in January 2025. Refer to\n \nNote 10\n. Shareholders' Equity \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further information on dividends declared. \nIn February 2025, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $\n0.75\n per share, payable in April 2025.\nShare Repurchases\nThere were no repurchases of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. \nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we repaid the principal amounts deferred under our export credit facilities, which eliminated the restriction on share repurchases. Refer to Note 8\n. Debt\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further information on the transaction.\nIn February 2025, our board of directors authorized a 12-month common stock repurchase program for up to $1.0 billion. The timing and number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price and market conditions. Repurchases under the program may be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.\n25\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the total return, assuming reinvestment of dividends, on an investment in the Company, based on performance of the Company's common stock, with the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index (\"S&P 500\") and the Dow Jones United States Travel and Leisure Index for a five year period by measuring the changes in common stock prices from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2024.\n12/19\n12/20\n12/21\n12/22\n12/23\n12/24\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd\n. \n100.00\n56.61\n58.28\n37.46\n98.14\n175.65\nS&P 500\n100.00\n118.40\n152.39\n124.79\n157.59\n197.02\nDow Jones U.S. Travel & Leisure\n100.00\n101.74\n113.43\n90.45\n123.09\n143.76\nThe stock performance graph assumes for comparison that the value of the Company's common stock and of each index was $100 on December 31, 2019 and that all dividends were reinvested.

Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n of our \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 202\n3\n, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024 and is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\n28\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). (Refer to Note 1\n. General\n and Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n). Certain of our accounting policies are deemed \"critical,\" as they require management's highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. We have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. We believe our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows:\nShip Accounting\nShips represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 10%-15% projected residual value, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally 30-35 years. The 30-35 year useful life and 10%-15% residual value is the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. Our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, environmental regulations, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. We employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems. However, we estimate the costs, useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives, as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry. We do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems, but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements' estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized within \nCruise operating expenses \nin our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nWe periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships the planned level of improvements to maintain, enhance, and to comply with environmental regulations for vessels within those classes. In the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed. \nWe use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel's age as required by Class. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification. Class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. The activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. The significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast tanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. We perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain Class. The costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel's designed and intended operating capability. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred.\nWe use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs. If the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss on disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place. We also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred. \nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes. However, should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower. If circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship \n29\nimprovements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year, depreciation expense for 2024 would have increased by approximately $166 million. If our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for 2024 would have increased by approximately $452 million. We have evaluated our estimated ship useful lives and projected residual values in light of our current environment and determined that there are no changes to these estimates. Refer to Note 6\n. Property and Equipment\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n for further information on our ships\n.\nValuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, and if necessary, a goodwill impairment test. Factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nThe goodwill impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. We typically estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. The estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues, operating costs, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, interest rates, and assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry's competitive environment and general economic and business conditions, among other factors. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2024 impairment assessment consisted of:\n•\nForecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day;\n•\nOccupancy rates from existing vessels;\n•\nVessel operating expenses;\n•\nTerminal growth rate; and\n•\nWeighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).\nThe discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base. We discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weighted average cost of capital.\nIf the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no write-down of goodwill is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets, an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit. Refer to Note 4\n. Goodwill\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further information on goodwill.\nThe impairment review for indefinite-lived intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment. The quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these assets using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset, such as the relief-from-royalty method, for trademarks and trade names. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2024 impairment assessment consisted of:\n•\nForecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day;\n•\nOccupancy rates from existing vessels;\n•\nTerminal growth rate;\n•\nRoyalty rate; and\n•\nWeighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).\nIf the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired. Other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 5.\n Intangible Assets\n to \n30\nour consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further information on indefinite-life and finite-life intangible assets.\nWe review our ships and other long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on recent and projected cash flow performance and remaining useful lives, that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships. If estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value. Refer to Note 6\n. Property and Equipment \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further information on determination of fair value for long-lived assets. \nWe estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If active markets are not available, we base fair value on independent appraisals, sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk. Quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinite-life intangible assets. Accordingly, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite-life intangible asset using an expected present value technique.\nRoyal Caribbean Reporting Unit\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a qualitative analysis as part of our annual impairment review of the Royal Caribbean reporting unit. Based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the Royal Caribbean reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus, we did not proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit's fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative analysis as part of our annual impairment review of the Royal Caribbean reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the quantitative test, we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 100%, resulting in no impairment to Royal Caribbean's goodwill. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our Royal Caribbean reporting unit was $296 million.\nWe did not perform interim impairment evaluations of Royal Caribbean's goodwill during \n2024\n and 2023, as no triggering events were identified.\nSilversea Cruises Reporting Unit\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2023, we performed a quantitative analysis as part of our annual impairment review of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit. As of November 30, 2024, and November 30, 2023, the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit was determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the tests, we determined the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 63%, as of November 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill attributable to our Silversea Cruises reporting unit was $509 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2023, we performed our annual impairment reviews of the Silversea Cruises trade name. As a result of the quantitative tests, we determined that the fair value of the Silversea Cruises' trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 66% and 62%, as of November 30, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' tr\nade name. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and \n2023\n, the carrying value of indefinite-life intangible assets was $321 million, which primarily relates to the Silversea Cruises trade name. \nWe did not perform interim impairment evaluations of Silversea Cruises' goodwill or trade names during \n2024\n and 2023, as no triggering events were identified.\n31\nDerivative Instruments\nWe enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments. Although some of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance. Refer to Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n and Note 16.\n Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor more information on related authoritative guidance, the Company's hedging programs and derivative financial instruments.\nOn a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options with third-party institutions in over-the-counter markets. We estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments' contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We value floors which are embedded within our interest rate swaps using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options’ contract terms, such as exercise price and maturity, and readily available market data, such as forward interest rates and interest rate volatility. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments.\nWe estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps' contract terms and forward prices. We derive forward prices from published forward fuel curves which in turn are based on actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments. We also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties.\nWe adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk.\nWe believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions, inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience.\nContingencies—Litigation\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made. \nSeasonality\nOur revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises. Demand has historically been strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere's summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have historically focused on deployment to the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period. \nFinancial Presentation\nDescription of Certain Line Items\nRevenues\nOur revenues are comprised of the following:\n•\nPassenger ticket revenues\n, which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships; and\n32\n•\nOnboard and other revenues\n, which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and/or services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices, casino operations, cancellation fees, sales of vacation protection insurance, pre- and post-cruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities. \nOnboard and other revenues\n also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods and/or services onboard our ships, as well as revenues received for procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates.\nCruise Operating Expenses\nOur cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following:\n•\nCommissions, transportation and other expenses\n, which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues, including travel advisor commissions, air and other transportation expenses, port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees;\n•\nOnboard and other expenses\n, which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues, including the costs of products sold onboard our ships, vacation protection insurance premiums, costs associated with pre- and post-cruise tours and related credit card fees, as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues, as the costs are mostly incurred by third-party concessionaires and costs incurred for the procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates;\n•\nPayroll and related expenses\n, which consist of costs for shipboard personnel (costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in \nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses\n);\n•\nFood expenses\n, which include food costs for both guests and crew;\n•\nFuel expenses\n, which include fuel and related delivery, storage and emission consumable costs and the financial impact of fuel swap agreements; and\n•\nOther operating expenses\n, which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance, port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts, vessel related insurance, entertainment and gains and/or losses related to the sale of our ships, if any. \nWe do not allocate payroll and related expenses, food expenses, fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience.\nSelected Operational and Financial Metrics\nWe utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition. As discussed in more detail herein, certain of these metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided along with the related GAAP financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA (as defined below) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful whe\nn assessing our profitability on a comparative basis. For the p\neriods presented, these items included (i) Other (income) expense, which includes the 2024 release of the loss contingency recorded in 2022 in connection with the Havana Docks litigation inclusive of related legal fees and costs; (ii) impa\nirment and credit losses\n; (iii) \nequity investment impairment, recovery of losses and other;\n (iv) restru\ncturing charges and other initiatives expense; and (v) \ngain on sale of controlling interest\n. A reconciliation of \nNet Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations. \nAdjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share (\"Adjusted EPS\") \nis a non-GAAP measure that\n \nrepresents Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.\n33\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n represents Gross Margin, adjusted for payroll and related, food, fuel, other operating, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Gross Margin is calculated pursuant to GAAP as total revenues less total cruise operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n \nis a non-GAAP measure that \nrepresents net income (loss) less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included \n(i) loss on extinguishment of debt; (ii) litigation loss contingency, which includes the 2024 release of the loss contingency recorded in 2022 in connection with the Havana Docks litigation inclusive of related legal fees and costs; (iii) impairment and credit losses; (iv) equity investment impairment, recovery of losses and other; (v) restructuring charges and other initiatives expense; (vi) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the Silversea Cruises acquisition in 2018; (vii) tax on the sale of PortMiami noncontrolling interest; (viii) \nSilver Whisper\n deferred tax liability release; and (ix) gain on sale of controlling interest. A reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) \nattributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. \nto Adjusted Net Income (Loss) \nattributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. \nis provided below under Results of Operations.\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss)\n is a non-GAAP measure that represents operating income (loss) including income (loss) from equity investments and income taxes but excluding (i) impairment and credit losses; (ii) equity investment impairment, recovery of losses and other; (iii) restructuring charges and other initiatives expense; (iv) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the Silversea Cruises acquisition in 2018; and (v) tax on the sale of PortMiami noncontrolling interest. We use this non-GAAP measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below). A reconciliation of Operating Income to Adjusted Operating \nIncome \nis provided below under Results of Operations.\nAvailable Passenger Cruise Days\n (\"\nAPCD\n\") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary.\nConstant Currency\n is a significant measure for our revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, the value of these revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollar will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses, it can be an important element. For this reason, we also monitor our revenues and expenses in \"Constant Currency\" - i.e., as if the current period's currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior perio\nd's rates. For the 2024 period presented, w\ne calculate \"Constant Currency\" by applying the average for 2023 period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months, so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods. We do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods. It should be emphasized that the use of Constant Currency is primarily used by us for comparing short-term changes and/or projections. Over the longer term, changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency-based fluctuations.\nEBITDA \nis a non-GAAP measure that represents Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax benefit or expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. A reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations.\nGross Cruise Costs \nrepresent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses.\nGross Margin Yield \nrepresent Gross Margin per APCD.\nInvested Capital\n represents the most recent five-quarter average of total debt (i.e., Current portion of long-term debt plus Long-term debt) plus the most recent five-quarter average of Total shareholders' equity. We use this measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below).\nNet Cruise Costs \nand \nNet C\nruise Costs \nexcluding\n Fuel\n are non-GAAP measures that represent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses, onboard and other expenses and, in the case of Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel, fuel expenses (each of which is described above under the Description of Certain Line Items heading). In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our cost performance. For the periods presented, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel excludes (i) impairment and credit losses; (ii) restructuring charges and other \n34\ninitiatives expense; and (iii) the gain on sale of controlling interests. \nA reconciliation of Gross Cruise Costs to Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel is provided below under Results of Operations.\nNet Yields\n represent Adjusted Gross Margin per APCD. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin and Net Yields to manage our business on a day-to-day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs, which are commissions, transportation and other expenses, and onboard and other expenses.\nOccupancy (\"Load factor\")\n, in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days (as defined below) by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.\nPassenger Cruise Days (\"PCD\")\n represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.\nReturn on Invested Capital\n (\"ROIC\") represents Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) divided by Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.\nTrifecta\n refers to the multi-year Adjusted EBITDA per APCD, Adjusted EPS and ROIC goals we publicly announced in November 2022. We designed these goals to help us better execute and achieve our business goals by clearly articulating longer-term financial objectives. Under Trifecta, we are targeting Adjusted EBITDA per APCD of at least $100, Adjusted EPS of at least $10, and ROIC of 13% or higher by the end of 2025. On July 25, 2024, we announced the company achieved all three of its Trifecta goals 18 months ahead of schedule, on a trailing twelve-month basis.\nThe use of certain significant non-GAAP measures, such as Net Yields, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel, allows us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard GAAP based financial measures. There are no specific rules or regulations for determining non-GAAP measures, and as such, they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry. \n35\nExecutive Overview\n2024 performance was exceptionally strong and significantly exceeded our expectations. \nWe took delivery of two new ships (\nUtopia of the Seas\n and \nSilver Ray\n), announced the expansion of our private destination portfolio with Royal Beach Club Cozumel and Perfect Day Mexico, and reinstated a dividend to our shareholders. We achieved strong financial performance, including 23.8% Gross Margin Yield growth as-reported, Net Yields increased 11.5% as-reported (11.6% in Constant-Currency), Net Income of $2.9 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $6.0 billion, Operating Income of 4.1 billion, and ROIC of 16.1%. As announced on July 25, 2024, we also achieved our Trifecta goals 18 months ahead of schedule. In addition, we made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet, refinancing approximately $6.1 billion of high cost debt, eliminating restrictions on our ability to return capital to shareholders, and eliminating all security and guarantees. \nOur 2024 Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was $2.9 billion, or $10.94 per diluted share, compared to Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $1.7 billion, or $6.31 per diluted share in 2023. Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for 2024 was $3.2 billion, or $11.80 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $1.8 billion, or $6.77 per diluted share in 2023.\nTotal revenues in 2024 were $16.5 billion compared to $13.9 billion in 2023 driven by strong ticket revenue and onboard revenue performance, inclusive of capacity growth. As a result of this, Gross Margin Yields increased 23.8% as-reported, and Net Yields increased 11.5% as-reported (11.6% in Constant-Currency), both compared to 2023. The strength in revenue and improved cash flow, combined with our margin expansion efforts allowed us to accelerate debt repayment, improving our debt maturity profile and strengthening our balance sheet.\nCruise operating expenses increased from $7.8 billion in 2023 to $8.7 billion in 2024. Gross Cruise Costs per APCD increased 4.6% as-reported and 4.6% in Constant Currency, compared to 2023. Net Cruise Costs, excluding Fuel, per APCD increased 6.8% as-reported and 6.8% in Constant Currency, compared to 2023, primarily driven by a record 22 ships in drydock in 2024, as well as higher incentive based, non-cash compensation expense.\nIn 2025, we expect our capacity to increase by 5.4% compared to 2024, with the addition of\n Star of the Seas\n in late summer and \nCelebrity Xcel\n in late 2025, and a full year of operations for \nUtopia of the Seas\n and\n Silver Ray\n. In addition, the first Royal Beach Club, at Paradise Island in the Bahamas, is set to open towards the end of the year, and \nWonder of the Seas\n will join \nUtopia of the Seas\n focused on short Caribbean itineraries. We also expect to advance development of the Royal Beach Club Cozumel, Perfect Day Mexico, and Silversea’s new hotel in Puerto Williams, Chile that will provide a further-elevated and seamless guest experience for its Antarctica expeditions. Our new ships, optimized deployment, continued load factor growth and enhanced onboard offerings are expected to drive growth in Net Yields and Total Revenues.\n36\nResults of Operations\nIn addition to the items discussed above under \"Executive Overview,\" significant items for 2024 include:\n•\nNet Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion, or $10.94 and $11.80 per share on a diluted basis, respectively, compared to Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, or $6.31 and $6.77 per share on a diluted basis, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n•\nTotal revenues increased by $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.

Capacity was up 7.8% in 2024, driven by the additions of our newest ships \nUtopia of the Seas,\n \nIcon of the Seas,\n \nSilver Ray, \nas well as a full year of operations from \nCelebrity Ascent \nand \nSilver Nova.\nPassenger ticket revenues\n comprised 69.8% of our 2024 total revenues. \nPassenger ticket revenues \nincreased\n \nby $1.9 billion, or 20.2% to $11.5 billion in 2024 from $9.6 billion in 2023. \nThe increase was primarily due to:\n•\na 7.8% increase in capacity due to the new ships noted above, an increase in ticket prices on a per passenger basis, and a \n2.9%\n increase in occupancy.\n•\na $1.2 billion\n increase driven by higher ticket prices and occupancy in 2024, and\n a $0.7 billion increase driven by capacity.\nThe remaining 30.2% of total revenues was comprised of \nOnboard and other revenues\n, which increased $0.7 billion, or 15.1% to $5.0 billion in 2024 from $4.3 billion in 2023. The increase was due to:\n•\na $336 million increase driven by a 7.8% increase in capacity due to the additions of new ships noted above in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n•\na $318 million increase driven by improved pricing and an increase in occupancy of 2.9% in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nCruise operating expenses \nTotal \nCruise operating expenses\n increased by $0.9 billion, or 11.3%, to $8.7 billion in 2024 from $7.8 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to:\n•\nthe 7.8% increase in capacity noted above which increased cruise operating expenses by $603 million; and \n•\nan increase of $300 million driven by various factors including an increase in higher drydock and maintenance related expenses; and commissions due to the increases in ticket prices noted above in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses\n increased $333 million, or 18.6% to $2.1 billion in 2024 from $1.8 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense driven by an increase in headcount and higher stock price related to our performance share awards in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, and higher spending on advertisement and media promotions.\nOther income (expense)\nInterest expense, net of interest capitalized \nfor 2024\n \nincreased\n \n$188 million, to $(1.6) billion from $(1.4) billion in 2023. The increase was due to loss on extinguishment of debt of $344 million primarily associated with the full redemption of our 11.625%, 9.250%, 8.250%, and 7.25% Senior Notes, and $119 million inducement expense on the partial settlement of our 2025 Convertible notes in 2024 compared to loss on extinguishment of debt of $121 million during the same period in 2023. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $146 million lower interest expense in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, resulting from the 2024 refinancings.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses \nfor 2024 increased $145 million, or 10.0%, to $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to the additions of \nIcon of the Seas, Utopia of the Seas,\n and \nSilver Ray \ncompared to the addition of \nCelebrity Ascent \nand\n Silver Nova \nduring\n \nthe second half of 2023.\nEquity investment income\n for 2024 was $260 million compared to $200 million in 2023. The increase in income was primarily due to income from TUI Cruises, one of our equity method investments, in 2024 compared to 2023.\n44\nOther income (expense)\n increased $111 million, to other income in 2024, from other expense of $(8) million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to the release of the loss contingency of \n$124 million\n recorded in 2022 in connection with the Havana Docks litigation.\n45\nFuture Application of Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n for further information on \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\n \nNet cash provided by operating activities \nincreased by $0.8 billion to $5.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to cash provided of $4.5 billion for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nNet cash used in investing activities \ndecreased by\n \n$0.5 billion to $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to cash used of $3.9 billion for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $0.5 billion was primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures associated with taking delivery of \nIcon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent, and\n \nSilver Nova \nin 2023 compared to \nUtopia of the Seas \nand\n Silver Ray \nin 2024.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities \nwas $(1.9) billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to cash used of $(2.0) billion for the same period in 2023. The change of $0.1 billion was primarily attributable to an increase in debt repayments of $2.1 billion, an increase in premiums on repayments of debt of $0.2 billion, an increase of $0.1 billion related to our return to payment of dividends in 2024, and proceeds of $0.2 billion for the sale of noncontrolling interest of PortMiami, which did not recur in 2024. The change was offset by an increase of $2.7 billion related to debt proceeds in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. \nFuture Capital Commitments\nCapital Expenditures\nOur future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. As of December 31, 2024, we have two Icon-class ships and one Oasis-class ship on order for our Royal Caribbean brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,900 berths. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we have one Edge-class ship on order for our Celebrity Cruises brand, with a capacity of approximately 3,250 berths. Refer to Item 1. \nBusiness-Operations\n for further information on our ships on order. We have committed financing arrangements in place covering approximately 80% of the cost of the ship for the four ships on order for our Global Brands, all of which include sovereign financing guarantees.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, excluding any ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately $7.8 billion, of which we had deposited $815 million. Approximately 43.4% of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 16.\n Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments \nand Note 17.\n Commitments and Contingencies\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we anticipate overall full year capital expenditures, based on our existing ships on order, will be approximately $5 billion for 2025. This amount does not include any ships on order by our Partner Brands.\n46\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2024, our material cash requirements were as follows (in millions): \n \nPayments due by period\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\nOperating Activities:\n \n \n \n \n \nInterest on debt\n(1)\n$\n954 \n$\n890 \n$\n753 \n$\n581 \n$\n477 \n$\n1,630 \n$\n5,285 \nOther\n(2)\n178 \n188 \n167 \n124 \n118 \n797 \n1,572 \nInvesting Activities:\nShip purchase obligations\n(3)\n2,421 \n1,689 \n141 \n1,427 \n— \n— \n5,678 \nTotal\n$\n3,553 \n$\n2,767 \n$\n1,061 \n$\n2,132 \n$\n595 \n$\n2,427 \n$\n12,535 \n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)    Long-term debt obligations mature at various dates through fiscal year 2037 and bear interest at fixed and variable rates. Interest on variable-rate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt balances, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, using the applicable rate at December 31, 2024. Debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at December 31, 2024.\n(2)    Amounts primarily represent future commitments with remaining terms in excess of one year to pay for our usage of certain port facilities, marine consumables, services and maintenance contracts.\n(3)     Amounts are based on contractual installment and delivery dates for our ships on order. Included in these figures are $4.9 billion in final contractual installments, which have committed financing covering approximately 80% of the cost of the ships on order for our Global Brands, all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. Amounts do not include potential obligations which remain subject to cancellation at our sole discretion or any agreements entered for ships on order that remain contingent upon completion of conditions precedent.\nRefer to Note 8\n. Debt \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor maturities related to debt.\nRefer to Note 9\n. Leases \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor maturities related to lease liabilities.\nRefer to \nFunding Needs and Sources\n below for discussion on the planned funding of the above material contractual obligations. \nAs a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, pricing and our overall growth strategy, we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships. We continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these were to occur, they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n.\nRefer to Note 8\n. Debt \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor export credit agency guarantees.\nRefer to Note 7.\n Investments and Other Assets \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor ownership restrictions related to TUI Cruises.\nRefer to Note 17.\n Commitments and Contingencies \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor other agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2024, other than the items described above, we are not party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities, that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial position.\n47\nFunding Needs and Sources\nWe have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $5.9 billion of committed financing for our ships on order. As of December 31, 2024, our obligations due through December 31, 2025 primarily consisted of $1.6 billion related to debt maturities, $1.0 billion related to interest on debt and $2.4 billion related to progress payments on our ship orders and, based on expected delivery date, the final installments payable due upon the delivery of \nStar\n \nof the Seas \nand \nCelebrity Xcel\n. We have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, draw-downs under our available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional debt and/or the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund our obligations. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had liquidity of $4.1 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $0.4 billion and $3.7 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity. Refer to Note 8\n. Debt \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further information.\nIf any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms. Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. If this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations.\nBased on our assumptions and estimates and our financial condition, we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. However, there is no assurance that our assumptions and estimates are accurate as there is inherent uncertainty in our ability to predict future liquidity requirements. \nDebt Covenants\nOur export credit facilities and our non-export credit facilities, and certain of our credit card processing agreements contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio, limit our net debt-to-capital ratio, and to maintain a minimum liquidity. In July 2024, we amended all of our export credit facilities to eliminate the contractual requirement for us to maintain a minimum level of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants and we estimate that we will be in compliance for at least the next twelve months. \nDividends\nThe declaration of dividends shall at all times be subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors that a dividend is prudent at that time in consideration of the needs of the business. In December 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.55 per share, which was paid in January 2025. During the third quarter of 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share, which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn February 2025, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.75 per share, payable in April 2025.\n48\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nFinancial Instruments and Other\nGeneral\nWe are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices, and carbon emission allowances. We try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies. The financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the amount, term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged. Although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Refer to Note 16.\n Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nInterest Rate Risk \nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our debt obligations including future interest payments. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 92.3% and 83.2%, respectively, of our debt was effectively fixed-rate debt, which is net of our interest rate swap agreements. We use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense.\nThe estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2024 was $18.4 billion, using quoted market prices, where available, or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile. A hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2024 would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged fixed-rate debt by approximately $701 million.\nMarket risk associated with our floating-rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates. We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis to manage this risk. A hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2025 interest expense by approximately $14.8 million, assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates. \nAt December 31, 2024, we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floating-rate debt instruments:\nDebt Instrument\nSwap Notional as of December 31, 2024 (In millions)\nMaturity\nDebt Floating Rate\nSpread\nAll-in Fixed Rate\nQuantum of the Seas\n term loan\n123 \nOctober 2026\nTerm SOFR plus\n1.30%\n3.78%\nAnthem of the Seas\n term loan\n151 \nApril 2027\nTerm SOFR plus\n1.30%\n3.9%\nOvation of the Seas\n term loan \n242 \nApril 2028\nTerm SOFR plus\n1.00%\n3.2%\nHarmony of the Seas\n term loan \n(1)\n209 \nMay 2028\nEURIBOR plus\n1.15%\n2.26%\nOdyssey of the Seas \nterm loan\n(2)\n307 \nOctober 2032\nTerm SOFR plus\n0.96%\n3.28%\nOdyssey of the Seas\n term loan \n(2)\n153 \nOctober 2032\nTerm SOFR plus\n0.96%\n2.91%\n$\n1,185 \n___________________________________________________________________\n(1)    \nInterest rate swap agreements hedging the Euro-denominated term loan for \nHarmony of the Seas\n include EURIBOR zero-floors matching the hedged debt EURIBOR zero-floor. Amount presented is based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2024.\n(2)    Interest rate swap agreements hedging the term loan of \nOdyssey of the Seas\n include Term SOFR zero-floors, Term SOFR with no floors, and Overnight SOFR.\nThese interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\nThe fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of $64 million as of December 31, 2024 based on the present value of expected future cash flows. These interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n49\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nOur primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in Euros, our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations. On a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. \nThe estimated fair value, as of December 31, 2024, of our Euro-denominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of $92 million, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, not including ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately $7.8 billion, of which we had deposited $815 million as of such date. Approximately 43.4% and 43.5% of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the Euro as of December 31, 2024, assuming no changes in comparative interest rates, would result in a $337 million increase in the United States dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate. Our foreign currency forward contract agreements are accounted for as cash flow or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge.\nOur international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk. We transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows. We manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis, which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets. Therefore, weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time. The extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time. In addition, some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available. \nWe consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a long-term nature. We address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries' and investments' functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments. We had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of approximately €889 million, or approximately $921 million, through December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of approximately €648 million, or approximately $716 million.\nWe have included net gains of approximately $96 million and $41 million of foreign-currency transaction remeasurement and changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOn a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. During 2024, we maintained an average of approximately $1.1 billion of these foreign currency forward contracts. These instruments are not designated as hedging instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in (losses) gain of approximately $(77) million, $19 million and $(102) million, respectively, which offset gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of $65 million, $(43) million and $93 million, respectively. These changes were recognized in earnings within \nOther income (expense) \nin our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nFuel Price Risk \nOur exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships. Fuel cost, net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements, as a percentage of our total revenues, was approximately 7.0% in 2024, 8.3% in 2023 and 12.1% in 2022. We use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $1.0 billion, maturing through 2027. These fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fuel swap agreements designated as hedges of projected fuel purchases represented 60% of our projected 2025 fuel requirements. The estimated fair value of our fuel swap agreements at December 31, 2024 was estimated to be a liability of $33 million. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% increase in our weighted-average fuel price from that experienced during the year ended December 31, 2024 would increase our forecasted 2025 fuel cost by approximately $60 million, net of the impact of fuel swap agreements.\n50\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are included beginning on page F-1 of this report.\nItem 9. Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\n51\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that those controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (the \"SEC\").\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the \nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as stated in its report, which is included herein on page F-2.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, \nnone of our directors or executive officers adopted, modified or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement”\n (as such term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).\nItem 9C.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2022, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible notes.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nF-2\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nImpairment Assessments – Silversea Cruises Reporting Unit Goodwill and Trade Name\nAs described in Notes 2, 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2024 the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $808 million and the goodwill associated with the Silversea Cruises reporting unit was $509 million. The Company’s consolidated indefinite-life intangible assets balance was $321 million which primarily relates to the Silversea Cruises trade name of $319 million. Management reviews goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The quantitative impairment assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit or asset with its carrying value. Fair value is estimated by management using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach for reporting units and a relief-from-royalty method for trade names. Management’s principal assumptions for the impairment assessments consisted of forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day, occupancy rates from existing vessels, vessel operating expenses, terminal growth rate, royalty rate, and weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate). \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessments of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit goodwill and trade name is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit and trade name; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day, occupancy rates from existing vessels, terminal growth rates, and discount rates for the goodwill and trade name impairment assessments, vessel operating expenses for the goodwill impairment assessment and the royalty rate for the trade name impairment assessment; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill and trade name impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit and trade name. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the probability weighted discounted cash flow model and relief-from-royalty method used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the probability weighted discounted cash flow model and relief-from-royalty method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day, occupancy rates from existing vessels, terminal growth rates, and discount rates for the goodwill and trade name impairment assessments, vessel operating expenses for the goodwill impairment assessment, and the royalty rate for the trade name impairment assessment. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day, occupancy rates from existing vessels, vessel operating expenses and terminal growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit and the Silversea Cruises brand; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the probability weighted discounted cash flow model and relief-from-royalty method and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate and royalty rate assumptions.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nMiami, Florida\n \nFebruary 14, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1989, which includes periods before the Company became subject to SEC reporting requirements.

integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1\n. General\nDescription of Business\nWe are a global cruise company. We own and operate \nthree\n global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises (collectively, our \"Global Brands\"). We also own a \n50\n% joint venture interest in TUI Cruises GmbH (\"TUIC\"), which operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\"). We account for our investments in our Partner Brands under the equity method of accounting. Together, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands operated a combined fleet of \n68\n ships as of December 31, 2024. Our ships offer a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on more than \n1,000\n destinations in over \n120\n countries on all \nseven\n continents.\nBasis for Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements \nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Estimates are required for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with these principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n for a discussion of our significant accounting policies. The Company has changed its presentation from thousands to millions and, as a result, any necessary rounding adjustments have been made to prior period disclosed amounts.\nAll significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. We consolidate entities over which we have control, usually evidenced by a direct ownership interest of greater than 50%, and variable interest entities where we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 7.\n Investments and Other Assets\n for further information regarding our variable interest entities. For affiliates we do not control but over which we have significant influence on financial and operating policies, usually evidenced by a direct ownership interest from 20% to 50%, the investment is accounted for using the equity method.\n \nNote 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenues and Expenses\nDeposits received on sales of passenger cruises are initially recorded as customer deposit liabilities on our balance sheet. Customer deposits are subsequently recognized as passenger ticket revenues, together with revenues from onboard and other goods and services and all associated cruise operating expenses of a voyage.\n For further information on revenue recognition, refer to Note 3\n. Revenue\n. \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and marketable securities with original maturities of less than 90 days.\nInventories\nInventories consist of provisions, supplies and fuel carried at the lower of cost (weighted-average) or net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship, the useful lives of the improvements are estimated and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements' estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship, and the replaced assets are disposed of on a net cost basis. In addition, we capitalize interest on borrowings during the active construction period of capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the assets and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in \nCruise operating expenses\n. Liquidated damages received from shipyards as a result of the late delivery of a new ship are recorded as reductions to the cost basis of the ship. \nDepreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The useful lives of our ships are generally \n30\n-\n35\n years, net of a \n10\n%-\n15\n% projected residual value. The \n30\n-\n35\n-year useful \nF-9\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nlife and \n10\n%-\n15\n% residual value are based on the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. Our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, environmental regulations, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. We employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. Depreciation for assets under finance leases is computed using the shorter of the lease term or related asset life, unless the asset is a finance lease due to title transferring or a purchase option that is reasonably certain of being exercised, in which case the asset is depreciated over the related asset life.\nDepreciation of property and equipment is computed utilizing the following useful lives:\nYears\nShips\ngenerally, \n30\n-\n35\nShip improvements\n3\n-\n25\nBuildings and improvements\n10\n-\n40\nComputer hardware and software\n3\n-\n10\nTransportation equipment and other\n3\n-\n30\nLeasehold improvements\nShorter of remaining lease term or useful life \n3\n-\n30\nWe periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes. In the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed. \nWe review long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows, that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships. If estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value. \nWe use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of \nthirty\n to \nsixty months\n based on the vessel's age as required by Class. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification. Class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. The activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. The significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast tanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. We perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain Class. The costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel's designed and intended operating capability. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. We review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors, including the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of \nF-10\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nthe reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, macroeconomic conditions, market conditions and our operating performance. \nIf we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which may also include a combination of a market-based valuation approach. The estimation of fair value utilizing a probability weighted discounted cash flow model includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues, operating costs, interest rates, ship additions and retirements as well as regarding the cruise vacation industry's competitive environment and general economic and business conditions. The principal assumptions used in the probability weighted discounted cash flow model for our 2024 impairment assessment consisted of: (i) forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day, (ii) occupancy rates from existing vessels, (iii) vessel operating expenses, (iv) terminal growth rate, and (v) weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate). The probability weighted discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base. We discount the probability weighted projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weighted-average cost of capital. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no write-down of goodwill is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets, an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit.\nIntangible Assets\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have acquired certain intangible assets to which value has been assigned based on our estimates. Intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test, or when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for indefinite-life intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment. The quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these assets using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset, such as the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks and trade names. The principal assumptions used in the probability weighted discounted cash flow model for our 2024 impairment assessment consisted of: (i) forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day, (ii) occupancy rates from existing vessels, (iii) terminal growth rate; (iv) royalty rate; and (v) weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate). If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired.\nOther intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nContingencies — Litigation\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable. We accrue a liability, including legal costs, when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred except those costs which result in tangible assets, such as brochures, which are treated as prepaid expenses and charged to expense as consumed. Advertising costs consist of media and online advertising as well as brochure, production and direct mail costs.\n \nTotal advertising costs inclusive of media, online advertising, brochure, production and direct mail costs were $\n612\n million, $\n506\n million and $\n509\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments. Although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not \nF-11\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nqualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, a derivative instrument that hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or a recognized asset or liability is designated as a fair value hedge. A derivative instrument that hedges a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are offset against changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments. Gains and losses on derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings. The foreign currency transaction gain or loss of our non-derivative financial instruments and the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of our net investment in foreign operations and investments are recognized as a component of \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss \nalong with the associated foreign currency translation adjustment of the foreign operation or investment. In certain hedges of our net investment in foreign operations and investments, we exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize the related amounts directly into earnings.\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess whether derivatives used in hedging transactions are \"highly effective\" in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of hedged items. For our net investment hedges, we use the dollar offset method to measure effectiveness. For all other hedging programs, we use the long-haul method to assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis for each hedge relationship. The methodology for assessing hedge effectiveness is applied on a consistent basis for each one of our hedging programs (i.e., interest rate, foreign currency ship construction, foreign currency net investment and fuel). For our regression analyses, we use an observation period of up to \nthree years\n, utilizing market data relevant to the hedge horizon of each hedge relationship. High effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the changes in the fair values of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or hedge accounting is discontinued, any change in fair value of the derivative since the last date at which it was determined to be effective is recognized in earnings. \nWe consider the classification of the underlying hedged item’s cash flows in determining the classification for the designated derivative instrument’s cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows from derivative instruments that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged items in our consolidated statements of cash flows. For example, we classify derivative instrument cash flows from hedges of benchmark interest rate or hedges of fuel expense as operating activities due to the nature of the hedged item. Likewise, we classify derivative instrument cash flows from hedges of foreign currency risk on our newbuild ship payments as investing activities. In the event that hedge accounting is discontinued, cash flows subsequent to the date of discontinuance are classified within investing activities. Cash flows from derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are classified as investing activities.\nForeign Currency Translations and Transactions\nWe translate assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency, at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. We translate revenues and expenses at weighted-average exchange rates for the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n, which is reflected as a separate component of \nShareholders' equity\n. Exchange gains or losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are immediately included in our earnings, except for certain liabilities that have been designated to act as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation or investment. The majority of our transactions are settled in United States dollars. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in other currencies are recognized in income at each balance sheet date.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nWe monitor our credit risk associated with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business and, to minimize these risks, we select counterparties with credit risks acceptable to us and we seek to limit our exposure to an individual counterparty. Credit risk, including but not limited to counterparty nonperformance under derivative instruments, our credit facilities and new ship progress payment guarantees, is not considered significant, as we primarily conduct business with large, well-established financial institutions, insurance companies and export credit agencies, many of which we have long-term relationships with and which have credit risks acceptable to us or where the credit risk is spread out among a large number of \nF-12\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ncounterparties. We do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our significant counterparties. In addition, we have established guidelines we follow regarding credit ratings and instrument maturities to maintain safety and liquidity. We do not normally require collateral or other security to support credit relationships; however, in certain circumstances this option is available to us.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nBasic Earnings (Loss) per share is computed by dividing \nNet Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted Earnings (Loss) per share incorporates the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed conversion of potentially dilutive securities. Effective January 1, 2022, we use the if-converted method to calculate the impact of our convertible notes that may be settled in cash or shares. To the extent dilutive, shares related to our convertible notes are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, and we add back the interest expense to the numerator. If we have a net loss for the period, all potentially dilutive securities will be considered antidilutive, resulting in the same basic and diluted net loss per share amounts for those periods.\nStock-Based Employee Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense at the estimated fair value of employee stock awards. Compensation expense for awards and the related tax effects are recognized as they vest. We use the estimated amount of expected forfeitures to calculate compensation costs for all outstanding awards.\nSegment Reporting\nWe believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of these brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by these brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics, types of consumers, regulatory environment, maintenance requirements, supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided. Our Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker (\"CODM\"), and is responsible for carrying out the functions of allocating resources and assessing performance. The CODM uses Operating Income (loss) to assess performance and allocate resources. This financial metric is used by the CODM to review operating trends and to monitor budget-to-actual variances in order to make key operating decisions.\n \nAdoption of Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update \n(\"ASU\") No. 2020-06\n, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (\"ASU 2020-06\"), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments. The guidance removes certain accounting models which separate the embedded conversion features from the host contract for convertible instruments, requiring bifurcation only if the convertible debt feature qualifies as a derivative under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\") or for convertible debt issued at a substantial premium. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, permitting more contracts to qualify for it. In addition, the guidance eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The guidance also decreases interest expense due to the reversal of the remaining non-cash convertible debt discount. On January 1, 2022 we adopted this pronouncement using the modified retrospective approach to recognize our convertible notes as single liability instruments given they do not qualify as derivatives under ASC 815, nor were they issued at a substantial premium. Accordingly, as of January 1, 2022, we recorded a $\n161\n million increase to debt, primarily as a result of the reversal of the remaining non-cash convertible debt discount, as well as a reduction of $\n307.6\n million to additional paid in capital, which resulted in a cumulative effect on adoption of approximately $\n146.2\n million to increase retained earnings.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and other segment items and requires companies to disclose all annual disclosures about segments in interim periods. This ASU also requires public entities with a single reportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this ASU and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of \nF-13\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nincremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We adopted the new guidance effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements or disclosures given our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) already includes disclosure of our significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to our chief operating decision-maker.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-04, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments. This ASU is intended to improve the relevance and consistency in application of the induced conversion guidance by clarifying the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion rather than a debt extinguishment. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for entities that have adopted the amendments in Update 2020-06 and the amendments can be applied on either a prospective or a retrospective basis. We early adopted the new guidance effective October 1, 2024 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-05, Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement. This ASU provides guidance requiring a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. The guidance is intended to provide users of joint venture financial statements with more decision-useful information. This ASU is effective for joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted, and joint ventures formed prior to the adoption date may elect to apply the new guidance retrospectively back to their original formation date. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The new guidance is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis. Early adoption and retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires disclosures about certain categories of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization) that are included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement, as well as disclosures about selling expenses. This new guidance is intended to provide investors with more detailed expense information in order to better understand an entity's cost structure and forecast future cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027 on a prospective basis. Early adoption and retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNote 3\n. Revenue\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are measured based on consideration specified in our contracts with customers and are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from passenger cruise contracts which are reported within \nPassenger ticket revenues\n in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Our performance obligation under these contracts is to provide a cruise vacation in exchange for the ticket price. We receive payment before we satisfy this performance obligation and recognize revenue over the duration of each cruise, which generally ranges from \nthree\n to \n14\n nights.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nPassenger ticket revenues\n include charges to our guests for port costs that vary with passenger head counts. These types of port costs, along with port costs that do not vary by passenger head counts, are included in our operating expenses. The amounts of port costs charged to our guests and included within \nPassenger ticket revenues\n on a gross basis were $\n1.1\n billion, $\n896\n million and $\n639\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur total revenues also include \nOnboard and other revenues\n, which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and services onboard our ships that are not included in passenger ticket prices. We receive payment before or concurrently with the transfer of these goods and services to cruise passengers and recognize revenue over the duration of the related cruise.\nAs a practical expedient, we have omitted disclosures on our remaining performance obligations as the duration of our contracts with customers is less than a year.\nDisaggregated Revenues\nThe following table disaggregates our total revenues by geographic regions where we provide cruise itineraries (in millions): \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues by itinerary\nNorth America(1)\n$\n10,594\n \n$\n8,707\n \n$\n5,716\n \nAsia/Pacific\n1,380\n \n993\n \n372\n \nEurope\n2,697\n \n2,685\n \n1,754\n \nOther Regions(2)\n1,025\n \n847\n \n540\n \nTotal revenues by itinerary\n15,696\n \n13,232\n \n8,382\n \nOther revenues(3)\n788\n \n668\n \n458\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n16,484\n \n$\n13,900\n \n$\n8,840\n \n(1)\n \nIncludes the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\n(2)\n \nIncludes seasonality impacted itineraries primarily in South American countries and Antarctica.\n(3)\n \nIncludes revenues primarily related to cancellation fees, vacation protection insurance, pre- and post-cruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities. Amounts also include revenues related to procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates. Refer to Note 7.\n Investments and Other Assets\n for more information on our unconsolidated affiliates.\nPassenger ticket revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on where the reservation originates. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our guests were sourced from the following areas:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPassenger ticket revenues:\nUnited States\n75\n \n%\n74\n \n%\n75\n \n%\nAll other countries (1)\n25\n \n%\n26\n \n%\n25\n \n%\n(1)\n \nNo other individual country's revenue exceeded 10% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nCustomer Deposits and Contract Liabilities\nOur payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to the cruise. Deposits received on sales of passenger cruises are initially recorded as \nCustomer deposits\n in our consolidated balance sheets and subsequently recognized as passenger ticket revenues or onboard revenues during the duration of the cruise. ASC 606, \nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\n, defines a “contract liability” as an entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration from the customer. We do not consider customer deposits to be a contract liability until the customer no longer retains the unilateral right, resulting from the passage of time, to cancel such customer's reservation and receive a full refund. \nCustomer deposits\n presented in our consolidated balance sheets include contract liabilities of $\n2.8\n billion and $\n2.6\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2024, our customer deposit balance includes $\n222\n million of unredeemed future cruise credits (\"FCCs\"), which were mostly held by guests with bookings on sailings that were cancelled during our suspension of global cruise operations. Our FCCs are not refundable and do not have expiration dates. Based upon our analysis of historical redemption experience, we believe a portion of our FCCs are not probable of being used in future periods. Based on our current estimates, we recognized an immaterial amount of FCC breakage revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024. We will continue to monitor changes in redemption behavior and estimate and record revenue associated with breakage when the likelihood of the customer exercising their remaining rights becomes remote.\nContract Receivables and Contract Assets\nAlthough we generally require full payment from our customers prior to their cruise, we grant credit terms to a relatively small portion of our revenue sourced in select markets outside of the United States. As a result, we have outstanding receivables from passenger cruise contracts in those markets. We also have receivables from credit card merchants for cruise ticket purchases and goods and services sold to guests during cruises that are collected before, during or shortly after the cruise voyage. In addition, we have receivables due from concessionaires onboard our vessels. These receivables are included within \nTrade and other receivables, net\n in our consolidated balance sheets. \nOur credit card processing agreements require us, under certain circumstances, to maintain a reserve that can be satisfied by posting collateral. As of December 31, 2024, none of our credit card processors required us to maintain a reserve.\nWe have contract assets that are conditional rights to consideration for satisfying the construction services performance obligations under a service concession arrangement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our contract assets were $\n161\n million and $\n167\n million, respectively, and were included within \nOther assets \nin our consolidated balance sheets. Given the short duration of our cruises and our collection terms, we do not have any other significant contract assets.\nAssets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nPrepaid travel advisor commissions and prepaid credit and debit card fees are an incremental cost of obtaining contracts with customers that we recognize as an asset and include within \nPrepaid expenses and other assets\n in our consolidated balance sheets. Prepaid travel advisor commissions and prepaid credit and debit card fees were $\n252\n million and $\n257\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our prepaid travel advisor commissions and prepaid credit and debit card fees are recognized at the time of revenue recognition or at the time of voyage cancellation, and are reported primarily within \nCommissions, transportation and other\n in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nNote 4\n. Goodwill\nAs of November 30, 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment review and determined there was \nno\n impairment of goodwill for the Silversea Cruises and Royal Caribbean reporting units.\nIn respect to the Silversea Cruises reporting unit, we determined the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately \n63\n%, as of November 30, 2024. We did not perform interim impairment evaluations during the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024 as no triggering events were identified. We used a probability weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach for the Silversea reporting unit. This requires the use of assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainties.\nThe principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model that support our Silversea Cruises reporting unit goodwill impairment assessment consisted of:\n•\nForecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day; \n•\nOccupancy rates from existing vessels;\n•\nVessel operating expenses;\n•\nTerminal growth rate; and\n•\nWeighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate) \nFor the Royal Caribbean Reporting unit, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more-likely-than not that our Royal Caribbean reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying amount. The qualitative analysis included assessing the impact of certain factors such as general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Based on our qualitative \nF-16\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nassessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the Royal Caribbean reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. We did not perform interim impairment evaluations during the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024 as no triggering events were identified. \nThe carrying value of goodwill attributable to our Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises reporting units during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nRoyal Caribbean\nCelebrity Cruises\nSilversea Cruises\nTotal\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n296\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n509\n \n$\n809\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n296\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n509\n \n$\n808\n \nAccumulated impairment losses to the carrying value of goodwill attributable to our reporting units were $\n576\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNote 5.\n Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of finite and indefinite-life assets and are reported within \nOther assets\n in our consolidated balance sheets. \nAs of November 30, 2024, we performed our annual trade name impairment review and determined no impairment losses existed at the date of this annual assessment for this indefinite-life intangible asset. We determined the fair value of the Silversea Cruises trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately \n66\n% at the date of this annual assessment. We did not perform interim impairment evaluations during the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024 as no triggering events were identified.\nThe determination of our trade name fair values using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset, such as the relief-from-royalty method, requires the use of assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainties. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses that support the Silversea Cruises trade name impairment assessment consisted of:\n•\nForecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day;\n•\nOccupancy rates from existing vessels;\n•\nTerminal growth rate;\n•\nRoyalty rate; and\n•\nWeighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).\nThe following is a summary of our intangible assets as of December 31, 2024 (in millions, except weighted average amortization period):\nAs of December 31, 2024\nRemaining Weighted Average Amortization Period (Years)\nGross Carrying Value \nAccumulated Amortization\nAccumulated Impairment Losses\nNet Carrying Value\nFinite-life intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships \n8.6\n$\n97\n \n$\n42\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n55\n \nGalapagos operating license \n19.6\n41\n \n13\n \n—\n \n28\n \nTotal finite-life intangible assets\n138\n \n55\n \n—\n \n83\n \nIndefinite-life intangible assets \n(1)\n352\n \n— \n31\n \n321\n \nTotal intangible assets, net\n$\n490\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n31\n \n$\n404\n \n(1)\n \nPrimarily relates to the Silversea Cruises trade name representing approximately $\n319\n million.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following is a summary of our intangible assets as of December 31, 2023 (in millions, except weighted average amortization period):\nAs of December 31, 2023\nRemaining Weighted Average Amortization Period (Years)\nGross Carrying Value\nAccumulated Amortization\nAccumulated Impairment Losses\nNet Carrying Value\nFinite-life intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships \n9.6\n$\n97\n \n$\n35\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n62\n \nGalapagos operating license \n20.6\n48\n \n13\n \n—\n \n35\n \nTotal finite-life intangible assets\n145\n \n48\n \n—\n \n97\n \nIndefinite-life intangible assets \n(1)\n352\n \n— \n31\n \n321\n \nTotal intangible assets, net\n$\n497\n \n$\n48\n \n$\n31\n \n$\n418\n \n(1)\n Primarily relates to the Silversea Cruises trade name representing approximately $\n319\n million.\nThe estimated future amortization for finite-life intangible assets for each of the next five years is $\n8\n million.\n \nNote 6\n.

We capitalized interest costs of $\n63\n million, $\n99\n million, and $\n64\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn May 2024, we took delivery of \nSilver Ray\n. In June 2024, we took delivery of \nUtopia of the Seas. \nRefer\n \nto\n \nNote 8\n. Debt \nfor further information on the financings for\n Silver Ray and Utopia of the Seas. \nIn June 2023, we took delivery of \nSilver Nova. \nIn November 2023, we took delivery of \nCelebrity Ascent\n and \nIcon of the Seas.\n \nIn our consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the acceptance of the ships and satisfaction of our obligations under the shipbuilding contract were classified as outflows and constructive disbursements within Investing Activities while the amounts novated and effectively advanced from our lenders under our previously committed financing arrangements were classified as inflows and constructive receipts within Financing Activities.\nLong-lived Assets impairments\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, there were no material impairment charges recognized. Any impairment charges recognized on \nLong-lived Assets\n used in our operations are generally reported within \nOther operating\n in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNote 7\n. Investments and Other Assets\nA Variable Interest Entity (\"VIE\") is an entity in which the equity investors have not provided enough equity to finance the entity's activities or the equity investors (1) cannot directly or indirectly make decisions about the entity's activities through their voting rights or similar rights; (2) do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity; (3) do not have the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (4) have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the entity's activities involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest. We hold equity interests in ventures related to our cruise operations. We account for the majority of these investments as either an equity method investment or a controlled subsidiary.\nIn 2023, we closed on the partnership agreement with iCON Infrastructure Partners VI, L.P. (\"iCON\"). This partnership owns, develops, and manages cruise terminal facilities and infrastructure in key ports of call, initially including several development projects in Italy and Spain. As part of the transaction with iCON we also sold \n80\n% of the entity which owns our terminal at PortMiami. Refer below to \nequity method investments\n and \ncontrolled subsidiarie\ns for further information on the transaction. In addition, the partnership will pursue additional port infrastructure developments, including future plans to own, develop, and manage an infrastructure project in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nUnconsolidated investments (\"equity method investments\")\nWe have determined that TUI Cruises GmbH (\"TUIC\"), our \n50\n%-owned joint venture, which operates the brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, is a VIE. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of TUIC. We believe that the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact TUIC’s economic performance is shared between ourselves and TUI AG, our joint venture partner. All the significant operating and financial decisions of TUIC require the consent of both parties, which we believe creates shared power over TUIC. Accordingly, we do not consolidate this entity and account for this investment under the equity method of accounting.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the net book value of our investment in TUIC was $\n814\n million, primarily consisting of $\n749\n million in equity and a loan of €\n55\n million, or approximately $\n57\n million, based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the net book value of our investment in TUIC was $\n657\n million, primarily consisting of $\n566\n million in equity and a loan of €\n71\n million, or approximately $\n79\n million, based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2023. The loan, which was made in connection with the sale of \nSplendour of the Seas\n in April 2016, accrues interest at a rate of \n6.25\n% per annum and is payable over \n10\n years. This loan is \n50\n% guaranteed by TUI AG and is secured by a first priority mortgage on the ship.\nTUIC has various ship construction and financing agreements which include certain restrictions on each of our and TUI AG’s ability to reduce our current ownership interest in TUIC below \n37.55\n% through May 2033. Our investment amount and outstanding term loan are substantially our maximum exposure to loss in connection with our investment in TUIC. \nWe have determined that Grand Bahama Shipyard Ltd. (\"Grand Bahama\"), a ship repair and maintenance facility in which we have a \n49\n% noncontrolling interest, is a VIE. This facility serves cruise and cargo ships, oil and gas tankers and offshore units. We utilize this facility, among other ship repair facilities, for our regularly scheduled drydocks and certain emergency repairs as may be required. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of this facility, as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the facility's economic performance. Accordingly, we do not consolidate this entity and account for this investment under the equity method of accounting. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we acquired an additional \n9\n% ownership interest in Grand Bahama for an immaterial amount, taking our noncontrolling interest from \n40\n% to \n49\n%.\nIn 2023, we formed a \n50\n%-owned joint venture with the other \n49\n% shareholder of Grand Bahama to operate Floating Docks S. DE RL. (“Floating Docks”). Floating Docks will construct \ntwo\n floating drydocks, with delivery dates expected in 2025 and 2026, that will be leased to Grand Bahama and allow it to service the entire range of cruise ships in operation and under construction, as well as much of the world’s commercial shipping fleet. We and our joint venture partner have each guaranteed \n50\n% of certain installment payments payable by Floating Docks under the drydock and related construction contracts, which are contingent on the achievement of certain construction milestones, bringing our total payment guarantees to $\n37\n million as of December 31, 2024. Our investment in Floating Docks is $\n80\n million as of December 31, 2024.\nWe have determined that Floating Docks is a VIE. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of Floating Docks since we believe that the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Floating Docks' economic performance is shared between ourselves and our joint venture partner. All the significant operating and financial decisions of \nF-19\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nFloating Docks require the consent of both parties which we believe creates shared power over Floating Docks. Accordingly, we do not consolidate this entity and account for this investment under the equity method of accounting.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell one-third of our ownership interests in both Grand Bahama and Floating Docks. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.\nIn 2023, as part of the transaction with iCON, we sold our controlling interest in \ntwo\n Italian entities for an immaterial amount of net proceeds and recognized an immaterial gain on the sale. We have determined that the partnership and both Italian entities are VIE's. These entities in Italy represent development projects to own, develop, and manage cruise terminal facilities in key ports of call. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary for either of these entities as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance. Accordingly, we do not consolidate these entities and account for these investments under the equity method of accounting.\nThe following tables set forth information regarding our investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, including the entities discussed above (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nShare of equity income from investments \n$\n260\n \n$\n200\n \n$\n57\n \nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nTotal notes receivable due from equity investments\n$\n138\n \n$\n105\n \nLess-current portion\n (1)\n17\n \n19\n \nLong-term portion\n (2)\n$\n121\n \n$\n86\n \n___________________________________________________________________\n(1)     \nIncluded within \nTrade and other receivables, net \nin our consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)\n    \nIncluded within \nOther assets\n in our consolidated balance sheets.\nSummarized financial information for our affiliates accounted for under the equity method of accounting was as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nCurrent assets\n$\n589\n \n$\n528\n \nNon-current assets\n5,997\n \n5,264\n \nTotal assets\n$\n6,586\n \n$\n5,792\n \nCurrent liabilities\n$\n1,470\n \n$\n1,464\n \nNon-current liabilities\n3,299\n \n2,907\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n4,769\n \n$\n4,371\n \nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal revenues\n$\n2,524\n \n$\n2,328\n \n$\n1,539\n \nTotal expenses\n(\n1,978\n)\n(\n1,857\n)\n(\n1,416\n)\nNet income (loss) \n$\n546\n \n$\n471\n \n$\n123\n \nF-20\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nConsolidated investments (\"controlled subsidiaries\")\nAs described above, we hold equity interests in ventures related to our cruise operations. We account for these investments as a controlled subsidiary when we determine we are the primary beneficiary.\nAs part of the transaction with iCON, we sold an \n80\n% interest in the entity which owns our terminal at PortMiami for $\n209\n million and retained a \n20\n% minority interest, effective March 31, 2023. The cash consideration received for the sale of the PortMiami terminal company, net of transaction costs, was allocated between paid in capital and noncontrolling interest using the net book value of our investment in the PortMiami terminal, as presented in the statement of shareholders' equity. As part of the transaction, we also sold a noncontrolling interest in another entity which is developing a port project in Spain for an immaterial amount. We have determined that both of these entities are VIEs, and we are the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the facility’s economic performance.

As of December 31, 2024, we had undrawn capacity of $\n3.7\n billion under our unsecured revolving credit facilities.\nConvertible Notes due 2025\nIn August 2024, we completed a privately negotiated exchange with a limited number of holders of the \n6.00\n% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025. The holders exchanged approximately $\n827\n million in aggregate principal amount for approximately \n11.4\n million shares of common stock and $\n827\n million in cash, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The issuance of equity increased additional paid in capital by an immaterial amount.\n2024 Debt financing transactions\nIn March 2024, we issued $\n1.25\n billion of senior unsecured notes due in 2032 for net proceeds of approximately $\n1.24\n billion. Interest accrues on the notes at a fixed rate of \n6.25\n% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears. The proceeds from this notes issuance, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem all of the outstanding $\n1.25\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n11.625\n% Senior Notes due 2027. The repayment resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n116\n million that was recognized within \nInterest expense, net of interest capitalized\n within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIn August 2024, we issued $\n2.0\n billion of senior unsecured notes due in 2033 for net proceeds of approximately $\n1.98\n billion.

Upon closing, we terminated our commitment for the $\n700\n million \n364\n-day term loan facility. In addition, the remaining $\n350\n million backstop committed financing was also terminated upon closing, which resulted in an immaterial loss on extinguishment of debt.\nDuring 2023, we repaid the remaining $\n1.4\n billion of our \n11.50\n% secured senior notes due June 2025, which resulted in a total loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n105\n million that was recognized within \nInterest expense, net of interest capitalized\n within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nIn October 2023, we paid the remaining $\n502\n million of the $\n0.6\n billion unsecured term loan due October 2023 which was previously amended in September 2022 to extend the maturity date of advances under the facilities held by consenting lenders by 12 months to October 2024. The payment resulted in an immaterial loss on extinguishment of debt recognized within \nInterest expense, net of interest capitalized\n within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n2024 Export credit facilities and agency guarantees\nIn May 2024, we took delivery of \nSilver Ray\n. To finance the delivery, we borrowed $\n507\n million under the committed financing agreement, resulting in an unsecured term loan which is \n95\n% guaranteed by Euler Hermes. The unsecured loan amortizes semi-annually over \n12\n years and bears interest at a fixed rate of \n4.33\n% per annum.\nIn June 2024, we took delivery of \nUtopia of the Seas\n. To finance the delivery, we borrowed a total of $\n1.5\n billion under the committed financing agreement, resulting in an unsecured term loan which is \n100\n% guaranteed by BpiFrance Assurance Export. The unsecured term loan amortizes semi-annually over \n12\n years and bears interest primarily at a fixed rate of \n3.00\n% per annum.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we repaid $\n839\n million of outstanding deferred amounts under our export credit facilities, which eliminated the restriction on dividends and share repurchases. These repayments included both scheduled payments and an early repayment of the amortization deferral obtained on our export credit facilities in 2020 and 2021, which resulted in an immaterial loss on extinguishment of debt that was recognized within \nInterest expense, net of interest capitalized\n within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n2023 Export credit facilities and agency guarantees\nIn June 2023, we took delivery of \nSilver Nova\n. To finance the delivery, we borrowed a total of $\n503\n million under the committed financing agreement, resulting in an unsecured term loan which is \n95\n% guaranteed by Euler Hermes. The unsecured loan amortizes semi-annually over \n12\n years and bears interest at a fixed rate of \n4.21\n% per annum.\nIn November 2023, we took delivery of \nCelebrity Ascent\n. To finance the delivery, we borrowed a total of $\n844\n million under the committed financing agreement, resulting in an unsecured term loan which is \n100\n% guaranteed by Bpifrance Assurance Export. The unsecured loan amortizes semi-annually over \n12\n years. The majority of the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of \n3.18\n% per annum and a portion of the loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to Term SOFR plus a margin of \n1.45\n%. Based on applicable Term SOFR rates, as of December 31, 2023, the unsecured term loan weighted average interest rate was \n3.33\n%.\nF-23\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nIn November 2023, we took delivery of \nIcon of the Seas\n. To finance the delivery, we borrowed a total of $\n1.8\n billion under the committed financing agreement, resulting in an unsecured term loan which is primarily guaranteed \n100\n% by Finnvera plc and the remaining smaller portion guaranteed \n95\n% by Euler Hermes. The unsecured loan amortizes semi-annually over \n12\n years. The majority of the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of \n3.56\n% per annum and a portion of the loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to Term SOFR plus a margin of \n1.53\n% - \n1.58\n%. Based on applicable Term SOFR rates, as of December 31, 2023, the unsecured term loan weighted average interest rate was \n4.76\n%.\nAll of our unsecured ship financing term loans are guaranteed by the export credit agency in the respective country in which the ship is constructed. For the majority of the loans as of December 31, 2024, we pay to the applicable export credit agency, depending on the financing agreement, an upfront fee of \n2.35\n% to \n5.48\n% of the maximum loan amount in consideration for these guarantees. We amortize the fees that are paid upfront over the life of the loan. We classify these fees within \nAmortization of debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums \nin our consolidated statements of cash flows. Prior to the loan being drawn, we present these fees within \nOther assets\n in our consolidated balance sheets. Once the loan is drawn, such fees are classified as a discount to the related loan, or contra-liability account, within \nCurrent portion of long-term debt \nor\n long-term debt\n.\nDebt covenants\nOur revolving credit facilities, the majority of our term loans, and certain of our credit card processing agreements, contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio, limit our net debt-to-capital ratio, and to maintain minimum liquidity. In July 2024, we amended all of our export credit facilities to eliminate the contractual requirement for us to maintain a minimum level of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and we estimate we will be in compliance for the next twelve months. \nAnnual maturities\nThe following is a schedule of annual maturities on our total debt including finance leases, as of December 31, 2024 for each of the next five years (in millions):\nYear\nAs of December 31, 2024 (1)\n2025\n$\n1,604\n \n2026\n2,927\n \n2027\n2,587\n \n2028\n3,413\n \n2029\n998\n \nThereafter\n9,075\n \n$\n20,604\n \n(1)    \nDebt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at December 31, 2024.\nNote 9\n. Leases\nOperating leases\nOur operating leases primarily relate to preferred berthing arrangements, real estate, and shipboard equipment which are included within \nOperating lease right-of-use asset\ns and \nLong-term operating lease liabilities, \nwith the current portion of the liability included within \nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities\n in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe company's preferred berthing agreement with Miami-Dade County (\"County\") includes the development plans for the County to finance the construction of a new and improved cruise Terminal G at PortMiami. The aggregate amount of the operating lease liabilities recorded for this berthing agreement was $\n168\n million and $\n167\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There will be future remeasurements of the operating lease as the County completes several construction milestones throughout the term of the extended lease, including an expected remeasurement in 2027 or later, when \nF-24\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nthe County satisfies substantial completion of Terminal G, as the minimum lease payments will increase at such time to approximately $\n55\n million per year, with expected \n3\n% annual increases thereafter.\nFor some of our real estate leases and berthing agreements, we do have the option to extend our current lease term. For those lease agreements with renewal options, the renewal periods for real estate leases primarily range from \none\n to \n10\n years and the renewal periods for berthing agreements primarily range from \none\n to \n20\n years. Generally, we do not include renewal options as a component of our present value calculation for berthing agreements. However, for certain real estate leases, we include them. \nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. We estimate our incremental borrowing rates based on Term SOFR and U.S. Treasury note rates corresponding to lease terms increased by the Company’s credit risk spread and reduced by the estimated impact of collateral. In addition, we have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. However, for berthing agreements, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nFinance leases\nOur finance leases primarily relate to buildings and surrounding land located at our Miami headquarters. Finance leases are included within \nProperty, and Equipment\n, \nnet, \nand \nLong-term debt \nwith the current portion of the liability included within \nCurrent portion of long-term debt \nin our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company's master lease agreement (“Master Lease”) with Miami-Dade County related to the buildings and surrounding land located at our Miami headquarters is classified as a finance lease in accordance with ASC 842, \nLeases\n. The Master Lease includes \ntwo\n \nfive-year\n options to extend the lease which we are reasonably certain to exercise. In November 2023, we executed a modification to the Master Lease agreement to extend its expiration from 2076 to 2077 after coming to an agreement with Miami-Dade County on the financing plans to finalize the development of the buildings and land. The modification of the Master Lease did not change the classification of the lease. The total aggregate amount of the finance lease liabilities recorded for this Master Lease was $\n106\n million and $\n104\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The development of the new campus buildings are expected to be completed in 2026, and the lease components will be recorded within our consolidated financial statements upon commencement.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, we executed the bargain purchase option and paid in full all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the \nSilver Dawn \nfinance lease for approximately $\n227\n million, which resulted in an immaterial loss on extinguishment of debt that was recognized within \nInterest expense, net of interest capitalized\n within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nF-25\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nSupplemental balance sheet information for leases was as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\nLease assets:\nFinance lease right-of-use assets, net:\nProperty and equipment, gross\n$\n146\n \n$\n520\n \nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n50\n)\n(\n69\n)\nProperty and equipment, net\n96\n \n451\n \nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n677\n \n611\n \nTotal lease assets\n$\n773\n \n$\n1,062\n \nLease liabilities:\nFinance lease liabilities:\nCurrent portion of debt\n$\n7\n \n$\n26\n \n   \nLong-term debt\n \n110\n \n343\n \nTotal finance lease liabilities\n117\n \n369\n \nOperating lease liabilities:\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities\n74\n \n65\n \nLong-term operating lease liabilities\n670\n \n613\n \nTotal operating lease liabilities\n744\n \n678\n \nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n861\n \n$\n1,047\n \nThe components of lease expense were as follows (in millions):\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) Classification\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nLease costs:\nOperating lease costs\nCommission, transportation and other\n$\n208\n \n$\n183\n \n$\n127\n \nOperating lease costs\nOther operating expenses\n14\n \n22\n \n22\n \nOperating lease costs\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses\n19\n \n21\n \n19\n \nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of right-of-use-assets\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\n13\n \n22\n \n24\n \nInterest on lease liabilities\nInterest expense, net of interest capitalized\n30\n \n30\n \n22\n \nTotal lease costs\n$\n284\n \n$\n278\n \n$\n214\n \nIn addition, certain of our berthing agreements include variable lease costs based on the number of passengers berthed.

Shareholders' Equity\nOn January 1, 2022, we adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach to recognize our convertible notes as single liability instruments. As a result of the adoption of this pronouncement, the cumulative effect to \nShareholders' equity \nwas a reduction of $\n162\n million.\nDividends \nDuring the fourth and third quarters of 2024, our Board of Directors declared dividends of $\n0.55\n and $\n0.40\n per share which were paid in the January 2025 and October 2024, respectively. We did \nnot\n declare any dividends during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. During the second quarter of 2024, we repaid the principal amounts deferred under our export credit facilities, which eliminated the restriction on dividends and share repurchases. Refer\n \nto\n \nNote 8\n. Debt\n for further information on the transaction.\nIn February 2025, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $\n0.75\n per share, payable in April 2025.\nF-27\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNoncontrolling Interests\nIn 2023, we closed the partnership with iCON. We sold \n80\n% of the entity which owns our terminal at PortMiami for $\n209\n million and retained a \n20\n% minority interest. The cash consideration received, net of transaction costs, was allocated between paid-in capital and noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated statement of shareholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 7.\n Investments and Other Assets\n for further information on the transaction.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2025, our board of directors authorized a 12-month common stock repurchase program for up to $\n1\n billion. The timing and number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price and market conditions. Repurchases under the program may be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.\nNote 11\n. Stock-Based Employee Compensation\nWe currently have awards outstanding under \none\n stock-based compensation plan, our 2008 Equity Plan, which provides for awards to our officers, directors and key employees. The 2008 Equity Plan, as amended, provides for the issuance of up to \n10,083,570\n shares of our common stock pursuant to grants of (i) incentive and non-qualified stock options, (ii) stock appreciation rights, (iii) stock awards (including time-based and/or performance-based stock awards) and (iv) restricted stock units (including time-based and performance-based restricted stock units). During any calendar year, no one individual (other than non-employee members of our board of directors) may be granted awards of more than \n500,000\n shares and no non-employee member of our board of directors may be granted awards with a value, measured as of the grant date, which together with cash compensation paid to such director for such calendar year, would exceed $\n750,000\n. Restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2024, generally vest in equal installments over \nthree\n or \nfour years\n from the date of grant. In addition, performance shares and performance share units generally vest in \nthree years\n. With certain limited exceptions, awards are forfeited if the recipient ceases to be an employee before the shares vest.\nOur officers receive their long-term incentive awards through a combination of performance share units and restricted stock units. Each performance share unit award is expressed as a target number of performance share units based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date the award is issued. The actual number of shares underlying each award (not to exceed \n200\n% of the target number of performance share units) will be determined based upon the Company's achievement of a specified performance target range. In 2024, we issued a target number of \n272,583\n performance share units, which will vest approximately \nthree years\n following the award issue date. The performance payout of these grants will be based on return on the Company's invested capital (\"ROIC\"), adjusted earnings per share (\"Adjusted EPS\"), and Carbon Intensity Reduction for the year ended December 31, 2024, to December 31, 2026, as may be adjusted by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our board of directors in early 2027 for events that are outside of management's control.\nOur senior officers meeting certain minimum age and service criteria receive their long-term incentive awards through a combination of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. The restricted stock awards are subject to both performance and time-based vesting criteria while the restricted stock units are subject only to time-based vesting criteria. Each restricted stock award is issued in an amount equal to \n200\n% of the target number of shares underlying the award based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date the award is issued. Declared dividends accrue (but do not get paid) on the restricted stock awards during the vesting period, with the accrued amounts to be paid out following vesting only on the number of shares underlying the award which actually vest based on satisfaction of the performance criteria. The actual number of shares that vest (not to exceed \n200\n% of the shares) will be determined based upon the Company's achievement of a specified performance target range. \nIn 2024, we issued \n87,937\n restricted stock awards, representing \n200\n% of the target number of shares underlying the award, all of which are considered issued and outstanding from the date of issuance; however, grantees will only retain those shares earned as the result of the Company achieving the performance goals during the measurement period. The performance payout of the 2024 awards will be based on the Company's ROIC, Adjusted EPS, and Carbon Intensity Reduction for the year ended December 31, 2024, to December 31, 2026, as may be adjusted by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our board of directors in early 2027 for events that are outside of management's control.\nWe also provide an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") to facilitate the purchase by employees of up to \n2,800,000\n shares of common stock in the aggregate. Offerings to employees are made on a quarterly basis. Subject to certain limitations, the purchase price for each share of common stock is equal to \n85\n% of the average of the market prices of the common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the first business day of the purchase period and the last business day of each \nF-28\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nmonth of the purchase period.

Retirement Plan\nWe maintain a defined contribution plan covering shoreside employees. Effective January 1, 2016, we commenced annual, non-elective contributions to the plan on behalf of all eligible participants equal to \n3\n% of participants' eligible earnings. Additional annual contributions to the plan are discretionary and are based on fixed percentages of participants' salaries and years of service, not to exceed certain maximums. Contribution expenses were $\n23\n million, $\n21\n million and $\n20\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \nNote 14\n. Income Taxes\nWe are subject to corporate income taxes in countries where we have operations or subsidiaries. We and the majority of our ship-operating and vessel-owning subsidiaries are currently exempt from U.S. corporate income tax on U.S. source income from the international operation of ships pursuant to Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code. Regulations under Section 883 have limited the activities that are considered the international operation of a ship or incidental thereto. Accordingly, our provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes includes taxes on certain activities not considered incidental to the international operation of our ships.\nAdditionally, one of our ship-operating subsidiaries is subject to tax under the tonnage tax regime of the United Kingdom. Under this regime, income from qualifying activities is subject to corporate income tax, but the tax is computed by reference to the tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the tax regimes (the \"relevant shipping profits\"), which replaces the regular taxable income base. Income from activities not considered qualifying activities, which we do not consider significant, remains subject to United-Kingdom corporate income tax.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we had an income tax expense of approximately $\n46\n million, $\n6\n million, and $\n4\n million, respectively, primarily driven by income tax from our non-US operations and items not qualifying under Section 883, tonnage tax and income taxes for the remainder of our subsidiaries. Income taxes are recorded within \nOther income (expense)\n. In addition, all interest expense and penalties related to income tax liabilities are classified as income tax expense within \nOther income (expense)\n.\nFor a majority of our subsidiaries, we do not expect to incur income taxes on future distributions of undistributed earnings. Accordingly, no deferred income taxes have been provided for the distribution of these earnings. Where we do expect to incur income taxes on future distributions of undistributed earnings, we have provided for deferred taxes, which we do not consider significant to our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had deferred tax assets for U.S. and foreign net operating losses (“NOLs”) of approximately $\n32\n million and deferred tax assets for U.S. and foreign tax credits of approximately $\n19\n million.\nWe regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability based on our history of earnings, expectations of future earnings, and tax planning strategies. Realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to support the amount of deferred taxes. A valuation allowance is recorded in those circumstances in which we conclude it is not more-likely-than-not we will recover the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have provided a valuation allowance for approximately $\n15\n million of deferred tax assets for NOLs and tax credits. $\n5\n million of the NOLs deferred tax assets relate to NOLs which are subject to expire between 2025 and 2042 and $\n18\n million of the tax credits deferred tax assets relate to credits which are subject to expire between 2037 and 2039.\nOur deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and corresponding valuation allowances related to our operations were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nF-31\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNote 15\n.

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had counterparty credit risk exposure under our derivative instruments of $\n21\n million and $\n125\n million, respectively, which was limited to the cost of replacing the contracts in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the contracts, the majority of which are currently our lending banks. We do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our significant counterparties. In addition, we have established guidelines we follow regarding credit ratings and instrument maturities to maintain safety and liquidity. We do not normally require collateral or other security to support credit relationships; however, in certain circumstances this option is available to us.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies. The financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the notional amount, term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged. Although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. \nWe enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments.\nF-36\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, a derivative instrument that hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or a recognized asset or liability is designated as a fair value hedge. A derivative instrument that hedges a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are offset against changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments. Gains and losses on derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings. The foreign currency transaction gain or loss of our non-derivative financial instruments and the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of our net investment in foreign operations and investments are recognized as a component of \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n along with the associated foreign currency translation adjustment of the foreign operation or investment. In certain hedges of our net investment in foreign operations and investments, we exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize the related amounts directly into earnings.\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess whether derivatives used in hedging transactions are \"highly effective\" in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of hedged items. For our net investment hedges, we use the dollar offset method to measure effectiveness. For all other hedging programs, we use the long-haul method to assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis for each hedge relationship. The methodology for assessing hedge effectiveness is applied on a consistent basis for each one of our hedging programs (i.e., interest rate, foreign currency ship construction, foreign currency net investment and fuel). For our regression analyses, we use an observation period of up to \nthree years\n, utilizing market data relevant to the hedge horizon of each hedge relationship. High effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the changes in the fair values of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or hedge accounting is discontinued, any change in fair value of the derivative since the last date at which it was determined to be highly effective is recognized in earnings. \nWe consider the classification of the underlying hedged item’s cash flows in determining the classification for the designated derivative instrument’s cash flows. Cash flows from derivative instruments that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged items. In the event that hedge accounting is discontinued, cash flows subsequent to the date of discontinuance are classified within investing activities. Cash flows from derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are classified as investing activities. For example, we classify derivative instrument cash flows from hedges of benchmark interest rate or hedges of fuel expense as operating activities due to the nature of the hedged item. Likewise, we classify derivative instrument cash flows from hedges of foreign currency risk on our newbuild ship payments as investing activities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our debt obligations including future interest payments. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately \n92.3\n% and \n83.2\n%, respectively, of our debt was effectively fixed-rate debt, which is net of our interest rate swap agreements. We use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense.\nMarket risk associated with our fixed-rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates. \nAt \nDecember 31, 2024\n, there were no interest rate swap agreements for fixed-rate debt instruments.\nF-37\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nWe use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis to manage the risk of increasing interest rates. \nAt December 31, 2024, we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floating-rate debt instruments:\nDebt Instrument\nSwap Notional as of December 31, 2024 (In millions)\nMaturity\nDebt Floating Rate\nSpread\nAll-in Fixed Rate\nQuantum of the Seas\n term loan\n123\n \nOctober 2026\nTerm SOFR plus\n1.30\n%\n3.78\n%\nAnthem of the Seas\n term loan\n151\n \nApril 2027\nTerm SOFR plus\n1.30\n%\n3.9\n%\nOvation of the Seas\n term loan \n242\n \nApril 2028\nTerm SOFR plus\n1.00\n%\n3.20\n%\nHarmony of the Seas\n term loan\n (1)\n209\n \nMay 2028\nEURIBOR plus\n1.15\n%\n2.26\n%\nOdyssey of the Seas \nterm loan\n(2)\n307\n \nOctober 2032\nTerm SOFR plus\n0.96\n%\n3.28\n%\nOdyssey of the Seas \nterm loan\n(2)\n153\n \nOctober 2032\nTerm SOFR plus\n0.96\n%\n2.91\n%\n$\n1,185\n \n___________________________________________________________________\n(1)\n    \nInterest rate swap agreements hedging the Euro-denominated term loan for \nHarmony of the Seas\n include EURIBOR zero-floors matching the hedged debt EURIBOR zero-floor. Amount presented is based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2024.\n(2)    Interest rate swap agreements hedging the term loan of \nOdyssey of the Seas\n include Term SOFR zero-floors, Term SOFR with no floors, and Overnight SOFR.\nThese interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges\nThe notional amount of interest rate swap agreements related to outstanding debt as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n1.2\n billion and $\n1.6\n billion, respectively.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk \nDerivative Instruments\nOur primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in Euros, our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate cost of our ships on order was $\n7.8\n billion, of which we had deposited $\n815\n million as of such date. These amounts do not include any ships placed on order that are contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and/or financing any ships on order by our Partner Brands. Refer to Note 17.\n Commitments and Contingencies\n, for further information on our ships on order. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately \n43.4\n% and \n43.5\n%, respectively, of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate. Our foreign currency forward contract agreements are accounted for as cash flow or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge.\nOn a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 the average notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts was approximately $\n1.1\n billion and $\n1.3\n billion, respectively. These instruments are not designated as hedging instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in (losses) gains of $(\n77\n) million, $\n19\n million and $(\n102\n) million, respectively, which offset gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of $\n65\n million, $(\n43\n) million and $\n93\n million, respectively. These amounts were recognized in earnings within \nOther income (expense) \nin our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nThe notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts, excluding the forward contracts entered into to minimize remeasurement volatility, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n2.7\n billion and $\n2.9\n billion, respectively.\nNon-Derivative Instruments\nWe consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and to be of a long-term nature. We address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries' \nF-38\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nand investments' functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments. We had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments in TUI Cruises of €\n889\n million, or approximately $\n921\n million, as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of €\n648\n million, or approximately $\n716\n million.\nFuel Price Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships. We use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices.\nOur fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges. In the case that our hedged forecasted fuel consumption is not probable of occurring, hedge accounting will be discontinued and the related accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be reclassified to \nOther income (expense) \nimmediately. For hedged forecasted fuel consumption that remains possible of occurring, hedge accounting will be discontinued and the related accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will remain in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings or the related hedged forecasted fuel consumption is deemed probable of not occurring. \nChanges in the fair value of fuel swaps for which cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued are currently recognized in\n Other income (expense) \nfor each reporting period through the maturity dates of the fuel swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we did not discontinue cash flow hedge accounting on any of our fuel swap agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting on certain fuel swap agreements, which resulted in an immaterial gain.\nAt December 31, 2024, we have hedged the variability in future cash flows for certain forecasted fuel transactions occurring through 2025 and 2027. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had the following outstanding fuel swap agreements:\nFuel Swap Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\n(metric tons)\nDesignated as hedges:\n2025\n1,031,449\n \n685,400\n \n2026\n786,750\n \n44,200\n \n2027\n364,048\n \n—\n \nFuel Swap Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\n(% hedged)\nDesignated hedges as a % of projected fuel purchases:\n2025\n60\n \n%\n39\n \n%\n2026\n44\n \n%\n3\n \n%\n2027\n20\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nAt December 31, 2024, there was $\n9\n million of estimated unrealized net loss associated with our cash flow hedges pertaining to fuel swap agreements that is expected to be reclassified to earnings from \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n within the next twelve months when compared to $\n21\n million of estimated unrealized net loss at December 31, 2023.

Specifically, under most of our agreements, if on the fifth anniversary of executing a derivative instrument, or on any succeeding fifth-year anniversary, our credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt is rated below BBB- by Standard & Poor’s and Baa3 by Moody’s, then the counterparty will periodically have the right to demand that we post collateral in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the net market value of all derivative transactions with such counterparty that have reached their fifth year anniversary, to the extent negative, and (ii) the applicable minimum call amount.\nThe amount of collateral required to be posted will change as, and to the extent, our net liability position increases or decreases by more than the applicable minimum call amount. If our credit rating for our senior unsecured debt is subsequently equal to or above BBB- by Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s, then any collateral posted at such time will be released to us and we will no longer be required to post collateral unless we meet the collateral trigger requirement, generally, at the next fifth-year anniversary. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our senior unsecured debt credit rating was BB+ by Standard & Poor's and Ba1 by Moody's. As of December 31, 2024, \nfive\n of our ship debt interest rate derivative hedges had reached their fifth-year anniversary; however, the net market value for these derivative hedges were in a net asset position, and accordingly, we were not required to post any collateral as of such date. \nOn February 4, 2025, Standard & Poor's upgraded our unsecured debt credit rating from BB+ to BBB-.\nF-41\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNote 17.\n Commitments and Contingencies\nShip Purchase Obligations\nOur future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. As of December 31, 2024, we had \ntwo\n Icon-class ships and \none\n Oasis-class ship on order for our Royal Caribbean brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately \n16,900\n berths. As of December 31, 2024, we had \none\n Edge-class ship on order for our Celebrity brand with capacity of approximately \n3,250\n berths. The following provides further information on recent developments with respect to our ship orders.\nDuring 2017, we entered into a credit agreement for the unsecured financing of \nStar of the Seas, \nthe second Icon-class ship for up to \n80\n% of the contract price. Finnvera plc, has agreed to guarantee \n100\n% of a substantial majority of the financing to the lenders, with a smaller portion of the financing to be \n95\n% guaranteed by Euler Hermes. The maximum loan amount under the facility is not to exceed €\n1.4\n billion, or approximately $\n1.4\n billion, based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2024. Interest on approximately \n75\n% of the loan will accrue at a fixed rate of \n3.76\n%, and the balance will accrue interest at a floating rate ranging from Term SOFR plus \n1.58\n% to \n1.63\n%. The loan will amortize semi-annually and will mature \n12\n years following delivery of the ship. \nStar of the Seas\n will have a capacity of approximately \n5,600\n berths. In December 2024, we amended the credit agreement for \nStar of the Seas\n, to increase the maximum loan amount by €\n364\n million or $\n377\n million based on exchange rate at December 31, 2024. Interest on the incremental portion will accrue at a floating rate equal to Term SOFR plus \n0.85\n%.\nIn December 2023, we entered into a credit agreement for the unsecured financing of \nCelebrity Xcel\n, the fifth Edge-class ship for approximately \n80\n% of the ship’s contract price and our building contract with Chantiers de l'Atlantique became effective. Bpifrance Assurance Export, the official French export credit agency, has agreed to guarantee to the lenders \n100\n% of the financing. The maximum loan amount under the facility is not to exceed the United States dollar equivalent of €\n850\n million, or approximately $\n880\n million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2024. The loan will amortize semi-annually and will mature \n12\n years following delivery of the ship. Interest on the loan will accrue at a floating rate equal to Term SOFR + \n1.45\n%. \nCelebrity Xcel\n will have a capacity of approximately \n3,250\n berths.\nIn December 2019, we entered into a credit agreement for the unsecured financing of the third Icon-class ship for up to \n80\n% of the ship’s contract price. Finnvera plc, the official export credit agency of Finland, has agreed to guarantee \n95\n% of the substantial majority of the financing, with a smaller portion of the financing to be \n95\n% guaranteed by Euler Hermes. The maximum loan amount under the facility is not to exceed the United States dollar equivalent of €\n1.4\n billion, or approximately $\n1.4\n billion based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2024. The loan, once funded, will amortize semi-annually and will mature \n12\n years following the delivery of the ship. Approximately \n60\n% of the loan will accrue interest at a fixed rate of \n3.29\n%. The balance of the loan will accrue interest at a floating rate of Term SOFR plus \n1.28\n%. The third Icon-class ship will have a capacity of approximately \n5,600\n berths.\nF-42\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2024, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands have the following ships on order:\nShip\nShipyard\nExpected to be delivered\nApproximate\nBerths\nRoyal Caribbean —\nOasis-class:\nUnnamed\nChantiers de l’Atlantique\n2nd Quarter 2028\n5,700\nIcon-class:\nStar of the Seas\nMeyer Turku Oy\n3rd Quarter 2025\n5,600\nUnnamed\nMeyer Turku Oy\n2nd Quarter 2026\n5,600\nCelebrity Cruises —\nEdge-class:\nCelebrity Xcel\nChantiers de l’Atlantique\n4th Quarter 2025\n3,250\nTUI Cruises (50% joint venture) —\nMein Schiff Relax\nFincantieri\n1st Quarter 2025\n4,100\nMein Schiff Flow\nFincantieri\n2nd Quarter 2026\n4,100\nTotal Berths\n28,350\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, we received commitments for the unsecured financing of the seventh Oasis-class ship for up to \n80\n% of the ship’s contract price and our building contract with Chantiers de l'Atlantique became effective. Bpifrance Assurance Export, the official French export credit agency, has agreed to guarantee to the lenders \n100\n% of the financing.\nIn addition, during 2024, we entered into an agreement with Meyer Turku Oy and Chantiers de l' Atlantique to build a fourth Icon-class ship for delivery in 2027 and a sixth Edge-class ship for delivery in 2028. The agreements are contingent upon completion of certain conditions precedent including financing. \nIn January 2025, we announced the launch of Celebrity River Cruises, a premium river cruise vacation. We entered into agreements for the commitment to an initial order of \n10\n ships with plans to sail in 2027.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, presented in the table above, not including any ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately $\n7.8\n billion, of which we had deposited $\n815\n million. Refer to Note 16.\n Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments \nfor further information.\nLitigation\n \nAs previously reported, a lawsuit was filed against us in August 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the \"Court\") under Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act. The complaint filed by Havana Docks Corporation (\"Havana Docks Action\") alleges it holds an interest in the Havana Cruise Port Terminal, was expropriated by the Cuban government. The complaint further alleges that we trafficked in the terminal by embarking and disembarking passengers at these facilities. The plaintiffs seek all available statutory remedies, including the value of the expropriated property, plus interest, treble damages, attorneys’ fees and costs.\n \nThe Court entered final judgment in December 2022 in favor of the plaintiff and awarded damages and attorneys' fees to the plaintiff in the aggregate amount of approximately $\n112\n million. We then appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. On October 22, 2024, the 11th Circuit issued an opinion reversing the lower court’s judgment. The plaintiff's petition for a rehearing by the full 11th Circuit was subsequently denied. The plaintiff has the right to petition the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a charge of approximately $\n130\n million to \nOther (expense) income \nwithin our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) related to the Havana Docks Action, including post-judgment interest and related legal defense costs and bonding fees. Following the 11th Circuit's denial of the rehearing petition, we released approximately $\n124\n million of the previously recorded loss contingency for the year ended December 31, 2024, recognized within \nOther (expense) income\n within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nF-43\nTable of Contents\nROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nIn addition, we are routinely involved in claims typical within the cruise vacation industry. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance. We believe the outcome of such claims, net of expected insurance recoveries, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we entered into agreements to acquire the Port of Costa Maya and adjacent land in Mahahual, Mexico for approximately $\n292\n million. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.\nOther\nSome of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur. These contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes, increased lender capital costs and other similar costs. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business. There are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these indemnification clauses. We have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and, under current circumstances, we do not believe an indemnification in any material amount is probable.\nIf any person acquires ownership of more than \n50\n% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any \n24\n-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms. Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than \n50\n% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. If this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations.\nAt December 31, 2024, we have future commitments to pay for our usage of certain port facilities, marine consumables, services and maintenance contracts as follows (in millions):\nYear\n2025\n$\n178\n \n2026\n188\n \n2027\n167\n \n2028\n124\n \n2029\n118\n \nThereafter\n797\n \n$\n1,572\n \nF-44"
