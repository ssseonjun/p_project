  "item1_summary": " Our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a significant customer or supplier . The healthcare industry continues to experience increasing consolidation, including through the formation of strategic alliances among pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies, healthcare providers and health insurers . Volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions including elevated interest rates, changes in customer payment terms, and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency of our customers .\n As of September 30, 2025, our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 38% and 5% of our accounts receivable, net . The bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us, including our largest customer, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows .\n Declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position . Disruption and volatility could increase our costs of borrowing, impair our liquidity, or adversely impact our business . Liabilities related to litigation or any significant related settlement, an increase in our debt or a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings .\n The healthcare industry in the U.S., as well as in the other countries and regions in which we do business, is highly regulated at many levels of government . Declining economic conditions or increases in inflation may also increase our costs . Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flows from operations .\n In recent years, some governments have passed or proposed laws and regulations intended to protect the safety and security of the supply chain . The FDA issued a proposed rule on February 4, 2022, which, when finalized, will establish national standards for the licensure of wholesale drug distributors and third-party logistics providers . Failure to comply with the DQSA requirements may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our facilities into compliance .\n Pedigree tracking laws increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs . EU member states have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations aimed at mitigating or controlling drug supply shortages . Non-compliance could result in fines, product seizures, operating restrictions, litigation, reputational harm, and loss of market access .\n Failure or delays in compliance by us, manufacturers, or others in our supply chain with the DQSA and DSCSA requirements, could increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations . Recent limitations on COVID-19 vaccinations and changes to pediatric vaccination schedules may have an adverse impact on the  availability or access to certain products that we distribute .\n Any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing or reimbursement, such as pricing controls or indexing models at a national, federal or state level, could adversely affect our operations . In the EU, many governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels in order to control government healthcare system costs .\n The Affordable Care Act included numerous reforms broadening healthcare access and changing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, pricing, and contracting for prescription drugs . We cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the ACA or that of any other healthcare legislation and regulation . Federal government and state governments could take actions that impact Medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs .\n Medicare Part D benefit redesign, including replacement of “coverage gap discounts” Manufacturer inflation rebates on drugs covered under Medicare Part B and Part D, to the extent such products’ prices increase faster than the rate of consumer price inflation . CMS has proposed a mechanism under which manufacturers would issue rebates or credits to effectuate maximum fair prices to pharmaceutical purchasers .\n Manufacturers are required to choose their methodology for price access compliance by December 2, 2025 for the first year of maximum fair pricing implementation starting January 1, 2026 . At least eight federal lawsuits have been filed by manufacturers seeking to invalidate the negotiated drug pricing features of the IRA . The uncertainties associated with this litigation may create disruption with respect to both implementation of the law and pricing practices .\n Federal agency rules governing reimbursement and pricing programs may impact our business . In November 2023, CMS finalized a retrospective refund rule that provides for lump-sum refund payments totaling approximately $9 billion to be made to affected 340B hospitals . CMS also finalized a separate rule in October 2025 which may affect the manner in which manufacturers calculate the average sales price (ASP) for their drugs .\n Changes could result in reduced Part B payments for specialty products to our customers . Manufacturers may seek to implement alternative pricing or contracting structures for their service fee relationships with wholesalers, providers, and other entities . There can be no assurance that such outcomes will not have an adverse impact on our business (especially the practice management and physician specialty network organizations that we have recently invested in or acquired).\n HRSA and the federal government are no longer challenging these manufacturers’ policies . A number of states have enacted legislation that would restrict such policies, and these new laws are the subject of ongoing litigation by manufacturers . While wholesale distributors are not parties to these proceedings, it is possible that either manufacturers or covered entities may seek data relating to underlying claims, which could indirectly increase our operational costs .\n On August 1, 2025, the U.S. federal government announced that it would consider applications for a limited 340B rebate model on a demonstration basis, available solely for drugs that are subject to “negotiated pricing” under Medicare beginning in 2026 . The government has prevailed in all of these challenges in the lower courts, which have held that the agency has discretion to approve or disapprove rebate models .\n Federal and state governments may adopt policies affecting drug pricing and contracting practices outside of the context of federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid . If such programs were to proliferate, they have the potential to create significant channel disruption, with manufacturers seeking tighter controls for product access at the state level to ensure availability within each state .\n If we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations . The U.S. federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs . Many states have enacted similar statutes, not necessarily limited to items and services for which payment is made by federa .\n Our business, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by legal proceedings . If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries, we could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties . The Company’s Board of Directors and/or management team may also be the subject of derivative litigation .\n The defense and resolution of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows . Litigation is costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to ordinary business operations . Violations of various laws, including with respect to the marketing, sale, purchase, and dispensing of pharmaceutical products, can result in criminal, civil, and administrative liability .\n The Distributor Settlement Agreement, which we and the other two national pharmaceutical distributors negotiated to resolve a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local government entities, became effective on April 2, 2022 . As of September 30, 2025, it included 48 of 49 eligible states (the “Settling States”) as well as 99% by population of the eligible political subdivisions in the Settling States .\n $416.0 million will be paid prior to September 30, 2026, which is recorded in Accrued Expenses and Other on our Consolidated Balance Sheet . The remaining long-term liability of $3.9 billion is recorded . The amount of ultimate loss may differ from the amount accrued to date . We are unable to estimate the range of possible loss associated with the matters not included in the accrual .\n Federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of us . A significant number of lawsuits have been filed against us, other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, and others in the pharmaceutical supply chain . These lawsuits allege that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances . We are deeply committed to diversion control efforts, have sophisticated systems to identify orders placed warranting orders .\n The Distributor Settlement Agreement includes injunctive relief terms relating to distributors’ controlled substance anti-diversion programs . A monitor is overseeing compliance with these provisions for a period of five years . The distributors have engaged a third-party vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting, which the distributors will fund for ten years .\n Ongoing publicity regarding the abuse or misuse of prescription pain medications and the role of wholesale distributors in the supply chain could continue to have a material adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations . We are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments, and various foreign jurisdictions . There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected .\n There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge . Violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and/or international trade laws that we are subject to could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations .\n We have business operations in many countries worldwide that could give rise to potential violations of, and liabilities in connection with, applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and/or international trade law . An adverse outcome under any such investigation could subject us to fines or other penalties . Failure to adequately protect proprietary business information could result in claims of liability against us .\n Global privacy, cybersecurity, data protection and AI-related laws, regulations, and best practices are evolving, extensive, and complex . Compliance with these laws and regulations is challenging and costly. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the U.S. and beyond that regulate the collection, storage, use, security, processing, and transfer of personal data .\n A threat actor who is able to compromise the security measures of our networks and systems could misappropriate either proprietary business information or the personal data of our customers, patients, or personnel . We also have contractual obligations to our customers related to the protection of personal data and compliance with privacy and cybersecurity laws . We may also face audits or investigations by domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations .\n U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations applicable to AI continue to increase . Any cyber incident affecting our third-party business partners could significantly disrupt our operations . We have an AI policy in place, but the complicated and changing nature of AI technology increases compliance costs . Non-compliance may be subject to fines .\n Any cyber incident affecting our third-party business partners could disrupt our operations . Any actual or perceived failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations . Negative claims or publicity, including on social media, could adversely affect our reputation and business . Our reputation may also depend on the success of our corporate responsibility initiatives that require Company-wide coordination .\n Any action or inaction by us with respect to corporate responsibility initiatives may be perceived negatively by some stakeholders . The regulatory landscape surrounding corporate responsibility matters continues to evolve and remains uncertain . All of the foregoing could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks, as well as litigation, audits, investigations, or adverse stakeholder action .\n We may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization . We might initiate costly and time-consuming litigation or other proceedings to protect our trade secrets . The laws of some non-U.S. jurisdictions, particularly those of certain emerging markets, may provide less protection for our proprietary rights . As we expand our services in various markets, we may not be able to secure intellectual property protection in some markets .\n Our goodwill or long-lived assets may become impaired, which may require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles . Civil unrest, sanctions, tariffs or other trade restrictions, and trade wars can disrupt operations for us, our suppliers, our service providers, and our customers . We might suspend operations, implement extraordinary procedures, incur increased costs, or seek alternate sources for product supply .\n The testing required by GAAP involves estimates and judgments by management . Any such charge could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations . Exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose their preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees .\n The choice of forum provisions may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder’s ability to bring claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or our directors, officers or other employees . The exclusive forum provisions in our Bylaws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws .\n Cybersecurity risk management is integral to our enterprise risk management strategy . Any cyber incident affecting us and/or our third-party business partners could significantly disrupt our operations . The emergence of artificial intelligence has provided additional tools for those who perpetrate these attacks, including through social engineering, the development of customized malware, and an enhanced ability to evade detection .\n Our information security program is based upon, informed by, and responsive to industry best practice frameworks such as HITRUST CSF and ISO 27001 . Our program undergoes an internal annual review that is conducted by our CISO, as well as an external review . We leverage a diverse array of internal and external assessors, consultants, auditors, and other third parties to identify opportunities for improvements .\n loped a Cybersecurity Incident Response Process (the ‘Response Process’), which sets forth a framework for the actions to be taken in response to a cybersecurity incident and includes appropriate escalations to the Company’s senior management, including our ECCRT (as defined below), and the Board . The Response Process is routinely evaluated, tested and updated as appropriate .\n There is no guarantee that future cybersecurity incidents will not have a material impact . Despite our comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, we may not be able to prevent or mitigate a cybersecurity incident that could materially impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition . While we hold cybersecurity insurance, the expenses associated with cybersecurity threats or disruptions might not be completely covered by our policy ."
