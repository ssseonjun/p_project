  "item1_summary": " EBITDA is our net income before interest income or expense, net, other expense or income, net . We further adjust EBITda for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business . The non-GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies .\n Non-GAAP measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity, as an alternative to net income, or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP . The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA is net income divided by revenue .\n We have spent more than 30 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses . Net income has included significant charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, and loss on debt extinguishment . We believe the disclosure of non-GAAP measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter-to-quarter and from year to year without the impact of these items .\n Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry . The company does not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure . The amount of interest income or income, net and other expense, net we generate and incur may be useful for investors to consider .\n The amount of loss on our debt extinguishment may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents losses from the early extinguishment of debt . However, we do not consider the amount of interest income or expense, net and other expense or income, net to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business .\n The amount of settlement and impairment costs incurred outside of our ordinary course of business may be useful for investors to consider . Such costs generally represent professional service fees and direct expenses related to acquisitions . We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure . Management compensates for the above-described limitations by using a non-GAAP measure only to supplement our GAAP results .\n The following table provides our revenues by type of service (in millions and as a percentage of total revenue):Revenues$2,736.2  (1) (1)(2)) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (22) (23) (24) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (25) (32) (33) (34) (38) (36) (40) (48) (39) (50) (52) (54) (53) (62)\n The following table provides a comparison of our selected consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions) Revenues increased $281 million, or 11%, to $2.7 billion . The increase in our revenues included:  an increase in Multifamily revenues of $153 million, due to an increase in the number of properties listed on our network and increases in pricing for existing customers .\n LoopNet revenues increased $17 million, or 6%, due to increase in average price per listing and increase in number of paid listings . Revenues of the Land.com Network increased 118%, or 118%, to $2.2 billion in 2024 . Cost of revenues increased 14% to $559 million and, as a percentage of revenues, was consistent at 20%.\n Software development expenses increased 22% to $325 million . General and administrative expenses increased $58 million, or 15%, to $439 million . As a percentage of revenues, expenses increased from 11% to 12% . Customer base amortization expense was consistent at 16%, interest income, net was consistent . Costs related to acquisition activities and costs to defend our intellectual property increased .\n In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and related to leasing operations acquired in February 2024, income tax expense decreased $55 million, or 44%, to $71 million and the effective tax rate was 34% of income before income taxes . EBITDA is used by management to internally measure operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of our operating segments .\n North America revenues increased $234 million, or 11%, to $2.6 billion and included:  increased multifamily revenues of $153 million . Revenues from the Land.com Network increased $15 million,  34%, due to the launch of the new Homes.com membership subscriptions, partially offset by the discontinuation of certain products and services that were inconsistent with our long-term business strategy .\n North America EBITDA decreased to $181.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $403 million in 2023 . Information services revenues of $18 million, or 46%, attributable to converting legacy STR customers to our new CoStar-based benchmarking product . The decrease was primarily due to increases in marketing costs, personnel costs, professional services fees, and web hosting costs .\n Future interest payments associated with the Senior Notes are $168.0 million, with $28.0M payable within 12 months . We are expanding our Richmond, Virginia campus, which is expected to result in a material cash requirement in 2025 and 2026 . Services acquired under these agreements primarily relate to web hosting, sponsorship agreements, third-party data or listings, and software subscriptions .\n The value of the allowance to use a market-based income apportionment for income taxes is dependent on our taxable income . Failure to meet these targets could result in a reduction of the tax incentives and repayment of previous tax reductions . Each share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First Merger (the “First Effective Time”) will be converted into a number of CoStar Group Shares .\n Matterport and CoStar Group expect the merger to be completed in the first quarter of 2025 . Consummation of the Mergers is not subject to approval by our stockholders or to any financing condition . Each party’s obligation to consummate the merger is subject to certain other conditions, including accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party .\n The Company intends to fund the cash consideration with cash on hand . The stock consideration would require the issuance of approximately 11.2 million CoStar Group Shares using the share price of the Company at April 19, 2024, not considering Fractional Share Consideration . The Board of Directors approved the Stock Repurchase Program which authorizes, but does not obligate, the repurchase of up to $500 million .\n The company's cash and cash equivalents decreased to $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2024 . The decrease in cash was primarily due to $912.9 million of cash used in investing activities and $13.7 million in financing activities . The change was primarily driven by an increase in the purchase of property, equipment, and other assets for our new campuses of $461.5 million .\n The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures . We review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary . The accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors, including the factors listed below .\n Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on October 1 of each year . Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination and is calculated as the excess of purchase consideration paid over the fair value of assets of the net identifiable assets acquired .\n Assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies and determined by management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model . The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit . If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference .\n The functional currency for a majority of our operations is the local currency, with the exception of certain international locations for which the functional currency is the British Pound . The carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable . For an in-depth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Report .\n As of December 31, 2024, we had $4.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents . Fluctuations in the exchange rates of revenues denominated in any other foreign currencies would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated results . We currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries .\n We had approximately $3.0 billion of goodwill and intangible assets as of December 31, 2024 . We believe our intangible assets will be recoverable; however, changes in the economy, the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability . We would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset .\n As of December 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year . We continue to implement a financial system that is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operational and financial accounting processes .
