    "item1": "ITEM 1.    Business\nThe Broadridge Business\nBroadridge, a Delaware corporation, is a global financial technology leader powering investing, corporate governance, and communications.\n \nWe deliver technology-driven solutions to banks, broker-dealers, asset and wealth managers, public companies, investors, and mutual funds, that enable our clients to operate, innovate and grow. Our trusted expertise and transformative technology solutions help financial services companies enhance investor engagement, optimize trading and investing, and digitize communications.\nWe operate our business in two reportable segments: Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations.\nInvestor Communication Solutions\nOur Regulatory Solutions, Data-Driven Fund Solutions, Corporate Issuer Solutions, and Customer Communications Solutions are provided as part of the Investor Communication Solutions segment. The Investor Communication Solutions segment is the larger of our two business segments and its revenues represented approximately 74% and 75% of our total Revenues in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, including the foreign exchange impact from revenues generated in currencies other than the United States of America (“U.S.”) dollar. See “Analysis of Reportable Segments — Revenues” under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We provide the following services and solutions through our Investor Communication Solutions segment:\nRegulatory Solutions \n \nWe handle the entire proxy materials distribution and voting process for our bank, broker-dealer, corporate issuer and fund clients. We offer electronic and traditional hard copy services for the delivery of proxy materials to investors and collection of consents; maintenance of a rules engine and database that contains the delivery method preferences of our clients’ customers; posting of documents on their websites; email notification to investors alerting them that proxy materials are available; and proxy voting via telephone, online, mobile, or paper. We have the ability to combine shareholder communications for multiple stockholders residing at the same address. We also offer proxy vote solicitation services for the registered clients of fund companies, efficiently managing the entire proxy campaign. \nIn addition, we provide a complete outsourced solution for the processing of all international institutional and retail proxies, including shareholder disclosure management.\nA majority of publicly-traded shares are not registered in companies’ records in the names of their ultimate beneficial owners. Instead, a substantial majority of all public companies’ shares are held in “street name, meaning that they are held of record by broker-dealers or banks through their depositories. Most street name shares are registered in the name “Cede & Co.” the name used by The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTC”), which holds shares on behalf of its participant broker-dealers and banks. These participant broker-dealers and banks (which are known as “Nominees” because they hold securities in name only) in turn hold the shares on behalf of their customers, the individual beneficial owners. Nominees, upon request, are required to provide companies with the information of beneficial owners who do not object to having their names, addresses, and shareholdings supplied to companies, so called “non-objecting beneficial owners” (or “NOBOs”). Objecting beneficial owners (or “OBOs”) may be contacted directly only by the broker-dealer or bank. As DTC’s role is only as the custodian, a number of mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights DTC holds as the record owner (such as the right to vote) to the beneficial owners. The first step in passing voting rights down the chain is the “omnibus proxy,” which DTC executes to transfer its voting rights to its participant Nominees. Under applicable rules, Nominees must deliver proxy materials to beneficial owners and request voting instructions.\n4\nGiven the large number of Nominees involved in the beneficial proxy process resulting from the large number of beneficial shareholders, we play a unique, central, and integral role in ensuring that the beneficial proxy process occurs without issue for Nominees, companies, funds, and investors. A large number of Nominees have contracted out the processes of distributing proxy materials and tabulating voting instructions to us. Nominees accomplish this by entering into agreements with Broadridge and transferring to us, via powers of attorney, the authority to execute a proxy, which authority the Nominee receives from DTC via an omnibus proxy. Through our agreements with Nominees for the provision of beneficial proxy services, we take on the responsibility of ensuring that the account holders of Nominees receive proxy materials on a timely basis digitally or in print, that their voting instructions are conveyed to the companies and funds conducting solicitations and that these services are fulfilled in accordance with the requirements of their particular solicitation. In order for us to provide the beneficial proxy services effectively, we interface and coordinate directly with each company and/or fund to ensure that the services are performed in an accurate and timely manner. As it would increase the costs for companies and funds to work with the Nominees through which their shares are held beneficially on an individual basis, companies and funds work with us for the performance of the tasks and processes necessary to ensure that proxy materials are distributed on a timely basis to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported.\nThe SEC’s rules require public companies to reimburse Nominees for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners of securities held in street name. The reimbursement rates are set forth in the rules of self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), including the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). We bill public companies for the proxy services performed, collect the fees, and remit to the Nominee its portion of the fees. In addition, the NYSE rules establish fees for certain services provided by intermediaries, such as Broadridge, in the proxy process. The preparation and delivery of NOBO information is subject to reimbursement by the corporate issuers requesting the information. The reimbursement rates are based on the number of NOBOs produced pursuant to NYSE or other SRO rules. The rules also determine the fees to be paid to third-party intermediaries, such as Broadridge, who compile the NOBO information on behalf of Nominees who need to respond to corporate issuer requests for NOBO information.\nWe provide institutional investors with a suite of services to manage and track the entire proxy voting process, including meeting their reporting needs. ProxyEdge\n® \n(“ProxyEdge”) is our innovative electronic proxy delivery and voting solution for institutional investors and financial advisors that integrates ballots for positions held across multiple custodians and presents them under a single proxy. Voting can be instructed for the entire position, by account vote group, or on an individual account basis either manually or automatically based on the recommendations of participating governance research providers. ProxyEdge also provides for client reporting and regulatory reporting. ProxyEdge can be utilized for meetings of U.S. and Canadian companies and for meetings in many non-North American countries based on the holdings of our global custodian clients. ProxyEdge is offered in several languages and there are currently over 7,000 ProxyEdge users worldwide.\nIn addition to our proxy services, we provide regulatory communications solutions that enable global asset managers to communicate with large audiences of investors efficiently and reliably by centralizing all investor communications through one resource. We provide composition, printing, filing, and distribution services for regulatory reports, prospectuses, and proxy materials, as well as mutual fund proxy solicitation services. We manage the entire communications process with both registered and beneficial stockholders and provide a complete platform for creating and distributing regulatory investor communications across multiple channels, including e-delivery, online, mobile, and print. These services include prospectus delivery and an end-to-end solution to fund administrators and asset managers for composing, filing, and distributing tailored annual and semi-annual shareholder reports, known as Tailored Shareholder Reports, that are ADA-compliant and have embedded XBRL.\nThrough our Fund Communication Solutions business, we provide fund managers with a single, integrated provider to manage data, perform calculations, compose documents, manage regulatory compliance, and disseminate information across multiple jurisdictions. Our solutions help fund managers increase distribution opportunities, comply with both United Kingdom and European Union regulations such as Solvency II and MiFID II, and make information easily accessible for investors in a digital format. We also provide support to fund managers with document and data dissemination in the UK and European markets, enabling the receipt by distributors and investors of information supporting fund sales.\nOur Pass-Through Voting solution supports fund clients in providing individual investors the ability to participate in the proxy voting process, helping them to expand their investor engagement efforts and receive valuable input for important investment decisions. Our solution for institutional investors helps asset managers split the vote in portfolio companies and pass the ability to vote directly to institutional investors on a proportional basis. For retail investors, our solutions allow funds to poll their investors on voting preferences and provide investors the ability to give voting instructions, set standard voting preferences, or cast a vote at pre-determined meetings. \n5\nIn addition to our fund solutions, we also provide a range of other regulatory communications solutions, including reorganization communications notifying investors of U.S. reorganizations or corporate action events, such as tender offers, mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies, and global class action services for the identification, filing and recovery of class actions and collective redress proceedings involving securities and other financial products.\nWe also provide international corporate governance solutions addressing our clients’ needs within Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) region. \nThese solutions include institutional and retail global proxy services, and shareholder disclosure management and analytics for both financial intermediaries and corporate issuers. \nOur international solutions help clients focus on their core businesses while helping them maintain global and local regulatory compliance, reduce costs, improve efficiency and gain data insights.\nData-Driven Fund Solutions\nWe provide a full range of data-driven solutions that help our asset management and retirement service provider clients grow revenue, operate efficiently, and maintain compliance. Our data and analytics solutions provide investment product distribution data, predictive modeling, analytical tools, and insights and research to enable asset managers to optimize product distribution across retail and institutional channels globally. We also provide fiduciary-focused learning and development, software and technology, and data and analytics services to advisors, institutions and asset managers across the retirement and wealth ecosystem.\n \nThrough our Retirement and Workplace Solutions business (“Broadridge Retirement and Workplace”), we provide automated mutual fund and exchange-traded funds trade processing services for financial institutions that submit trades on behalf of their clients, including qualified and non-qualified retirement plans and individual wealth accounts.\n \nOur trust, trading and settlement services are integrated into our product suite, strengthening our role as a provider of insight, technology, and business process outsourcing to the asset management, wealth, and retirement industry. In addition, our marketing and transactional communications solutions provide a content management and omni-channel distribution platform for marketing and sales communications for asset managers, insurance providers and retirement service providers. \nCorporate Issuer Solutions \n \nWe provide a range of corporate issuer solutions that revolve around shareholder meetings and proxy, corporate governance and sustainability, regulatory filings and disclosure, and stock transfer services.

We also provide abandoned property compliance and reporting services.\nCustomer Communications Solutions \n \nWe support financial services, healthcare, insurance, consumer finance, telecommunications, utilities, and other service industries with omni-channel customer communications management strategies for their transactional communications, including statements and bills, marketing communications, such as personalized microsites and campaigns, and regulatory communications, such as trade confirmations and explanations of benefits. \nThese services include digital and physical delivery of critical communications. Our physical delivery services operate through a network of seven highly automated facilities across North America. The Broadridge Communications Cloud\nSM\n is an omni-channel platform (the “Communications Cloud”) that provides our clients the flexibility to implement only the modules and delivery channels needed to address their specific communication needs. The platform’s open application programming interfaces and self-servicing tools help our clients improve their communications systems’ efficiency and productivity. Through the Communications Cloud, our clients can:\n•\ndevelop transactional, regulatory, and marketing communications with relevant, self-service content that drives customer action;\n•\ndeliver customer communications across print, digital, email, short message service (“SMS”) and emerging channels, such as interactive microsites, with one connection; and\n•\ngain comprehensive reporting and analytics to improve communications and increase engagement based on customer behaviors.\nGlobal Technology and Operations\nTransactions involving securities and other financial market instruments can, for example, originate with an institutional or retail investor who places an order with a broker who in turn routes that order to an appropriate market for execution. At that point, the parties to the transaction coordinate payment and settlement of the transaction through a clearinghouse. The records of the parties involved must then be updated to reflect completion of the transaction. The transaction must comply with tax, custody, accounting, and record-keeping requirements, and the customer’s account information must correctly reflect the transaction. The accurate processing of trading activity from its initial inception and custody activity requires effective automation and information flow across multiple systems and functions within the firm and across the systems of the various parties that participate in the execution of a transaction. \nOur Global Technology and Operations business provides mission-critical, scale infrastructure to the global financial markets. As a leading software as a service (“SaaS”) provider, we offer capital markets and wealth and investment management firms modern technology to enable growth, simplify their technology stacks, and mutualize costs.\n \nOur highly scalable, resilient, component-based platform automates the front-to-back transaction lifecycle of equity, mutual fund, fixed income, foreign exchange and exchange-traded derivatives, from order capture and execution through trade confirmation, margin, cash management, clearing and settlement, reference data management, reconciliations, securities financing and collateral management, asset servicing, compliance and regulatory reporting, portfolio accounting and custody-related services. Our Wealth Management business provides solutions for advisors and investors and streamlines back- and middle-office operations for broker-dealers by providing systems for critical post-trade activities, including books and records, transaction processing, clearance and settlement, and reporting.\n \nOur Investment Management business provides portfolio and order management solutions for traditional and alternative asset managers, which bring insights into trading, portfolio construction, risk, and analytics.

See “Analysis of Reportable Segments — Revenues” under “Item 7.

Our solutions harness people, technology, and insights to help transform our clients’ businesses by enriching customer engagement, navigating risk, optimizing efficiency, and growing revenue.\nAs financial institutions look to transform and mutualize their mission-critical but non-differentiating operational and support functions, we have the proven technology, scale, innovation, experience and, most importantly, the network to achieve this goal and meet their needs.\n \nOur strategy addresses critical industry needs by utilizing our leading platform capabilities. Specifically, our growth strategy is focused on three key themes: (i) driving democratization and digitization in governance, (ii) simplifying and innovating trading in capital markets, and (iii) modernizing wealth and investment management.\nOur business model\nWe deliver multi-client technology and business process outsourcing services primarily through common SaaS-based operations platforms. We create layers of value for clients by harnessing network benefits, providing deep data and analytics, and offering a comprehensive suite of digital capabilities all on a single platform that enables deeper integration, streamlined onboarding, and better data access. Our SaaS offerings allow our clients to mutualize key functions and thereby reduce their costs. All of this translates into our core value proposition, to be a trusted provider of technology and services across a range of analytical, operational, and reporting functions.\nStrong positions in a large and growing financial services market\nOur technology and associates power the critical infrastructure and services behind investing, investment governance, and investor communications. We make our clients stronger, and through them, we enable better financial lives for investors around the globe. Our deep industry knowledge enables our clients to successfully solve complex technological and operational challenges, while adapting to the latest technology trends, market structure changes, and regulatory standards. While financial services firms have historically kept much of their technology infrastructure work in-house, there are significant trends working in our favor. Specifically, financial services firms globally are spending more on technology, and the budgets allocated for such technology are consistently growing year-over-year. Moreover, these firms are devoting a growing percentage of this spend to third-party technology, operations, and services. As a trusted outside service provider, we can streamline and better integrate our clients’ infrastructure and business processes. We expect the efficiencies that result from such undertakings by Broadridge will lead to growth in the market for our solutions.\nThree attractive growth themes\nOur growth themes address mission-critical client needs as described below. Through our integrated solutions and scalable infrastructure, we believe we are best positioned to address them.\n•\nGovernance\n. We operate an extensive industry network through our governance platform that links broker-dealers, public companies, mutual funds, shareholders, and regulators. Through our platform, we continue to grow our governance solutions by transforming content and delivery and improving e-product capabilities to drive higher investor engagement. We aim to be an integral partner to broker-dealers, asset managers, and retirement service providers by offering data-driven solutions that help them grow revenue, reduce costs, and maintain compliance. We are also helping to simplify the governance process for public companies, offering an expanding suite of capabilities that allows them to better navigate the complexity of reaching shareholders. We continue to be a leading provider of investor communications, and are at the forefront of delivering richer communication experiences, both digitally and through optimized print and mail services.\n9\n•\nCapital Markets. \nGlobal institutions have a strong need to simplify their complex technology environment, and our SaaS-based, global, multi-asset-class technology platforms address this need. As a leader in global trade lifecycle management, we are driving next-generation solutions that simplify our clients’ operations, improve performance and resiliency, evolve to global operating models, adapt to new technologies, and enable our clients to better manage their data. Our acquisition of Itiviti Holding AB, now operating as Broadridge Trading and Connectivity Solutions, for example, expanded our services across the trade lifecycle for equities and exchange-traded derivatives and grew our international reach. We continue to leverage emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI to deliver innovative solutions to our clients.  Our blockchain-enabled Distributed Ledger Repo (“DLR”) platform combines distributed ledger technology with existing market settlement infrastructure to provide clients added flexibility to manage their liquidity needs and execute cross-border intraday repo transactions through our DLR network.  In addition, we have introduced a number of AI-driven solutions such as BondGPT and OpsGPT with agentic capabilities while continuing to develop new AI applications to create a more efficient trading process for our clients. We also continue to develop component solutions that meet the regulatory, risk, data, and analytics needs of our clients, while also helping to drive more efficient liquidity, price discovery, and improved execution for the firms we serve. We plan to continue building on our global platform capabilities, enabling our clients to simplify and improve their global operations across cash, equity securities, and other asset classes.\n•\nWealth and Investment Management. \nWealth and investment management clients, including full-service, regional and independent broker-dealers, investment advisors, insurance companies, and retirement solutions providers are all undergoing unprecedented change. These firms are in need of partners to help them navigate the demographic shift of advisors and investors, create more engaging client experiences, and deliver operational technologies that are essential to their business. These market dynamics are driving the need for more seamlessly integrated technology, as well as data-centric digital wealth and investment management solutions that better service advisors and investors. This can be achieved by simplifying and modernizing their complicated and interwoven legacy systems. To address these demands, we have developed a holistic wealth management platform solution that provides seamless systems and data integration capabilities. Our platform enables firms to improve advisor productivity, provide a more personalized investor experience, and realize operational process efficiencies. Our acquisition of Kyndryl’s Securities Industry Services (“SIS”) business in 2024 has further bolstered our Wealth offerings in Canada by integrating advanced clearing and settlement, account record-keeping, and tax and regulatory reporting capabilities directly into our platform. Our solutions also reduce complexity and capitalize on emerging technology to simplify operations across the trade lifecycle for hedge fund, private asset, and complex asset managers and their asset servicers.\nAcross our growth themes, we continue to expand our global footprint, driving international growth through both strategic investments and organic initiatives. These efforts reinforce our commitment to delivering scalable solutions to a growing and diverse global client base.\nOn-ramp for next-generation technologies\nAcross financial services, the pace of change is only accelerating. Our clients understand that next-generation technology is a key driving force for change and efficiency and that there is a need among our client base to leverage this technology to address their critical business challenges. However, our clients face obstacles in making the necessary investments and, more importantly, in applying the right talent and intellectual capital, which may be focused on their most differentiating functions. This continues to create a differentiated ability for us to support our clients in the areas where we have scale and domain expertise, which includes areas such as AI, blockchain, cloud, digital, and other new technologies. By leveraging our services, firms can benefit from highly skilled, experienced personnel with deep industry expertise, while mutualizing the costs and risks of technology innovation. We approach innovation through three actions: experimenting, partnering, and engaging. In turn, we help our clients stay on the cutting edge and realize the benefits of digital transformation at a quicker pace.\nHigh engagement and client-centric culture\nBroadridge is client-centric and has created and grown multi-entity infrastructures across a variety of functions with high client satisfaction. We conduct a client satisfaction survey for each of our major business units annually, the results of which are a component of all our associates’ compensation because of the importance of client retention to the achievement of our revenue goals.\nWe have built a talent network of engaged and knowledgeable associates dedicated to serving clients well, which in turn creates a real and sustainable advantage for our business. Supporting excellent client delivery takes engaged associates, and we are passionate about creating an environment in which every associate can thrive and build their knowledge and skills. All of this creates a culture that benefits our associates, our clients, and our stockholders.\n10\nClients\nWe serve a large and diverse client base including banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds, retirement service providers, corporate issuers, and wealth and asset management firms. Our clients in the financial services industry include retail and institutional brokerage firms, global banks, mutual funds, asset managers, insurance companies, annuity companies, institutional investors, specialty trading firms, clearing firms, third-party administrators, hedge funds, and financial advisors. Our corporate issuer clients are typically publicly held companies. In addition to financial services firms, we service corporate clients in healthcare, insurance, consumer finance, telecommunications, utilities, and other service industries, supporting their essential communications. We embrace the concept of the Service-Profit Chain, which directly connects employee engagement, client satisfaction, and the creation of shareholder value. \nIn fiscal year 2025, we:    \n•\nmanaged proxy voting for over 900 million equity proxy positions;\n•\nprocessed over 7 billion investor and customer communications through print and digital channels;\n•\nprocessed on average over $15 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day;\n•\nprovided fixed income trade processing services to 21 of the 25 primary dealers of fixed income securities in the U.S.; and\n•\nprovided services to the 15 largest U.S. wealth providers.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Our Investor Communication Solutions business competes with companies that provide investor communication and corporate governance solutions, as well as our clients’ in-house operations. This includes independent proxy distribution service providers, transfer agents, proxy advisory firms, proxy solicitation firms, firms that process proxy votes, and financial printers. We also face competition from numerous firms in the compiling, printing and electronic distribution of statements, bills and other customer communications. Within our Global Technology and Operations business, our capital markets solutions compete with in-house operations as well as vendors that provide trade processing, back-office record keeping, and sell-side order and execution management systems. Similarly, our wealth management solutions compete with service providers that deliver data, technology solutions, and marketing services to be used by wealth advisors. Finally, our investment management solutions compete with firms that provide portfolio management, compliance, and operational support solutions for asset managers and hedge funds.\nTechnology\nWe provide products and platforms to the financial services industry and have several information processing systems that serve as the core foundation of our technology platform. We are committed to maintaining high levels of quality service through our skilled technical employees and the use of our technology within an environment that seeks continual improvement. \nOur technology strategy is designed to provide high levels of availability, scalability, reliability, and flexibility, leveraging a hybrid model consisting of private and public cloud services as well as traditional data center services. Our technology architecture consists of systems and applications which operate in data centers that employ multiple active power and cooling distribution paths and redundant components. Additionally, these data centers provide infrastructure capacity to permit planned activities without disruption to processing the critical load, and, as a general matter, are designed to sustain at least one worst-case, unplanned failure or event without a significant critical load impact. Our geographically dispersed processing centers also provide disaster recovery and business continuity processing capabilities. Our applications that incorporate cloud technology operate on industry standard enterprise architecture platforms providing significant opportunities for horizontal and vertical scaling. This scalability and redundancy enables us to provide high degrees of system availability for our clients. \nOur technology connects industry participants across the financial services ecosystem, forming a network that includes capital markets firms, broker-dealers, asset managers, public companies, and investors. The data derived through these connections provides value to participants and is at the heart of our approach – which leverages this data to generate insights that drive innovation, address industry-wide challenges, accelerate product development, and support decision making.\nWe conduct annual reviews with many of our clients of our cybersecurity and data security policies, practices and controls, which, together with our ongoing engagement with regulators across the world, helps us keep pace with cybersecurity and data security standards and support our product development and technology decisions. For more information on our information security program, please refer to “",
    "item1c": "ITEM 1C.   Cybersecurity \nOur information security program is designed to meet the needs of our clients who entrust us with their sensitive information. We maintain International Organization for Standardization 27001 certification for our enterprise-wide information security management system and program. Where applicable, we align to other industry standards or frameworks, including the Cloud Security Alliance’s Cloud Controls Matrix, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the CSF HiTRUST Common Security Framework.\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the importance of identifying, assessing, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats. \nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management\n (“ERM”) process which provides an ongoing procedure, effected at all levels of the Company and across business units and corporate functions, to identify and assess risk, monitor risk, and take appropriate mitigating action. Central to our risk management process is the Risk Committee, a management committee that oversees the identification and assessment of the key risks affecting our operations and reviews the controls established with respect to these risks. The Risk Committee is comprised of key members of management, including the President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, and other senior executives of the Company. \nOur Risk Committee collaborates with subject matter experts, as needed, to gather insights for identifying and assessing material cybersecurity risks, their severity, and potential mitigations\n.\nWe take the following actions, among others, to demonstrate our commitment to maintaining the highest levels of information security, provide for the availability of critical data and systems, maintain regulatory compliance, manage our material risks from cybersecurity threats, and to identify, protect against, detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents:\n•\nleverage encryption, data masking technology, data loss prevention technology, authentication technology, entitlement management, access control, network and application segmentation, anti-malware software, and transmission of data over private networks, among other systems and procedures, designed to protect against unauthorized access to information;\n•\nconduct annual reviews with many of our clients on our cybersecurity and data security policies, practices and controls, and engage with regulators across the world, to remain apprised of cybersecurity and data security standards and best practices; \n•\nutilize the National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (the “NIST Framework”) issued by the U.S. government as a guideline to manage our cybersecurity-related risk. The NIST Framework outlines security controls and outcomes over five functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover; \n•\nconduct network and endpoint monitoring, vulnerability assessments, and network penetration testing;\n•\nconduct quarterly information security management and incident training, and regular phishing email simulations for all associates to enhance awareness and responsiveness to possible threats;\n•\nrun tabletop exercises to simulate a response to a cybersecurity incident and use the findings to improve our policies and procedures;\n•\nconduct\n \ninformation security reviews and due diligence on key service providers to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks associated with our use of third-party software and services; and\n•\nmaintain global information security policies and procedures, including an incident response and crisis management plan that include processes to triage, assess, investigate, escalate, contain, and remediate cybersecurity incidents.\nWe further describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading “Security breaches or cybersecurity incidents could adversely affect our financial results and our ability to operate, could result in personal, confidential or proprietary information being misappropriated, and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation,” included as part of our risk factor disclosures at",

With respect to risk management, our CISO works closely with our Managing Director, Risk Management, and other members of our Risk Committee, who are responsible for reviewing and challenging, as necessary, the activities of our information security team. \nThe responsibilities of the Company’s Board include oversight of our risk management processes. The Board has two primary methods of oversight. The first method is the ERM process through which the Board receives regular reports from management regarding the most significant risks facing the Company. The second is through the functioning of the Board’s committees. \nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s information security program, including cybersecurity and data privacy risks and controls.\n \nOur \nCISO\n provides reports on the Company’s cybersec\nurity program to the Audit Committee, which includes all members of the \nBoard\n, on a quarterly basis. In addition, our Internal Audit function regularly audits our technology and cybersecurity programs and reports to the Audit Committee on its findings.",
