    "item1": "Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” \nThe MD&A is organized in the following sections:\n•\nBusiness Model and Growth Strategy\n•\nOverview\n•\nTrends Affecting Our Business\n•\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n•\nSegment Results\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBUSINESS MODEL AND GROWTH STRATEGY\nWe are the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America, a leading snack maker in the United States and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery.  We report our operations through three segments: (i) North America Confectionery, (ii) North America Salty Snacks and (iii) International, as discussed in \nNote 13\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur vision is to be a leading snacking powerhouse.  We aspire to be a leader in meeting consumers’ evolving snacking needs while strengthening the capabilities that drive our growth.  We are focused on four strategic imperatives to ensure the Company’s success now and in the future:\n•\nDrive Core Confection Business and Broaden Participation in Snacking\n.  We continue to be the undisputed leader in U.S. confection by taking actions to deepen our consumer connections and utilize our beloved brands to deliver meaningful innovation, while also diversifying our portfolio to capture profitable and incremental growth across the broader snacking continuum.\n◦\nOur products frequently play an important role in special moments among family and friends.  Seasons are an important part of our business model and for consumers, as they are highly anticipated, cherished times, centered around traditions.  For us, it’s an opportunity for our brands to be part of many connections during the year when family and friends gather.\n◦\nInnovation is an important lever in this variety-seeking category and we are leveraging work from our proprietary demand landscape analytical tool to shape our future innovation and make it more impactful. We are becoming more disciplined in our focus on platform innovation, which should enable sustainable growth over time and significant extensions to our core.\n◦\nTo expand our breadth in snacking and become a leading snacking powerhouse, we are focused on continuing to expand the boundaries of our core confection brands to capture new snacking occasions and increasing our exposure into new snack categories through acquisitions.\n•\nDeliver Profitable International Growth\n.  We are focused on ensuring that we efficiently allocate our resources to the areas with the highest potential for profitable growth.  We have reset our international investment strategy, while holding fast to our belief that our targeted emerging market strategy will deliver long-term, profitable growth.  The uncertain macroeconomic environment in many of these markets is expected to continue and we aim to ensure our investments in these international markets are appropriate relative to the size of the opportunity.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 22\n•\nExpand Competitive Advantage through Differentiated Capabilities\n.  In order to generate actionable insights, we must acquire, integrate, access and utilize vast sources of the right data in an effective manner.  We are working to leverage our advanced data and analytical techniques to gain a deep understanding of our consumers, our customers, our shoppers, our end-to-end supply chain, our retail environment and key economic drivers at both a macro and precision level, including digital transformation and new media models.  In addition, we are in the process of transforming our supply chain capabilities and enterprise resource planning system, which will enable employees to work more efficiently and effectively. \n•\nResponsibly Manage Our Operations to Ensure the Long-Term Sustainability of Our Business, Our Planet and Our People\n.  We are a purpose-driven company and for more than a century, our iconic brands have been built on a foundation of community investment and connections between people around the world.  We could not have achieved this without our remarkable employees who make our purpose a reality.  We believe our long-standing values make our Company a special place to work.\n◦\nWe believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success.  We utilize continuous listening surveys that are distributed throughout the year to all employees globally to hear their thoughts on the Company’s direction and their place in it.  These continuous touchpoints allow for real-time feedback and action from the Company.  These surveys are further supplemented with quarterly and informative enterprise summits and team “Ask Me Anything” meetings, which, in conjunction with the continuous listening surveys, generate stronger employee engagement with the Company’s strategy, initiatives and leadership.  \n◦\nOur diverse and inclusive culture makes the difference across all areas of the business.  Our gender representation includes women occupying many of the top positions in the Company, including Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Chief Accounting Officer and President, Salty Snacks, and approximately 50% representation across the Company.  Additionally, four of our 10 Board members are women (40% representation).  In 2024, we maintained fair and equitable pay achievements, including aggregate salary U.S. gender pay equity and aggregate U.S. salary people of color pay equity. \n◦\nWe continue to make progress on our ESG priorities and continue to elevate these ESG initiatives for a greater global impact.  Through our focus on sustainability and social impact across our value chain, we continue to improve and focus on the lives of cocoa farmers and cocoa communities, the environmental priorities of climate change and the role of packaging in our business, responsibly and sustainably sourcing the inputs to our products and increasing investments in human rights and diversity initiatives and growing diverse representation across the organization.\nOVERVIEW\nHershey is a global confectionery leader known for making more moments of goodness through chocolate, sweets, mints and other great tasting snacks.  We are the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America, a leading snack maker in the United States and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery.  \nWe market, sell and distribute our products under more than 90 brand names in \napproximately 70 countries worldwide.\nOur principal product offerings include chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products; gum and mint refreshment products and protein bars; pantry items, such as baking ingredients, toppings and beverages; and snack items such as spreads, bars, and snack bites and mixes, popcorn and pretzels.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nOn November 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of the Sour Strips brand from Actual Candy, LLC.  Sour Strips is\nan emerging sour candy brand and is available in a wide range of food distribution channels in the United States.\nOn May 31, 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain assets that provide additional manufacturing capacity from Weaver Popcorn Manufacturing, Inc. (“Weaver”), a leader in the production and co-packing of microwave popcorn and ready-to-eat popcorn, and former co-manufacturer of the Company’s \nSkinnyPop\n brand. \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 23\nTRENDS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS\nThroughout 2024, U.S. consumer behavior continued to shift and evolve, as cost fatigue and labor markets restrict income growth and constrain consumer spending and purchasing patterns.  As a result, consumer behavior related to our products has shifted.  As such, for the year ended December 31, 2024,we continued to experience a dynamic macroeconomic environment, including price volatility related to select commodities, resulting in corresponding incremental costs and gross margin pressures, and net sales and net income declines.  Despite specific actions taken to mitigate these gross margin pressures, we continue to experience overall declines in consumer demands for our products, and higher prices for direct materials used to manufacture our products were, and continue to be, the primary incremental cost to our business (see \nConsolidated Results of Operations\n included in this MD&A).  We utilize many exchange traded commodities for our business that are subject to price volatility, specifically cocoa products, which experienced a market price increase of approximately 70% throughout 2024 (see \nItem \n7A\n - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).  \nFurthermore, certain geopolitical events, specifically the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the imposition of tariffs on U.S. imports and retaliatory tariffs in response, have increased global economic and political uncertainty.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, neither the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, nor the imposition of tariffs on U.S. imports and retaliatory tariffs, had a material impact on our commodity prices or supply availability.  However, we are continuing to monitor each of these events for any significant escalation or expansion of economic or supply chain disruptions or broader inflationary costs, which may result in material adverse effects on our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our key strategic initiatives and other material cash requirements in both the short-term and in the long-term; however, we continue to evaluate and take action, as necessary, to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can operate effectively during the current economic environment.  We continue to monitor our discretionary spending across the organization (see \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n included in this MD&A).\nBased on the length and severity of the fluctuating macroeconomic environment, including price volatility for our commodities, the possibility of a recession, changes in consumer shopping and consumption behavior, and changes in geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we may experience increasing supply chain costs, higher inflation and other impacts to our business.  We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential and evolving impacts on our business, consolidated results of operations, segment results, liquidity and capital resources.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 24\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPercent Change\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023\n2023 vs 2022\nIn millions of dollars except per share amounts\nNet sales\n$\n11,202.3 \n$\n11,165.0 \n$\n10,419.3 \n0.3 \n%\n7.2 \n%\nCost of sales\n5,901.4 \n6,167.2 \n5,920.5 \n(4.3)\n%\n4.2 \n%\nGross profit\n5,300.9 \n4,997.8 \n4,498.8 \n6.1 \n%\n11.1 \n%\nGross margin\n47.3 \n%\n44.8 \n%\n43.2 \n%\nSelling, Marketing & Administrative (“SM&A”) expense\n2,373.6 \n2,436.5 \n2,236.0 \n(2.6)\n%\n9.0 \n%\nSM&A expense as a percent of net sales\n21.2 \n%\n21.8%\n21.5%\nBusiness realignment costs\n29.1 \n0.4 \n2.0 \nNM\n(77.8)\n%\nOperating profit\n2,898.2 \n2,560.9 \n2,260.8 \n13.2 \n%\n13.3 \n%\nOperating profit margin\n25.9 \n%\n22.9 \n%\n21.7 \n%\nInterest expense, net\n165.7 \n151.8 \n137.6 \n9.1 \n%\n10.3 \n%\nOther (income) expense, net\n258.6 \n237.2 \n206.1 \n9.0 \n%\n15.1 \n%\nProvision for income taxes\n252.7 \n310.1 \n272.3 \n(18.5)\n%\n13.9 \n%\nEffective income tax rate\n10.2 \n%\n14.3 \n%\n14.2 \n%\nNet income\n$\n2,221.2\n$\n1,861.8\n$\n1,644.8\n19.3 \n%\n13.2 \n%\nNet income per share—diluted\n$\n10.92\n$\n9.06\n$\n7.96\n20.5 \n%\n13.8 \n%\nNote:  Percentage changes may not compute directly as shown due to rounding of amounts presented above.\n NM = not meaningful\nNet Sales \n2024 compared with 2023 \nNet sales were $11,202.3 million in 2024 compared to $11,165.0 million in 2023, an increase of $37.3 million, or 0.3%.  The net sales increase reflects a favorable price realization of approximately 3% primarily due to higher list prices in the North America Confectionery and International segments, partially offset by declines in North America Salty Snacks. The increase was partially offset by a volume decrease of approximately 2% due to declines in the North America Confectionery and International segments, partially offset by an increase in North America Salty Snacks.  The increase was further offset by a minimal unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.  \n2023 compared with 2022 \nNet sales were $11,165.0 million in 2023 compared to $10,419.3 million in 2022, an increase of $745.7 million, or 7.2%.  The net sales increase reflects a favorable price realization of 8.3% due to higher list prices across all segments and by a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.2%.  The increase was slightly offset by a volume decrease of 1.3% due to a decrease in consumer demand primarily in everyday core U.S. confection brands.\nKey U.S. Marketplace Metrics \nFor the full year 2024, our total U.S. retail takeaway increased 0.8% in the expanded multi-outlet combined plus convenience store channels (MULO+ w/ Convenience), which includes candy, mint, gum, salty snacks and grocery items. Our U.S. candy, mint and gum (“CMG”) consumer takeaway increased 0.1% and experienced a CMG market share decline of 59 basis points.  Our Salty consumer takeaway increased 4.2% and experienced a Salty market share increase of 11 basis points.\nThe CMG consumer takeaway and market share information reflect measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our U.S. confectionery retail business.  These channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers and convenience store channels, plus Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., partial dollar, club and military \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 25\nchannels.  These metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by Circana, the Company’s market insights and analytics provider, and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin \n2024 compared with 2023 \nCost of sales were $5,901.4 million in 2024 compared to $6,167.2 million in 2023, a decrease of $265.8 million, or 4.3%.  The decrease included $637.9 million of favorable costs, driven by an incremental $563.0 million of favorable mark-to-market activity on our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years’ commodity purchases (See \nItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n for more information) and lower costs, primarily related to lower sales volume, in line with the declines in net sales noted above. The decrease was partially offset by $372.1 million of higher costs, primarily driven by higher commodity costs from cocoa, higher supply chain costs, unfavorable mix and incremental business realignment costs.\nGross margin was 47.3% in 2024 compared with 44.8% in 2023, an increase of 250 basis points.  The increase  was driven by favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impact from commodity derivative instruments, favorable price realization and volume declines.  The increase was partially offset by higher commodity costs, unfavorable product mix and increased business realignment costs.\n2023 compared with 2022 \nCost of sales were $6,167.2 million in 2023 compared with $5,920.5 million in 2022, an increase of $246.7 million, or 4.2%.  The increase included $356.2 million of unfavorable costs driven by higher supply chain costs, including higher labor costs partially offset by lower logistics costs, and unfavorable mix.  The increase was further driven by an incremental $97.7 million of unfavorable mark-to-market activity on our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years’ commodity purchases.  These increases were partially offset by $207.2 million of favorable supply chain productivity and price realization. \nGross margin was 44.8% in 2023 compared with 43.2% in 2022, an increase of 160 basis points.  The increase was driven by favorable price realization and increased supply chain productivity.  The increase was partially offset by unfavorable activity on our mark-to-market impact from commodity derivative instruments, higher supply chain costs, including higher labor costs and increased waste.  The increase was further driven by unfavorable mix and foreign exchange rates.\nSelling, Marketing and Administrative \n2024 compared with 2023 \nSelling, marketing and administrative (“SM&A”) expenses were $2,373.6 million in 2024 compared to $2,436.5 million in 2023, a decrease of $62.9 million, or 2.6%.  The decrease was driven by lower corporate expenses.  Total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses declined 0.1%% driven by North America Confectionery, significantly offset by increased spending in North America Salty Snacks.  SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, decreased approximately 3.8% in 2024 driven by lower compensation and benefit costs across segments.\n2023 compared with 2022 \nSM&A expenses were $2,436.5 million in 2023 compared to $2,236.0 million in 2022, an increase of $200.5 million, or 9.0%.  The increase was driven by increased corporate expenses.  Total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses increased 12.2% driven by North America Confectionery and North America Salty Snacks.  SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased approximately 7.5% in 2023 driven by higher compensation costs and investments in capabilities and technology across segments.\nBusiness Realignment Activities\nWe periodically undertake business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business in support of our key growth strategies.  In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded business realignment costs of $29.1 million, $0.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively.  The 2024 costs related primarily to the Advancing Agility & \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 26\nAutomation Initiative that the Board of Directors approved in February 2024.  The Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative, which is a multi-year productivity program to improve supply chain and manufacturing-related spend, optimize selling, general and administrative expenses, leverage new technology and business models to further simplify and automate processes, and generate long-term savings.  The 2023 and 2022 costs related primarily to the International Optimization Program, a program focused on optimizing our China operating model to improve our operational efficiency and provide for a strong, sustainable and simplified base going forward.  Costs associated with business realignment activities are classified in our Consolidated Statements of Income as described in \nNote 9\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOperating Profit and Operating Profit Margin \n2024 compared with 2023 \nOperating profit was $2,898.2 million in 2024 compared to $2,560.9 million in 2023, an increase of $337.3 million, or 13.2%.  The increase was predominantly due to higher gross profit and lower SM&A expenses partially offset by higher business realignment costs, as noted above.  Operating profit margin increased to 25.9% in 2024 from 22.9% in 2023 by the same factors noted above in gross margin.\n2023 compared with 2022 \nOperating profit was $2,560.9 million in 2023 compared to $2,260.8 million in 2022, an increase of $300.1 million, or 13.3%.  The increase was predominantly due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SM&A expenses, as noted above.  Operating profit margin decreased to 22.9% in 2023 from 21.7% in 2022 by the same factors noted above in gross margin.\nInterest Expense, Net \n2024 compared with 2023 \nNet interest expense was $165.7 million in 2024 compared to $151.8 million in 2023, an increase of $13.9 million, or 9.1%.  The increase was primarily due to higher short-term debt balances in 2024 compared to 2023, specifically related to outstanding commercial paper.  The increase in the expense was partially offset by a decrease in short-term foreign bank borrowings and an increase in interest income \n2023 compared with 2022 \nNet interest expense was $151.8 million in 2023 compared to $137.6 million in 2022, an increase of $14.2 million, or 10.3%.  The increase was primarily due to higher rates on short-term debt balances in 2023 versus 2022, specifically related to outstanding commercial paper borrowings, and higher rates on long-term debt balances, specifically related to the $350 million 4.25% Notes due in May 2028 and $400 million 4.50% Notes due in May 2033, each of which were issued in May 2023.  The increase in the expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net \n2024 compared with 2023 \nOther (income) expense, net totaled an expense of $258.6 million in 2024 versus an expense of $237.2 million in 2023, an increase of $21.4 million, or 9.0%.  The increase in the net expense was primarily driven by an increase of $32.8 million of higher write-downs on equity investments qualifying for tax credits in 2024 versus 2023, partially offset by a decrease of $10.6 million of lower non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.\n2023 compared with 2022 \nOther (income) expense, net totaled an expense of $237.2 million in 2023 versus an expense of $206.1 million in 2022, an increase of $31.1 million, or 15.1%.  The increase in the net expense was primarily driven by an increase of $22.2 million of higher write-downs on equity investments qualifying for tax credits in 2023 versus 2022 and an increase of $9.5 million of higher non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 27\nIncome Taxes and Effective Tax Rate \n2024 compared with 2023 \nOur effective income tax rate was 10.2% for 2024 compared with 14.3% for 2023\n.  Relative to the 21% s\ntatutory rate, the 2024 effective tax rate benefited from investment tax credits, partially offset by state taxes.  The 2023 effective rate, relative to the 21% statutory rate, benefited from investment tax credits, partially offset by state taxes.  \n2023 compared with 2022 \nOur effective income tax rate was 14.3% for 2023 compared with 14.2% for 2022.  Relative to the 21% statutory rate, the 2023 effective tax rate benefited from investment tax credits, partially offset by state taxes.  The 2022 effective rate, relative to the 21% statutory rate, benefited from investment tax credits, partially offset by state taxes. \nNet Income and Earnings Per Share-diluted\n2024 compared with 2023 \nNet income was $2,221.2 million in 2024 compared to $1,861.8 million in 2023, an increase of $359.4 million, or 19.3%.  Earnings Per Share (“EPS”)-diluted was $10.92 in 2024 compared to $9.06 in 2023, an increase of $1.86, or 20.5%.  The increase in both net income and EPS-diluted was driven primarily by higher gross profit, lower SM&A expenses and lower income taxes, partially offset by  higher business realignment costs and higher other income and expenses.  Our 2024 EPS-diluted benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our Board-approved repurchase programs.\n2023 compared with 2022\nNet income was $1,861.8 million in 2023 compared to $1,644.8 million in 2022, an increase of $217.0 million, or 13.2%.  EPS-diluted was $9.06 in 2023 compared to $7.96 in 2022, an increase of $1.1, or 13.8%.  The increase in both net income and EPS-diluted was driven primarily by higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SM&A expenses, higher income taxes, and higher other income and expenses.  Our 2023 EPS-diluted also benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our Board-approved repurchase programs.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 28\nSEGMENT RESULTS \nThe summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our three segments: North America Confectionery, North America Salty Snacks and International.  For segment reporting purposes, we use “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources.  Segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance.  These items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by our Chief Operating Decision Maker, Michele Buck, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation.  Segment income and segment income margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance.  We believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors, as they exclude the activities that are not directly attributable to our ongoing segment operations. Refer to \nNote 13\n Segment Information in our audited consolidated financial statements for reconciliations of net sales for our reportable segments to consolidated total net sales and of segment operating income to consolidated income before taxes.\nOur segment results, including a reconciliation to our consolidated results, were as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIn millions of dollars\nNet Sales:\nNorth America Confectionery\n$\n9,118.6 \n$\n9,123.1 \n$\n8,536.5 \nNorth America Salty Snacks\n1,135.7 \n1,092.7 \n1,029.4 \nInternational\n948.0 \n949.2 \n853.4 \nTotal\n$\n11,202.3 \n$\n11,165.0 \n$\n10,419.3 \nSegment Income:\nNorth America Confectionery\n$\n2,945.7 \n$\n3,117.0 \n$\n2,811.1 \nNorth America Salty Snacks\n199.4 \n158.3 \n159.9 \nInternational\n111.5 \n148.3 \n107.9 \nTotal segment income\n3,256.6 \n3,423.6 \n3,078.9 \nUnallocated corporate expense (1)\n701.2 \n800.4 \n735.5 \nUnallocated mark-to-market (gains) losses on commodity derivatives (2)\n(460.4)\n58.9 \n78.2 \nCosts associated with business realignment activities\n117.5 \n3.4 \n4.4 \nOperating profit\n2,898.3 \n2,560.9 \n2,260.8 \nInterest expense, net\n165.7 \n151.8 \n137.6 \nOther (income) expense, net\n258.6 \n237.2 \n206.2 \nIncome before income taxes\n$\n2,474.0 \n$\n2,171.9 \n$\n1,917.0 \n(1)\nIncludes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury, finance and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations, including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (d) acquisition-related costs and (e) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance. \n(2)\nNet losses (gains) on mark-to-market valuation of commodity derivative positions recognized in unallocated derivative losses (gains).

This includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, gum and refreshment products, protein bars, spreads, snack bites and mixes, as well as pantry and food service lines.  While a less significant component, this segment also includes our retail operations, including Hershey’s Chocolate World stores in Hershey, Pennsylvania; New York, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Niagara Falls (Ontario) and Singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world.

The decrease was driven by volume declines of approximately 4% driven by a decrease in everyday core U.S. confection brands.  The decrease was partially offset by a favorable price realization of approximately 4% due to price increases on certain products across our portfolio, and a minimal benefit from the 2024 acquisition of Sour Strips.  There was no impact from foreign currency exchange rates. \nOur North America Confectionery segment also includes licensing and owned retail.

The decrease was primarily driven by lower compensation and benefit costs, decreased investments in capabilities and technology, as a result of the completion of the upgrade of a new ERP system across the enterprise in 2024, and lower acquisition and integration related costs. \nUnallocated corporate expense totaled $800.4 million in 2023 as compared to $735.5 million in 2022, an increase of $64.9 million, or 8.8%.  The increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in capabilities and technology, higher compensation costs, and an increase in acquisition and integration related costs.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities.  Significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, the adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.  We generate substantial amounts of cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment, strategic acquisitions and the payment of dividends.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table is derived from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: \nIn millions of dollars\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n2,531.6\n$\n2,323.2\n$\n2,327.8\nInvesting activities\n(960.3)\n(1,198.7)\n(787.4)\nFinancing activities\n(1,296.5)\n(1,148.3)\n(1,415.7)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n54.0 \n(38.2)\n9.9 \nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n328.8 \n$\n(62.0)\n$\n134.6 \nOperating activities\nOur principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations.  Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes.  Sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns.  Generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months.  We meet these needs primarily with cash on hand, bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper. \nWe generated cash of $2.5 billion from operating activities in 2024, an increase of $208.4 million compared to $2.3 billion in 2023.  The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by the following factors:\n•\nIn the aggregate, select net working capital items, specifically, trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, generated cash of $102.2 million in 2024, compared to consuming cash of $209.0 million in 2023.  This $311.2 million fluctuation was mainly driven by a decrease in cash used by accounts receivable due to a decrease in sales of everyday core U.S. confection brands, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of vendor and supplier payments, and lower inventory levels. \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 33\n•\nTiming of income tax payments contributed to a decrease in operating cash of $17.1 million in 2024, compared to a decrease of $32.5 million in 2023.  This $15.4 million fluctuation was primarily due to the variance in actual tax expense for 2024 relative to the timing of quarterly estimated tax payments.  We paid cash of $201.8 million for income taxes during 2024, compared to $303.9 million in the same period of 2023.\n•\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the following net cash outflows:\n◦\nNet income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, write-down of equity investments, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and other charges) resulted in $92.4 million of lower cash flow in 2024 relative to 2023.\n◦\nOther assets and liabilities consumed cash of $138.2 million in 2024, compared to $100.4 million in 2023.  This $37.8 million fluctuation was primarily due to our 2023 purchase of an irrevocable group annuity contract to settle a portion of our post retirement benefit obligation, partially offset by the timing of certain prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nWe generated cash of $2.32 billion from operating activities in 2023, an increase of $4.6 million compared to $2.33 billion in 2022.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by the following factors:\n•\nIn the aggregate, select net working capital items, specifically, trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, consumed\n \ncash of $209.0 million in 2023, compared to $8.6 million in 2022.  This $200.4 million fluctuation was mainly driven by mainly driven by an increase in cash used by accounts receivable due to an increase in sales of U.S. seasonal products and the timing of vendor and supplier payments.\n•\nTiming of income tax payments contributed to a decrease in operating cash of $32.5 million in 2023, compared to an increase of $5.0 million in 2022.  This $37.5 million fluctuation was primarily due to the variance in actual tax expense for 2023 relative to the timing of quarterly estimated tax payments.  We paid cash of $303.9 million  for income taxes during 2023 compared to $221.3 million in the same period of 2022.\n•\nOther assets and liabilities consumed cash of $100.4 million in 2023, compared to $25.7 million in 2022.  This $74.7 million fluctuation was primarily due to our purchase of an irrevocable group annuity contract to settle a portion of our post retirement benefit obligation.\n•\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the following net cash inflows:\n◦\nNet income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, write-down of equity investments and other charges) resulted in $256.7 million of higher cash flow in 2023 relative to 2022.\nPension and Post-Retirement Activity.  \nWe recorded net periodic benefit costs of $32.8 million, $43.2 million and $36.3 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, relating to our benefit plans (including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans).  The main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long-term estimates, including discount rates used to value the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses.\nThe funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and the level of funding.  We contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements.  Cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled $15.6 million, $27.6 million and $78.5 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 34\nInvesting activities\nOur principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, as well as acquisitions of businesses, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.  We used cash of $960.3 million for investing activities in 2024 compared to $1.2 billion in 2023, with the decrease in cash spend driven by a decrease of investments in capabilities and technology as well as a lower level of acquisition activity.  We used cash of $0.8 billion for investing activities in 2022, with the increase in 2023 in cash spend driven by an increase of investments in capabilities and technology as well as a higher level of acquisition activity.\nPrimary investing activities include the following:\n•\nCapital spending\n.  Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, primarily to support our ERP system implementation, capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $605.9 million in 2024, $771.1 million in 2023 and $519.5 million in 2022. The decrease in our 2024 capital expenditures is largely driven by the wind down of our key strategic initiatives, including completion of the upgrade of a new ERP system across the enterprise in 2024.  We expect 2025 capital expenditures, including capitalized software, of approximately $425 million to $450 million, as capital spending as a percentage of sales is expected to return to historical levels.  We intend to use our existing cash and internally generated funds to meet our 2025 capital requirements.\n•\nInvestments in partnerships qualifying for tax credits\n.  We make investments in partnership entities that in turn make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and energy tax credits.  We invested approximately $285.5 million in 2024, $256.8 million in 2023 and $275.5 million in 2022 in projects qualifying for tax credits.\n•\nBusiness acquisitions\n.   In 2024, we spent $75.5 million to acquire the Sour Strips brand from Actual Candy, LLC (November 2024).  In 2023, we spent $165.8 million to acquire Weaver (May 2023).  In 2022, we had no acquisition activity.  Further details regarding our business acquisition activity is provided in \nNote 2\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n•\nOther investing activities\n.  In 2024, 2023, and 2022, our other investing activities were minimal. \nFinancing activities \nOur cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our Common Stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.  Financing activities in 2024 used cash of $1.3 billion, compared to cash used of $1.1 billion in 2023.  We used cash of $1.4 billion for financing activities in 2022.\nThe majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following:\n•\nShort-term borrowings, net.  \nIn addition to utilizing cash on hand, we use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs.  In 2024, our short-term borrowings increased $607.0 million predominately through the issuance of short-term commercial paper, partially offset by a decrease in short-term foreign bank borrowings.  In 2023, our short-term borrowings increased $26.0 million predominately through the issuance of short-term commercial paper, as well as an increase in short-term foreign bank borrowings.  In 2022, we used cash of $245.6 million to reduce a portion of our short-term commercial paper borrowings originally used to fund our 2021 acquisitions of Dot’s and Pretzels, partially offset by an increase in short-term foreign bank borrowings.   \n•\nLong-term debt borrowings and repayments\n.  In November 2024, we repaid $300 million of 2.050% Notes due upon maturity.  In May 2023, we repaid $250 million of 2.625% Notes and $500 million of 3.375% Notes due upon their maturities.  In May 2023, we issued $350 million of 4.250% Notes due in May 2028 and $400 million of 4.500% Notes due in May 2033 (the “2023 Notes”).  Proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, net of discounts and issuance costs, totaled $744.1 million.  In 2022, long-term debt activity was minimal.  In 2025, we expect our long-term debt repayments to approximate $600 million upon the maturity of $300 million of 0.900% Notes due in June 2025 and $300 million of 3.200% Notes due in August 2025.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 35\n•\nDividend payments\n.  Total dividend payments to holders of our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock were $1,084.8 million in 2024, $889.1 million in 2023 and $775.0 million in 2022.  Dividends per share of Common Stock increased 23.0% to $5.480 per share in 2024 compared to $4.456 per share in 2023, while dividends per share of Class B Common Stock increased 23.0% in 2024.

We repurchase shares of Common Stock to offset the dilutive impact of treasury shares issued under our equity compensation plans.  The value of these share repurchases in a given period varies based on the volume of stock options exercised and our market price.  In addition, we periodically repurchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to Board-authorized programs intended to drive additional stockholder value. Details regarding our share repurchases are as follows:\n \nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nMilton Hershey School Trust repurchase (1)(2)\n$\n— \n$\n239.9 \n$\n203.4 \nShares repurchased in the open market under pre-approved share repurchase programs (2)\n400.0 \n— \n— \nShares repurchased in the open market to replace Treasury Stock issued for stock options and incentive compensation\n$\n94.2 \n$\n25.0 \n$\n185.6 \nCash used for total share repurchases (excluding excise tax)\n$\n494.2 \n$\n264.9 \n$\n389.0 \nTotal shares repurchased under pre-approved share repurchase programs\n2.0 \n1.0 \n— \n(1) In February 2023 and 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, pursuant to which the Company purchased 1,000,000 shares in 2023 and 2022 of the Company’s Common Stock from the School Trust at a price equal to $239.91 per share, for a total purchase price of  $239.9 million in 2023.  In 2022 the Company purchased the common stock at a price equal to $203.35 per share, for a total purchase price of $203.4 million.  As a result of the 2023 share repurchase, our July 2018 share repurchase authorization program was completed.  \n(2) In July 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase authorization to repurchase shares of our Common Stock.  As a result of the February 2023 Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, the July 2018 share repurchase authorization was completed.  In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization, which was completed as of March 31, 2024.  In December 2023, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization.  This program commenced after the existing May 2021 authorization was completed and is to be utilized at management’s discretion.  Approximately $470 million remains available for repurchases under our December 2023 share repurchase authorization.  We are authorized to purchase our outstanding shares in open market and privately negotiated transactions.  The program has no expiration date and acquired shares of Common Stock will be held as treasury shares.  Purchases under approved share repurchase authorizations are in addition to our practice of buying back shares sufficient to offset those issued under incentive compensation plans.\n•\nProceeds from the exercise of stock options, including tax benefits.  \nIn 2024 we received $14.7 million from employee exercises of stock options and paid $32.8 million of employee taxes withheld from share-based awards. \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 36\nIn 2023 we received $26.0 million from employee exercises of stock options and paid $35.0 million of employee taxes withheld from share-based awards.  In 2022 we received $34.2 million from employee exercises of stock options and paid $35.5 million of employee taxes withheld from share-based awards.  Variances are driven primarily by the number of shares exercised and the share price at the date of grant.\nFinancial Condition\nAt December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $730.7 million.  At December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $401.9 million.  Our cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2024 increased $328.8 million compared to the 2023 year-end balance as a result of the net uses of cash outlined in the previous discussion.\nApproximately 80% of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the United States.  A majority of this balance is distributable to the United States without material tax implications, such as withholding tax.  We intend to continue to reinvest the remainder of the earnings outside of the United States for which there would be a material tax implication to distributing for the foreseeable future and, therefore, have not recognized additional tax expense on these earnings.  We believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.  Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt.  Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various short- and long-term cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.\nWe maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital.  We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders’ equity.  Our total short- and long-term debt was $5.1 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  Our total debt increased in 2024 primarily due to an increase of $587 million in short-term debt, primarily driven by commercial paper, partially offset by the repayment of $300 million of 2.050% Notes due upon their maturity in November 2024.\nAs a source of short-term financing, we maintain a $1.35 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings by an additional $500 million with the consent of the lenders.  As of December 31, 2024, the termination date of this agreement is April 26, 2028, however, we may extend the termination date for up to two additional one-year periods upon notice to the administrative agent under the facility.  We may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions.  As of December 31, 2024, we had $204 million of available capacity under the agreement.  The unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties and events of default.  We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2024.\nIn addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks.  As of December 31, 2024, we had available capacity of $230 million under these lines of credit.\nFurthermore, we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities.  Proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements, including reducing existing borrowings, funding the repurchase of shares of our common stock, financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements.\nOur ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit rating.  \nWe believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future.  Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt.  Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various short- and long-term cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 37\nEquity Structure\nWe have two classes of stock outstanding – Common Stock and Class B Stock. Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors.  Holders of the Common Stock have 1 vote per share.  Holders of the Class B Stock have 10 votes per share. Holders of the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of our Board.  With respect to dividend rights, holders of the Common Stock are entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock. \nHershey Trust Company, as trustee for the trust established by Milton S. and Catherine S. Hershey that has as its sole beneficiary Milton Hershey School, maintains voting control over The Hershey Company.  In addition, three representatives of Hershey Trust Company currently serve as members of the Company's Board.  In performing their responsibilities on the Company’s Board, these representatives may from time to time exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our Board or management.  Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the Trust, in its role as controlling stockholder of the Company, has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in The Hershey Company. The Company’s Board, and not the Hershey Trust Company board, is solely responsible and accountable for the Company’s management and performance.\nPennsylvania law requires that the Office of Attorney General be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the Trust, no longer having voting control of the Company.  The law provides specific statutory authority for the Attorney General to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the Trust, to stop such a transaction if the Attorney General can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the Company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations.  This legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. \nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe following table summarizes our future material cash requirements as of December 31, 2024: \nPayments due by Period\nIn millions of dollars\nTotal\nLess than 1 year\n1-3 years\n3-5 years\nMore than 5 years\nShort-term debt (primarily U.S. commercial paper)\n$\n1,307.0 \n$\n1,307.0 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \nLong-term notes (excluding finance lease obligations)\n3,743.6 \n600.0 \n693.6 \n650.0 \n1,800.0 \nInterest expense (1)\n1,122.0 \n114.5 \n195.5 \n133.8 \n678.2 \nOperating lease obligations (2)\n427.6 \n52.6 \n95.4 \n54.3 \n225.3 \nFinance lease obligations (3)\n163.8 \n10.0 \n11.6 \n8.6 \n133.6 \nUnconditional purchase obligations (4)\n1,777.7 \n1,143.4 \n510.6 \n27.4 \n96.3 \nTotal obligations\n$\n8,541.7\n$\n3,227.5\n$\n1,506.7\n$\n874.1\n$\n2,933.4\n(1)  Includes the net interest payments on fixed rate debt associated with long-term notes. \n(2)  Includes the minimum rental commitments (including imputed interest) under non-cancelable operating leases primarily for offices, retail stores, warehouses and distribution facilities. \n(3)  Includes the minimum rental commitments (including imputed interest) under non-cancelable finance leases primarily for offices and warehouse facilities, as well as machinery and equipment and vehicles.\n(4)  Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business.  Amounts presented include fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of December 31, 2024.  The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at year-end 2024, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur.  Such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 38\nIn entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.  We mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties.  Our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates.  We do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults. \nThese obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs.  To meet those cash requirements, we intend to use our existing cash and internally generated funds.  To the extent necessary, we may also borrow under our existing unsecured revolving credit facility or under other short-term borrowings, and depending on market conditions and upon the significance of the cost of a particular Note maturity or acquisition to our then-available sources of funds, to obtain additional short- and long-term financing.  We believe that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet our future short- and long-term cash requirements. \nAsset Retirement Obligations \nWe have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities.  Our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations, which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished.  We do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities.  We cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique.  We expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos. \nIncome Tax Obligations \nLiabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities.  See \nNote 10\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation on recently adopted and issued accounting standards is included in \nNote 1\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 39\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: \n•\nAccrued Liabilities for Trade Promotion Activities\n•\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Plans\n•\nBusiness Acquisitions, Valuation and Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n•\nIncome Taxes\nManagement has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board.  While we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions.  Other significant accounting policies are outlined in \nNote 1\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nAccrued Liabilities for Trade Promotion Activities \nWe promote our products with advertising, trade promotions and consumer incentives.  These programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives.  We expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred.  We recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition.  These estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past.  The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products.  Differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant.  During 2024, 2023, and 2022, actual annual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than 3%.  Our trade promotion and consumer incentive accrued liabilities totaled $221.3 million and $194.0 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Plans \nWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans. The primary plan is The Hershey Retirement Plan for Salaried and Hourly Employees. This is a cash balance plan that provides pension benefits for most U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2007. We also sponsor two post-retirement benefit plans: health care and life insurance. The health care plan is contributory, with participants’ contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.  \nFor accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates.  These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.  Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations.  Our related accounting policies, accounting balances and plan assumptions are discussed in \nNote 11\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPension Plans\nChanges in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate such obligations:\n•\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets\n.  The expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. We consider a number of factors when setting assumptions with respect to the long-term rate of return, including current and expected asset allocation and historical and expected returns on the plan asset categories.  Actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate.  Investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return estimated using the long-term rate of return and the actual return realized. For 2024, we increased the expected return on plan assets \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 40\nassumption to 6.8% from the 6.7% assumption used during 2023.  The historical average return (compounded annually) over the 20 years prior to December 31, 2024 was approximately 6.8%.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, our plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $165 million.  We amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor amount, which is the greater of 10% of a respective plan’s projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets.  These unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the expected long-term rate of investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or (iii) other actuarial gains when actual plan experience is favorable as compared to the assumed experience.  A 100 basis point decrease or increase in the long-term rate of return on pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $7 million.\n•\nDiscount rate\n. We utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.  This approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve.  This approach does not affect the measurement of our pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities but generally results in lower benefit expense in periods when the yield curve is upward sloping.\nA 100 basis point decrease (increase) in the weighted-average pension discount rate would increase the annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $5 million or decrease the annual net periodic pension benefit expense by $4 million, respectively, and the December 31, 2024 pension liability would increase by approximately $50 million or decrease by approximately $43 million, respectively.\nPension expense for defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately $13 million in 2025.  Pension expense beyond 2025 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans.\nOther Post-Employment Benefit Plans\nChanges in significant assumptions could affect consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rates used to calculate such obligations:\n•\nDiscount rate\n. The determination of the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligati\nons of the\n OPEB plans is discussed in the pension plans section above.  A 100 basis point decrease (increase) in the discount rate assumption for these plans would not be material to the OPEB plans’ consolidated expense and the December 31, 2024 benefit liability would increase by approximately $9 million or decrease by approximately $7 million, respectively.\nBusiness Acquisitions, Valuation and Imp\nairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe use the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions.  Under the acquisition method, the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions.  The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition.  Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets.  As a result, we normally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets.  The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants.  While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain.  Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead, are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present.  Our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 41\nWe test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment.  If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit.  If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.  Otherwise, no further testing is required.  For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill.  If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential (up to the carrying value of goodwill).  We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset.\nWe determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.  Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value.  Our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending.  Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses.  We believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes.  Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.\nWe also have intangible assets, consisting primarily of certain trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions, that are expected to have determinable useful lives.  The costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives.  Our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors.  We conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finite-lived assets may not be recoverable.  Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists.  If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets.\nResults of Impairment Tests\nAt December 31, 2024, the net book value of our goodwill totaled $2.7 billion.  As it relates to our 2024 annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we tested all of our reporting units using a qualitative assessment and determined that no quantitative testing was deemed necessary.  Based on our testing, all of our reporting units had an excess fair value well over their respective carrying values.  There were no other events or circumstances that would indicate that impairment may exist.  We had no goodwill impairment charges in 2024, 2023 or 2022. \nIncome Taxes\nWe base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our Company, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.  We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.  We are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities; a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally resolved.  From time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax.  We maintain reserves for such assessments.  \nWe apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions.  Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement.  Future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change.  While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome.  Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 42\nincluded in income tax expense.  We adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established.  Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.  Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.\nWe believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances.  Our valuation allowances are primarily related to U.S. capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions’ net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit.  Refer to \nNote 10\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nItem 7A.    \nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \nWe use certain derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks.  We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program.  \nWe enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures.  We enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods.  These commodity derivative instruments are intended to be, and are effective as, economic hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation costs.  We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features.  \nIn entering into these contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by entering into exchange-traded contracts with collateral posting requirements and/or by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties.  We do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults. \nRefer to \nNote 1\n and \nNote 5\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these derivative instruments and our hedging policies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe total amount of short-term debt, net of cash, amounted to net debt of $576 million and net debt of $318 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and 2023.  A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this variable-rate short-term debt as of December 31, 2024 would have changed interest expense by approximately $7.0 million for 2024 and $3.1 million for 2023.\nWe consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio, excluding fixed-rate debt converted to variable rates with fixed-to-floating instruments, to be minimal since this debt is largely long-term and fixed-rate in nature.  Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.  A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by approximately $169 million and $203 million, respectively.  However, since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 43\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  We may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment, raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies.  We also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the United States.  We generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 12 months. \nA summary of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows: \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nContract\nAmount\nPrimary\nCurrencies\nContract\nAmount\nPrimary\nCurrencies\nIn millions of dollars\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts to purchase foreign currencies\n$\n184.2\nEuros\nMalaysian ringgit\nBritish pound\n$\n88.8\nEuros\nMalaysian ringgit\nBritish pound\nForeign currency forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies\n$\n140.2\nCanadian dollars\nBrazilian reals\nJapanese yen\n$\n155.3\nCanadian dollars\nBrazilian reals\nJapanese yen\nThe fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period.  We estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net fair value of these instruments was an asset of $0.7 million.  In addition, assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year-end foreign currency exchange rates, the fair value of these instruments would have declined by $32.3 million and $20.2 million, respectively, generally offset by a reduction in foreign exchange associated with our transactional activities. \nCommodities—Price Risk Management and Futures Contracts \nOur most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products, sugar, corn products, dairy products, wheat, peanuts and almonds. The cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors.  These factors include: \n•\nCommodity market fluctuations;\n•\nCurrency exchange rates;\n•\nImbalances between supply and demand;\n•\nRising levels of inflation and interest rates related to domestic and global economic conditions or supply chain issues;\n•\nThe effects of climate change and extreme weather on crop yield and quality;\n•\nSpeculative influences;\n•\nTrade agreements among producing and consuming nations;\n•\nSupplier compliance with commitments;\n•\nImport/export requirements for raw materials and finished goods;\n•\nPolitical unrest in producing countries;\n•\nIntroduction of living income premiums or similar requirements;\n•\nChanges in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies; and\n•\nOther events beyond our control such as the impacts on the business or supply chain arising from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 44\nWe use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products, sugar, corn products, certain dairy products, wheat products, natural gas and diesel fuel primarily to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs within our supply chain.  Currently, active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements, primarily peanuts and almonds.  We attempt to minimize the effect of future raw material and energy price fluctuations by using derivatives and forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months.  However, dairy futures liquidity is not as developed as many of the other commodity futures markets and, therefore, it can be difficult to hedge dairy costs for extended periods of time.  We use diesel fuel futures to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs.  Our commodity procurement practices are intended to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases.  Our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices.\nCocoa Products\nDuring 2024, average cocoa futures contract prices increased 131.5% compared with 2023 based on the Intercontinental Exchange futures contract. The production forecast for the 2024 - 2025 season is up over 30% combined in Ghana and Ivory Coast, due to better weather and significantly improved farmer prices.  Higher cocoa prices to the consumer has lowered consumption and a return to a surplus production environment is expected in the 2024 - 2025 growing season.  The table below shows annual average cocoa futures prices and the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated.  The prices reflect the monthly averages of the close prices of the nearest active futures trading contracts (second position) on the Intercontinental Exchange.\nCocoa Futures Contract Prices\n(dollars per pound) \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nAnnual Average\n$\n3.45 \n$\n1.49 \n$\n1.13 \n$\n1.14 \n$\n1.11 \nHigh\n4.75 \n1.90 \n1.22 \n1.27 \n1.29 \nLow\n1.99 \n1.19 \n1.06 \n1.04 \n1.00 \nSource: The Cocoa Merchants Association of America Inc.\nOur costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices, premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times, and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and cocoa powder.\n \nAs a result, the average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs. \nSugar\nThe price of sugar is subject to price supports under U.S. farm legislation, which establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar.  As a result, sugar prices paid by users in the U.S. are currently higher than prices on the world sugar market.  The U.S. delivered east coast refined sugar prices traded in a range of $0.56 to $0.62 per pound during 2024.  Prices softened in 2024, driven by large domestic beet and cane crops, as well as overall healthy supply.\nCorn Products\nWe use corn futures to price our corn sweetener product requirements.  A projected record yield for the 2024 U.S. crop kept U.S. supplies healthy and drove prices down compared to 2023. Corn prices traded in the range from $3.90 to $4.85 per bushel during 2024.  Corn sweetener prices remained consistent due to tight capacity utilization throughout the industry. \n \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 45\nDairy Products\nDuring 2024, prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of $0.194 per pound to a high of $0.223 per pound, on a Class IV milk basis.  Fluid dairy milk prices were higher than 2023 due to decreases in global milk production linked to HPAI avian flu virus and blue tongue virus which impacted herd in the U.S. and Europe, respectively.\nWheat Products\nIn 2024 we continued utilizing soft and hard wheat futures as a risk management tool for our flour purchasing. Improved U.S. wheat production across the aggregate classes combined with weak global demand has resulted in lower prices across the calendar year. Hard wheat prices traded in the range of $5.35 to $7.45 per bushel during 2024, while soft wheat prices traded in the range of $5.25 to $7.21 per bushel during 2024.\nPeanuts and Almonds\nPeanut prices in the U.S. ranged from a low of $0.57 per pound to a high of $0.71 per pound during 2024.  Prices in 2024 averaged slightly higher than 2023, primarily driven by increased export demand in the first half of the year.  Almond prices traded in the range of $2.15 per pound to $2.90 per pound during 2024. Prices in 2024 averaged higher than 2023, driven by a smaller crop size and lower availability of small sized almonds.\nChanges in the Value of Futures Contracts\nWe make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange or various other exchanges.  These changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses.  The cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs.\nCommodity Sensitivity Analysis \nOur open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of $667.4 million as of December 31, 2024 and $94.9 million as of December 31, 2023.  At the end of 2024, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2024 by $1.0 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 46\nItem 8.    \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA \nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: \n42\n)\n48\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n50\nConsolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 202\n2\n52\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, \n202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 202\n2\n53\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 202\n4\n and 202\n3\n54\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, \n202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 20\n2\n2\n55\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, \n202\n4\n, 202\n3\n and 202\n2\n56\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n57\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n57\nNote 2 - Business Acquisitions\n63\nNote 3 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n64\nNote 4 - Short and Long-Term Debt\n65\nNote 5 - Derivative Instruments\n67\nNote 6 - Fair Value Measurements\n69\nNote 7 - Leases\n71\nNote 8 - Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\n73\nNote 9 - Business Realignment Activities\n74\nNote 10 - Income Taxes\n75\nNote 11 - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\n78\nNote 12 - Stock Compensation Plans\n84\nNote 13 - Segment Information\n88\nNote 14 - Equity and Treasury Stock Activity\n90\nNote 15 - Commitments and Contingencies\n92\nNote 16 - Earnings Per Share\n94\nNote 17 - Other (Income) Expense, Net\n95\nNote 18 - Related Party Transactions\n95\nNote 19 - Supplemental Balance Sheet Information\n96\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 47\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Hershey Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Hershey Company (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 48\nValuation of Accrued Liabilities for Trade Promotion Activities\nDescription of the Matter\nThe unsettled portion of the Company’s obligation for trade promotion activities at December 31, 2024 was $221.3 million.  As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company promotes its products through programs such as, but not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, and volume-based incentives.  The Company recognizes the estimated costs of these trade promotion activities as a component of variable consideration when determining the transaction price.  The unsettled portion of the Company’s obligation for trade promotion activities is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.\nAuditing management’s calculation of the unsettled portion of the Company’s obligation for trade promotion activities was subjective and required judgment as a result of the nature of the required estimates and assumptions.  In particular, the estimates required an analysis of the programs offered, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, and experience with historical payment patterns.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls related to the Company’s calculation of the accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities.  For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the completeness of the promotional activities as well as the significant assumptions and the data inputs utilized in the calculations.  \nTo test the unsettled portion of the Company’s obligation for trade promotion activities, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing (1) the expected value estimation methodology used by management, (2) whether all material trade promotion activities were properly included in management’s estimate, and (3) the assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used in its analyses.  Specifically, when evaluating the assumptions, we compared them to historical trends, third party data, and assumptions used in prior periods, and inspected management’s retrospective review of actual trade promotion activities compared to previous estimates. We also performed sensitivity analyses of assumptions to evaluate the changes in the estimate that would result from changes in the assumptions.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 18, 2025\n.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 49\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Hershey Company\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited The Hershey Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The Hershey Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the acquisition of the Sour Strips brand from Actual Candy, LLC (“Sour Strips”) on November 8, 2024, which is included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted less than 1% of total assets as of December 31, 2024 and less than 1% of net sales for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Sour Strips.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 50\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 18, 2025\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 51\nTHE

\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \nDescription of Business\nThe Hershey Company together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which it has a controlling interest, (the “Company,” “Hershey,” “we” or “us”) is a global confectionery leader known for its branded portfolio of chocolate, sweets, mints and other great tasting snacks.  The Company has more than \n90\n brands worldwide including such iconic brand names as \nHershey’s, Reese’s, Kisses, Jolly Rancher\n and \nIce Breakers,\n which are marketed, sold and distributed in approximately \n70\n countries worldwide.  Hershey’s structure is designed to ensure continued focus on North America, coupled with an emphasis on profitable growth in our focus international markets.  The Company currently operates through \nthree\n segments that are aligned with its management structure and the key markets it serves: (i) North America Confectionery, (ii) North America Salty Snacks and (iii) International.  For additional information on our segment presentation, see \nNote 13\n. \nBasis of Presentation \nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Hershey Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  We have a controlling financial interest if we own a majority of the outstanding voting common stock and minority shareholders do not have substantive participating rights, we have significant control through contractual or economic interests in which we are the primary beneficiary or we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.  We use the equity method of accounting when we have a 20% to 50% interest in other companies and exercise significant influence.  In addition, we use the equity method of accounting for our investments in partnership entities which make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and energy tax credits.  See \nNote 10\n for additional information on our equity investments in partnership entities qualifying for tax credits.  Other investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for at cost, less impairments.  Both equity method and cost, less impairment investments are included as Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  For additional information on our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, see \nNote 8\n.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures.  Our significant estimates and assumptions include, among others, pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, valuation assumptions of goodwill and other intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, marketing and trade promotion accruals and income taxes.  These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best judgment.  Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and the effects of any revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period that they are determined.  As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition \nThe majority of our revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation related to the fulfillment of customer orders for the purchase of our products, including chocolate, sweets, mints and other grocery and snack offerings.  Net sales reflect the transaction prices for these contracts based on our selling list price which is then reduced by estimated costs for trade promotional programs, consumer incentives, and allowances and discounts associated with aged or potentially unsaleable products.  We recognize revenue at the point in time that control of the ordered product(s) is transferred to the customer, which is typically upon delivery to the customer or other customer-designated delivery point.  Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis.\nOur trade promotional programs and consumer incentives are used to promote our products and include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, and volume-based incentives.  The estimated costs \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 57\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nassociated with these programs and incentives are based upon our analysis of the programs offered, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, historical sales and payment trends, and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past.  The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products.  Differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant.  During 2024, 2023 and 2022, actual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than \n3\n%. The Company’s unsettled portion remaining in accrued liabilities at year-end for these activities was $\n221,275\n and $\n194,032\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe also recognize a minor amount of royalty income (less than 1% of our consolidated net sales) from sales-based licensing arrangements, pursuant to which revenue is recognized as the third-party licensee sales occur.  Shipping and handling costs incurred to deliver product to the customer are recorded within cost of sales.  Sales, value add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue.  \nThe majority of our products are confectionery or confectionery-based and, therefore, exhibit similar economic characteristics, as they are based on similar ingredients and are marketed and sold through the same channels to the same customers.  In connection with our recent acquisitions, we have expanded our portfolio of salty snacking products, which also exhibit similar economic characteristics to our confectionery products and are sold through the same channels to the same customers.  See \nNote 13\n for revenues reported by geographic segment, which is consistent with how we organize and manage our operations, as well as product line net sales information.\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately \n27\n%, \n28\n% and \n28\n%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales were made to McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n \nCost of Sales \nCost of sales represents costs directly related to the manufacture and distribution of our products.  Primary costs include raw materials, packaging, direct labor, overhead, shipping and handling, warehousing and the depreciation of manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities.  Manufacturing overhead and related expenses include salaries, wages, employee benefits, utilities, maintenance and property taxes.\n \nSelling, Marketing and Administrative Expense\nSelling, marketing and administrative expense (“SM&A”) represents costs incurred in generating revenues and in managing our business.  Such costs include advertising and other marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of capitalized software and intangible assets and depreciation of administrative facilities. \n \nResearch and development costs, charged to expense as incurred, totaled $\n55,798\n in 2024, $\n50,030\n in 2023 and $\n46,943\n in 2022.  Advertising expense is also charged to expense as incurred and totaled $\n600,094\n in 2024, $\n604,853\n in 2023 and $\n517,677\n in 2022.  Prepaid advertising expense was $\n1,351\n as of  December 31, 2024.  There was \nno\n prepaid advertising expense as of December 31, 2023.\n \nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments, time deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less.  The fair value of cash equivalents approximates the carrying amount.\nAccounts Receivable—Trade \nIn the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria, based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of current and projected economic conditions.  Our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with McLane Company, Inc., one customer served principally by our North America Confectionery segment.  As of December 31, 2024, McLane Company, Inc. accounted for approximately \n23\n% of our total accounts receivable.  No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our year-end accounts receivable.  We believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base.  Accounts receivable-trade in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is presented net of allowances for bad debts and anticipated discounts of $\n40,487\n and $\n31,663\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 58\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nInventories \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, adjusted for the value of inventory that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or otherwise unsaleable.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately \n75\n% of our inventories, representing the majority of our United States (“U.S.”) inventories, were valued under the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method.  For the remainder of our inventories in the U.S. and inventories for our international businesses, cost is determined by either first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") or average cost.  LIFO cost of inventories valued using the LIFO method was $\n945,335\n as of December 31, 2024 and $\n741,040\n as of December 31, 2023.  The adjustment to LIFO, as shown in \nNote 19\n, approximates the excess of replacement cost over the stated LIFO inventory value. The net impact of LIFO liquidations during 2024 was $\n32,139\n. The net impact of LIFO acquisitions and liquidations was \nnot\n material to 2023 or 2022.\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment \nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: \n3\n to \n15\n years for machinery and equipment; and \n25\n to \n40\n years for buildings and related improvements.  At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, property, plant and equipment included assets under finance lease arrangements with net book values totaling $\n62,484\n and $\n69,863\n, respectively. Total depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n292,170\n, $\n265,604\n and $\n253,582\n, respectively, and included depreciation on assets recorded under finance lease arrangements. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  We capitalize applicable interest charges incurred during the construction of new facilities and production lines and amortize these costs over the assets’ estimated useful lives. \nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.  We measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of long-lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated.  If these assets are considered to be impaired, we measure impairment as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.  We report assets held for sale or disposal at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.   \nWe assess asset retirement obligations on a periodic basis and recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.  We capitalize associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.\n \nComputer Software \nWe capitalize costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable the software being developed will be completed and placed in service. Capitalized costs include only (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software, (ii) payroll and other related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal-use software project and (iii) interest costs incurred, when material, while developing internal-use software. We cease capitalization of such costs no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose. \nThe unamortized amount of capitalized software totaled $\n367,087\n and $\n360,205\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  We amortize software costs using the straight-line method over the expected life of the software, generally \n3\n to \n7\n years.  Accumulated amortization of capitalized software was $\n476,611\n and $\n395,410\n as of 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Such amounts are recorded within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe review the carrying value of software and development costs for impairment in accordance with our policy pertaining to the impairment of long-lived assets.\n \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present.  Our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter.  We test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment.  If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit.  If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 59\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nthe reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.  Otherwise, no further testing is required.  For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill.  If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential (up to the carrying value of goodwill).  We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset.  \nWe determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach.  Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.  Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value.  Our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending.  Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses.  We believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.\nThe cost of intangible assets with finite useful lives is amortized on a straight-line basis.  Our finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of certain trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions. The weighted-average amortization period for our finite-lived intangible assets is approximately \n27\n years, which is primarily driven by recently acquired trademarks.  If certain events or changes in operating conditions indicate that the carrying value of these assets, or related asset groups, may not be recoverable, we perform an impairment assessment and may adjust the remaining useful lives.  See \nNote 3\n for additional information regarding the results of impairment tests.\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations\nWe have agreements with \ntwo\n third-party financial institutions to facilitate a supplier finance program which allows qualifying suppliers to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institution. These participating suppliers negotiate their outstanding receivable arrangements directly with the financial institution, and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted.  We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements.  Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the supplier finance program and reaches an agreement with a financial institution, they elect which individual Company invoices they sell to the financial institution.  However, all Company payments to participating suppliers are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution.  The financial institution pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold under the supplier finance program.  Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted by our suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under these arrangements.  The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n \nThe rollforward of the Company’s outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under its supplier finance program, which are included in Accounts Payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: \n2024\n2023\nSupplier finance program obligations outstanding at beginning of the year\n$\n149,261\n \n$\n105,293\n \nInvoice amounts added during the year\n860,250\n \n585,872\n \nInvoice amounts paid during the year\n(\n794,389\n)\n(\n541,904\n)\nSupplier finance program obligations outstanding at end of the year\n$\n215,122\n \n$\n149,261\n \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 60\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nCurrency Translation\nThe financial statements of our foreign entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars, with the resulting translation adjustments recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).   Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while income and expense items are translated using the average exchange rates during the period.  In 2024, the Company recorded a reclassification related to foreign currency between additional paid-in capital and other comprehensive income (loss). This adjustment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments principally to offset exposure to market risks arising from changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  See \nNote 5\n for additional information on our risk management strategy and the types of instruments we use.\nDerivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values.  When we become party to a derivative instrument and intend to apply hedge accounting, we designate the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a cash flow or fair value hedge.  The accounting for changes in fair value (gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether we have designated it and it qualified as part of a hedging relationship, as noted below:\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to the extent effective and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the transaction hedged by that derivative also affects earnings.\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge, along with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the risk being hedged, are recorded in earnings, thereby reflecting in earnings the net extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. \n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument are recognized in earnings in cost of sales or SM&A, consistent with the related exposure.\nFor derivatives designated as hedges, we assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether they are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.  The ineffective portion, if any, is recorded directly in earnings.  In addition, if we determine that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.\nWe do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features.\nCash flows related to the derivative instruments we use to manage interest, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities.\n \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n.  This ASU requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), an amount for other segment items with a description of the composition, and disclosure of the title and position of the CODM.  ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.  We adopted the provisions of this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2024 and applied the provisions retrospectively to each period presented in the consolidated financial statements.  Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, \nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\n.  The ASU is intended to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates.  Entities may apply this ASU upon issuance through December \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 61\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\n31, 2022 on a prospective basis.  We early adopted the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2022.  Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, \nLiabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50):\nDisclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\n.  This ASU requires a buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about the program including the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period and potential magnitude.  ASU 2022-04 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those annual periods.  A rollforward of obligations during the annual period, including the amount of obligations confirmed and obligations subsequently paid, is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 with early adoption permitted.  This ASU should be applied retrospectively to each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively.  We early adopted provisions of this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the exception of the amendment on rollforward information, which we adopted in the fourth quarter of 2023.  Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, \nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.  \nThis ASU requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\n rather than adjust them to fair value at the acquisition date.  ASU 2021-08 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those annual periods.  This ASU should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the date of adoption.  As a result, we adopted the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2023, and was applied to acquisitions since the date of adoption.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n.  This ASU requires public business entities on an annual basis to disclose specific categories in a tabular rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a five percent quantitative threshold.  Additionally, the ASU requires all entities to disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, as well as individual jurisdictions where income taxes paid are equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid.  ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.  Early adoption is permitted and the updated should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective application permitted in the financial statements.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  As a result, we intend to adopt the provisions of this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2025. \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, \nIncome Statement—Reporting Comprehensive \nIncome—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40):  Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.  \nThis ASU requires entities to disclose certain additional expense information including, among other items, purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within each Consolidated Statement of Income expense caption.  ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027.  Early adoption is permitted and the update should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective application permitted in the financial statements.  We are currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNo other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 62\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\n2. \nBUSINESS ACQUISITIONS\nAcquisitions of businesses are accounted for as business combinations and, accordingly, the results of operations of the businesses acquired have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions.  The purchase price for each acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nIn conjunction with acquisitions noted below, we used various valuation techniques to determine fair value of the assets acquired, with the primary techniques being discounted cash flow analysis, relief-from-royalty, a form of the multi-period excess earnings and the with-and-without valuation approaches, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy.  Inputs to these valuation approaches require significant judgment including: (i) forecasted sales, growth rates and customer attrition rates, (ii) forecasted operating margins, (iii) royalty rates and discount rates used to present value future cash flows, (iv) the amount of synergies expected from the acquisition, (v) the economic useful life of assets and (vi) the evaluation of historical tax positions.  In certain acquisitions, historical data is limited; therefore, we base our estimates and assumptions on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.\n2024 Activity\nSour Strips\nOn November 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of the Sour Strips brand from Actual Candy, LLC. Sour Strips is\nan emerging sour candy brand and is available in a wide range of food distribution channels in the United States.  The initial cash consideration paid for Sour Strips was deemed immaterial and consisted of cash on hand and short-term borrowings; however, the Company may be required to pay additional contingent consideration if certain defined targets are met over a multi-year period. Acquisition-related costs for the Sour Strips acquisition were immaterial.\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, Sour Strips has been included within the North America Confectionery segment from the date of acquisition.  The purchase consideration, inclusive of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration, was allocated to minimal net assets acquired, goodwill and other intangible assets.  The purchase price allocation is preliminary as we are in the process of evaluating additional information necessary to finalize the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date including, but not limited to, post-closing adjustments to the working capital acquired.  The final fair value determination is not expected to result in material adjustments to our preliminary purchase price allocation, including other intangible assets and goodwill. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation by mid-2025.\nGoodwill was determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired (including the identifiable intangible assets).  The goodwill derived from this acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes and reflects the value of leveraging our brand building expertise, commercial capabilities and retail relationships to accelerate growth.\nOther intangible assets include trademarks valued at $\n41,800\n and customer relationships valued at $\n41,300\n. Trademarks were assigned an estimated useful life of \n22\n years and customer relationships were assigned estimated useful lives ranging from \n14\n to \n16\n years.\n2023 Activity\nManufacturing Capacity\nOn May 31, 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain assets that provide additional manufacturing capacity from Weaver Popcorn Manufacturing, Inc. (“Weaver”), a leader in the production and co-packing of microwave popcorn and ready-to-eat popcorn, and former co-manufacturer of the Company’s \nSkinnyPop\n brand.  The cash consideration paid for Weaver totaled $\n165,818\n and consisted of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. Acquisition-related costs for the Weaver acquisition were immaterial.\nThe acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, Weaver has been included within the North America Salty Snacks segment from the date of acquisition.  The purchase consideration was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values and consisted of $\n85,231\n to goodwill, \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 63\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\n$\n79,136\n to property, plant and equipment, net and $\n1,451\n to other net assets acquired.  The purchase price allocation  has been finalized as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not include measurement period adjustments.  \nGoodwill was determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  The goodwill derived from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes and reflects the value of leveraging our supply chain capabilities to accelerate growth and access to our portfolio of salty snacks products.\n3. \nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe changes in the carrying value of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: \nNorth America Confectionery\nNorth America Salty Snacks\nInternational\nTotal\nGoodwill\n$\n2,023,403\n \n$\n571,770\n \n$\n374,131\n \n$\n2,969,304\n \nAccumulated impairment loss\n(\n4,973\n)\n—\n \n(\n357,375\n)\n(\n362,348\n)\nBalance at January 1, 2023\n2,018,430\n \n571,770\n \n16,756\n \n2,606,956\n \nAcquired during the period\n—\n \n85,231\n \n—\n \n85,231\n \nForeign currency translation\n2,401\n \n—\n \n1,462\n \n3,863\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n2,020,831\n \n657,001\n \n18,218\n \n2,696,050\n \nAcquired during the period (see \nNote 2\n)\n20,723\n \n—\n \n—\n \n20,723\n \nForeign currency translation\n(\n8,697\n)\n—\n \n(\n2,323\n)\n(\n11,020\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n2,032,857\n \n$\n657,001\n \n$\n15,895\n \n$\n2,705,753\n \nWe had \nno\n goodwill impairment charges in 2024, 2023 or 2022.  \nThe following table provides the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization for each major class of intangible asset:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nIntangible assets subject to amortization:\nTrademarks\n$\n1,721,159\n \n$\n(\n282,819\n)\n$\n1,703,029\n \n$\n(\n249,947\n)\nCustomer-related\n552,594\n \n(\n151,409\n)\n513,910\n \n(\n123,282\n)\nPatents\n7,579\n \n(\n7,579\n)\n8,233\n \n(\n8,233\n)\nTotal\n2,281,332\n \n(\n441,807\n)\n2,225,172\n \n(\n381,462\n)\nIntangible assets not subject to amortization:\nTrademarks\n34,341\n \n35,519\n \nTotal other intangible assets\n$\n1,873,866\n \n$\n1,879,229\n \nTotal amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n84,640\n, $\n88,771\n and $\n79,690\n, respectively. \nAmortization expense for the next five years, based on current intangible asset balances, is estimated to be as follows:\nYear ending December 31,\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nAmortization expense\n$\n82,221\n \n$\n82,174\n \n$\n81,081\n \n$\n81,081\n \n$\n79,553\n \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 64\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\n4. \nSHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT \nShort-term Debt\nAs a source of short-term financing, we utilize cash on hand and commercial paper or bank loans with an original maturity of three months or less.  We maintain a $\n1.35\n billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings by an additional $\n500\n million with the consent of the lenders.  This facility is scheduled to expire on April 26, 2028; however, we may extend the termination date for up to \ntwo\n additional \none-year\n periods upon notice to the administrative agent under the facility.\nThe unsecured committed revolving credit agreement contains a financial covenant whereby the ratio of (a) pre-tax income from operations from the most recent four fiscal quarters to (b) consolidated interest expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters may not be less than \n2.0\n to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter.  The credit agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and events of default.  Payment of outstanding advances may be accelerated, at the option of the lenders, should we default in our obligation under the credit agreement.  As of December 31, 2024, we are in compliance with all affirmative and negative covenants and the financial covenant pertaining to our credit agreement.  There were no significant compensating balance agreements that legally restricted these funds. \nIn addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks.  Our credit limit in various currencies was $\n391,279\n at December 31, 2024 and $\n411,553\n at December 31, 2023.  These lines permit us to borrow at the respective banks’ prime commercial interest rates, or lower.  Commitment fees relating to our revolving credit facility and lines of credit are not material.  \nShort-term debt consisted of the following:  \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nShort-term foreign bank borrowings against lines of credit\n$\n161,364\n$\n192,278\nU.S. commercial paper\n1,145,612\n527,561\nTotal short-term debt\n$\n1,306,976\n$\n719,839\nWeighted average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper\n4.5\n \n%\n5.4\n \n%\nThe maximum amount of short-term borrowings outstanding during 2024 and 2023 was $\n1,321,274\n and $\n859,773\n, respectively.

We use certain derivative instruments to manage these risks.  These include interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk, foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, and commodities futures and options contracts to manage commodity market price risk exposures.\nIn entering into these contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.  We mitigate this risk by entering into exchanged-traded contracts with collateral posting requirements and/or by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties.  We do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments to reduce the effect of future price fluctuations associated with the purchase of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation services.  We generally hedge commodity price risks for \n3\n- to \n24\n-month periods.  Our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of $\n667,421\n as of December 31, 2024 and $\n94,917\n as of December 31, 2023.\nDerivatives used to manage commodity price risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.  Therefore, the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded as incurred within cost of sales.  As discussed in \nNote 13\n, we define our segment income to exclude gains and losses on commodity derivatives until the related inventory is sold, at which time the related gains and losses are reflected within segment income.  This enables us to continue to align the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged and thereby eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our reported segment income.\nForeign Exchange Price Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our international operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt and other non-functional currency transactions of certain subsidiaries.  Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound, Brazilian real, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso and Swiss franc.  We typically utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge these exposures for periods ranging from \n3\n to \n12\n months.  The contracts are either designated as cash flow hedges or are undesignated.  The net notional amount of foreign exchange contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges was $\n79,028\n at December 31, 2024 and $\n80,068\n at December 31, 2023.  The effective portion of the changes in fair value on these contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transactions affect earnings.  The net notional amount of foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was $\n123,014\n at December 31, 2024 and $\n13,665\n at December 31, 2023.  The change in fair value on these instruments is recorded directly in cost of sales or selling, marketing and administrative expense, depending on the nature of the underlying exposure. \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 67\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nInterest Rate Risk\nIn order to manage interest rate exposure, from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.  These swaps, which are settled upon issuance of the related debt, are designated as cash flow hedges and the gains and losses that are deferred in other comprehensive income are being recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period that the hedged interest payments affect earnings.\nEquity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices related to our deferred compensation obligations to our employees.  To mitigate this risk, we use equity swap contracts to hedge the portion of the exposure that is linked to market-level equity returns.  These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are entered into for periods of \n3\n to \n12\n months.  The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded in SM&A expense, together with the change in the related liabilities.  The notional amount of the contracts outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n30,524\n and $\n22,867\n, respectively.\nThe following table presents the classification of derivative assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023: \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nAssets (1)\nLiabilities (1)\nAssets (1)\nLiabilities (1)\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n8,598\n \n$\n3,280\n \n$\n1,219\n \n$\n1,670\n \nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nCommodities futures and options (2)\n514,623\n \n14,321\n \n66\n \n679\n \nDeferred compensation derivatives\n460\n \n—\n \n2,343\n \n—\n \nForeign exchange contracts\n164\n \n4,800\n \n1,123\n \n—\n \n515,247\n \n19,121\n \n3,532\n \n679\n \nTotal\n$\n523,845\n \n$\n22,401\n \n$\n4,751\n \n$\n2,349\n \n(1)\nDerivatives assets are classified on our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n within prepaid expenses and other as well as other non-current assets.

The comparable amounts reflected on a net basis in liabilities at December 31, 2023 were assets of $\n29,881\n and liabilities of $\n30,493\n.

We estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. \n(2)\nThe fair value of deferred compensation derivatives is based on quoted prices for market interest rates and a broad market equity index. \n(3)\nThe fair value of commodities futures and options contracts is based on quoted market prices.\nOther Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximated fair values as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. \nThe estimated fair value of our long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for similar debt issuances and is, therefore, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.  \nThe fair values and carrying values of long-term debt, including the current portion, were as follows:\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nAt December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n$\n597,547\n \n$\n297,842\n \n$\n604,965\n \n$\n305,058\n \nLong-term debt\n2,734,322\n \n3,413,411\n \n3,190,210\n \n3,789,132\n \nTotal\n$\n3,331,869\n \n$\n3,711,253\n \n$\n3,795,175\n \n$\n4,094,190\n \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 70\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nOther Fair Value Measurements\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, GAAP requires that, under certain circumstances, we also record assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  \n2024 Activity\nIn connection with the acquisition of Sour Strips in 2024, as discussed in \nNote 2\n, we used various valuation techniques to determine fair value, with the primary techniques being discounted cash flow analysis and the relief-from-royalty, a form of the multi-period excess earnings, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Additionally, we estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\n2023 Activity\nIn connection with the acquisition of Weaver during 2023, as discussed in \nNote 2\n, we used various valuation techniques to determine fair value, with the primary technique being the cost approach to value personal property, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy.\n \n7.  \nLEASES\nWe lease office and retail space, warehouse and distribution facilities, land, vehicles, and equipment.  We determine if an agreement is or contains a lease at inception.  Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.  ROU assets and liabilities are based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term and are recognized at the lease commencement date.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments.  The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.  A limited number of our lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation.  Our lease agreements generally do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nFor real estate, equipment and vehicles that support selling, marketing and general administrative activities the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.  These asset categories comprise the majority of our leases.  The lease and non-lease components of real estate and equipment leases supporting production activities are not accounted for as a single lease component.  Consideration for such contracts is allocated to the lease component and non-lease components based upon relative standalone prices either observable or estimated if observable prices are not readily available. \nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nLease expense\nClassification\n2024\n2023\nOperating lease cost\nCost of sales or SM&A (1)\n$\n53,141\n \n$\n48,577\n \nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of ROU assets\nDepreciation and amortization (1)\n9,017\n \n8,140\n \nInterest on lease liabilities\nInterest expense, net\n4,702\n \n4,593\n \nNet lease cost (2)\n$\n66,860\n \n$\n61,310\n \n(1)\nSupply chain-related amounts were included in cost of sales.\n(2)\nNet lease cost does not include short-term leases, variable lease costs or sublease income, all of which are immaterial.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 71\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nInformation regarding our lease terms and discount rates were as follows:\n2024\n2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\nOperating leases\n12.4\n14.4\nFinance leases\n25.9\n25.9\nWeighted-average discount rate\nOperating leases\n3.7\n \n%\n3.5\n \n%\nFinance leases\n6.3\n \n%\n6.2\n \n%\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases were as follows:\nLeases\nClassification\n2024\n2023\nAssets\nOperating lease ROU assets\nOther non-current assets\n$\n337,739\n \n$\n307,976\n \nFinance lease ROU assets, at cost\nProperty, plant and equipment, gross\n87,999\n \n89,335\n \nAccumulated amortization\nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n25,515\n)\n(\n19,472\n)\nFinance lease ROU assets, net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n62,484\n \n69,863\n \nTotal leased assets\n$\n400,223\n \n$\n377,839\n \nLiabilities\nCurrent\nOperating\nAccrued liabilities\n$\n40,636\n \n$\n34,494\n \nFinance\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n5,666\n \n5,900\n \nNon-current\nOperating\nOther long-term liabilities\n304,767\n \n277,089\n \nFinance\nLong-term debt\n68,136\n \n70,485\n \nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n419,205\n \n$\n387,968\n \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 72\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nThe maturity of our lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024 were as follows:\nOperating leases\nFinance leases\nTotal\n2025\n$\n52,557\n \n$\n9,951\n \n$\n62,508\n \n2026\n48,923\n \n6,824\n \n55,747\n \n2027\n46,511\n \n4,796\n \n51,307\n \n2028\n28,973\n \n4,366\n \n33,339\n \n2029\n25,375\n \n4,231\n \n29,606\n \nThereafter\n225,278\n \n133,638\n \n358,916\n \nTotal lease payments\n427,617\n \n163,806\n \n591,423\n \nLess: Imputed interest\n82,214\n \n90,004\n \n172,218\n \nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n345,403\n \n$\n73,802\n \n$\n419,205\n \nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to leases were as follows:\n2024\n2023\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n$\n48,757\n \n$\n45,176\n \nOperating cash flows from finance leases\n$\n4,702\n \n$\n4,593\n \nFinancing cash flows from finance leases\n$\n6,507\n \n$\n5,381\n \nROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities:\nOperating leases\n$\n71,804\n \n$\n18,469\n \nFinance leases\n$\n3,875\n \n$\n7,448\n \n8. \nINVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nWe invest in partnerships that make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and renewable energy tax credits.  The tax credits, when realized, are recognized as a reduction of tax expense under the flow-through method, at which time the corresponding equity investment is written-down to reflect the remaining value of the future benefits to be realized.  The equity investment write-down is reflected within other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income (see \nNote 17\n).\nAdditionally, we acquire ownership interests in emerging snacking businesses and startup companies, which vary in method of accounting based on our percentage of ownership and ability to exercise significant influence over decisions relating to operating and financial affairs.  These investments afford the Company the rights to distribute brands that the Company does not own to third-party customers primarily in North America.  Net sales and expenses of our equity method investees are not consolidated into our financial statements; rather, our proportionate share of earnings or losses are recorded on a net basis within other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nBoth equity method investments and cost, less impairment, investments are reported within other non-current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  We regularly review our investments and adjust accordingly for capital contributions, dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments.  Total investments in unconsolidated affiliates was $\n212,928\n and $\n207,177\n as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 73\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\n9. \nBUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES\nWe periodically undertake business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business in support of our key growth strategies.  \nAdvancing Agility & Automation Initiative\nOn February 2, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a multi-year productivity initiative (“Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative” or “AAA Initiative”) to improve supply chain and manufacturing-related spend, optimize selling, general and administrative expenses, leverage new technology and business models to further simplify and automate processes, and generate long-term savings.\nThe Company estimates that the AAA Initiative will result in total pre-tax costs of $\n200,000\n to $\n250,000\n from inception through 2026.  This estimate primarily includes program office execution and third-party costs supporting the design and implementation of the new organizational structure of $\n100,000\n to $\n120,000\n, as well as implementation and technology capability costs of $\n55,000\n to $\n70,000\n.  Additionally, we expect to incur employee severance and related separation benefits of $\n45,000\n to $\n60,000\n as we facilitate workforce reductions and reallocate resources to further drive the Company’s strategic priorities.  The cash portion of the total cost is estimated to be $\n175,000\n to $\n225,000\n.  At the conclusion of the program in 2026, ongoing annual savings are expected to be approximately $\n300,000\n.\nSince inception through December 31, 2024, we recognized total costs associated with the AAA Initiative of $\n117,536\n.  These charges predominantly included employee severance and related separation benefits related to workforce reductions and third-party costs supporting the design and implementation of the new organizational structure, as well as technology capability costs. The costs and related benefits of the AAA Initiative predominantly relates to the North America Confectionery segment and Corporate. However, segment operating results do not include these business realignment expenses because we evaluate segment performance excluding such costs.\n2020 International Optimization Program\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we commenced a program (“International Optimization Program”) to streamline resources and investments in select international markets, including the optimization of our China operating model that will improve our operational efficiency and provide for a strong, sustainable and simplified base going forward.\nThe International Optimization Program was originally expected to total pre-tax costs of  $\n50,000\n to $\n75,000\n, with cash costs in the range of $\n40,000\n to $\n65,000\n, primarily related to workforce reductions of approximately \n350\n positions outside of the United States, costs to consolidate and relocate production, and third-party costs incurred to execute these activities. The costs and related benefits of the International Optimization Program relate to the International segment. However, segment operating results do not include these business realignment expenses because we evaluate segment performance excluding such costs. This program was completed in 2023.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized total costs associated with the International Optimization Program of $\n3,440\n and $\n4,417\n, respectively.  These charges predominantly included third-party charges in support of our initiative to transform our China operating model, as well as severance and employee benefit costs.  Since inception, we have incurred pre-tax charges to execute the program totaling $\n53,799\n.\nCosts associated with business realignment activities are classified in our Consolidated Statements of

of December 31, 2023.\nWe report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.  We recognized a net tax benefit of $\n7,068\n in 2024, and a net tax expense of $\n12,027\n and $\n4,862\n in 2023 and 2022, respectively, for interest and penalties.  Accrued net interest and penalties were $\n30,286\n as of December 31, 2024 and $\n37,355\n as of December 31, 2023. \nThe Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the United States, including various state and local returns, and in other foreign jurisdictions.  We are routinely audited by taxing authorities in our filing jurisdictions, and a number of these disputes are currently underway, including multi-year controversies at various stages of review, negotiation and litigation in Mexico, Canada, Switzerland and the United States.  The outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty, including the timing of resolution or potential settlements.  If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.  Based on our current assessments, we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties.\nWe reasonably expect reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $\n5,462\n within the next 12 months because of the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlements of tax audits.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $\n1.1\n billion of undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries. We continue to reinvest the remainder of the earnings outside of the United States for which there would be a material tax implication to distributing, such as withholding tax, for the foreseeable future and, therefore, have not recognized additional tax expense on these earnings beyond the one-time U.S. repatriation tax due under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 77\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation Development\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) introduced Global Anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar Two regulations which aim to ensure that multi-national entities that exceed the threshold revenue levels are subject to a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in jurisdictions where they operate. Numerous countries, including European Union member states, have enacted, or are expected to enact, related legislation with general implementation of a global minimum tax as of January 1, 2025.  The Company is subject to OECD Pillar Two regulations, which may result in additional tax liabilities in jurisdictions where the effective tax rate falls below the 15% threshold. The Company has evaluated and will continue to monitor the impact of these new rules but does not anticipate that they will have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.\nInvestments in Partnerships Qualifying for Tax Credits\nWe invest in partnerships which make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and energy tax credits.  The investments are accounted for under the equity method and reported within other non-current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The tax credits, when realized, are recognized as a reduction of tax expense under the flow-through method, at which time the corresponding equity investment is written-down to reflect the remaining value of the future benefits to be realized.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 we recognized investment tax credits and related outside basis difference benefits totaling $\n300,597\n, $\n251,827\n and $\n228,819\n, respectively, and we wrote-down the equity investment by $\n243,311\n, $\n210,484\n and $\n188,286\n, respectively, to reflect the realization of these benefits.  The equity investment write-down is reflected within other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income (see \nNote 17\n).\n11. \nPENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS \nWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans. The primary plan is The Hershey Retirement Plan for Salaried and Hourly Employees. This is a cash balance plan that provides pension benefits for most U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2007. We also sponsor \ntwo\n post-retirement benefit plans: health care and life insurance. The health care plan is contributory, with participants’ contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is non-contributory. \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 78\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nObligations and Funded Status \nA summary of the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of these plans is as follows:\nPension Benefits \nOther Benefits \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nChange in benefit obligation\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of year\n$\n822,035\n \n$\n830,285\n \n$\n100,311\n \n$\n164,889\n \nService cost\n15,323\n \n14,991\n \n131\n \n221\n \nInterest cost\n38,675\n \n41,205\n \n4,852\n \n7,171\n \nActuarial (gain) loss\n(\n5,337\n)\n23,187\n \n4,845\n \n38,789\n \nCurtailment\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n740\n)\nSettlement\n(\n64,665\n)\n(\n66,132\n)\n—\n \n(\n88,689\n)\nCurrency translation and other\n(\n5,008\n)\n2,466\n \n(\n2,143\n)\n(\n324\n)\nBenefits paid\n(\n22,341\n)\n(\n23,967\n)\n(\n12,033\n)\n(\n21,006\n)\nProjected benefit obligation at end of year\n778,682\n \n822,035\n \n95,963\n \n100,311\n \nChange in plan assets\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n836,843\n \n848,432\n \n—\n \n—\n \nActual return on plan assets\n30,626\n \n70,096\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEmployer contributions\n3,566\n \n6,576\n \n12,033\n \n21,006\n \nSettlement\n(\n64,665\n)\n(\n66,132\n)\n—\n \n(\n88,689\n)\nAnnuity purchase\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n88,689\n \nCurrency translation and other\n(\n4,052\n)\n1,838\n \n—\n \n—\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n22,341\n)\n(\n23,967\n)\n(\n12,033\n)\n(\n21,006\n)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n779,977\n \n836,843\n \n—\n \n—\n \nFunded status at end of year\n$\n1,295\n \n$\n14,808\n \n$\n(\n95,963\n)\n$\n(\n100,311\n)\nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nOther assets\n$\n41,298\n \n$\n48,506\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nAccrued liabilities\n(\n6,166\n)\n(\n4,749\n)\n(\n8,957\n)\n(\n9,593\n)\nOther long-term liabilities\n(\n33,837\n)\n(\n28,949\n)\n(\n87,006\n)\n(\n90,718\n)\nTotal\n$\n1,295\n \n$\n14,808\n \n$\n(\n95,963\n)\n$\n(\n100,311\n)\nAmounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), net of tax:\nActuarial net (loss) gain\n$\n(\n117,030\n)\n$\n(\n129,184\n)\n$\n(\n10,903\n)\n$\n(\n7,704\n)\nNet prior service credit\n4,631\n \n8,561\n \n1,205\n \n527\n \nNet amounts recognized in AOCI\n$\n(\n112,399\n)\n$\n(\n120,623\n)\n$\n(\n9,698\n)\n$\n(\n7,177\n)\nThe projected benefit obligation during 2024 was impacted by actuarial gain of $\n5,337\n which was mainly the result of the discount rate assumption increasing from \n5.1\n% at December 31, 2023 to \n5.5\n% at December 31, 2024.

The plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates.  We base the asset return assumption on current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the plan asset categories. \nWe utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.  This approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve.  This approach does not affect the measurement of our pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities, but generally results in lower benefit expense in periods when the yield curve is upward sloping.\nFor purposes of measuring our post-retirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2024, we assumed a \n6.9\n% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for 2025, grading down to \n4.9\n% by 2033.  For purposes of measuring our post-retirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2023, we assumed a \n6.4\n% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for 2024, grading down to \n5.0\n% by 2030. \nThe valuations and assumptions reflect adoption of the Society of Actuaries updated Pri-2012 mortality tables with MP-2021 generational projection scales, which we adopted as of December 31, 2021.  The Society of Actuaries did not update the Pri-2012 mortality tables in 2023 or 2024.  \nPlan Assets\nWe broadly diversify our pension plan assets across public equity, fixed income, diversified credit strategies and diversified alternative strategies asset classes.  \nOur target asset allocation for our major domestic pension plans as of December 31, 2024 was as follows: \nAsset Class\nTarget Asset Allocation \nCash\n1\n%\nEquity securities\n27\n%\nFixed income securities\n48\n%\nAlternative investments, including real estate, listed infrastructure and other\n24\n%\nAs of December 31, 2024, actual allocations were consistent with the targets and within our allowable ranges.

We comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) and we prohibit investments and investment strategies not allowed by ERISA.  We do not permit direct purchases of our Company’s securities or the use of derivatives for the purpose of speculation.  We invest the assets of non-domestic plans in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans.  \nCash Flows and Plan Termination\nOur policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the ERISA, federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.  We fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans.  \nWe made total contributions to the pension plans of $\n3,566\n during 2024.  In 2023, we made total contributions of $\n6,576\n to the pension plans.  For 2025, minimum funding requirements for our pension plans are approximately $\n1,936\n. \nTotal benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants, including pension benefits funded from the plans and other benefits funded from Company assets, are as follows:\nExpected Benefit Payments\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030-2034\nPension Benefits\n$\n119,232\n \n$\n80,359\n \n$\n103,062\n \n$\n72,257\n \n$\n70,008\n \n$\n291,879\n \nOther Benefits\n8,957\n \n8,372\n \n7,918\n \n7,569\n \n7,303\n \n32,483\n \nAnnuitization of Other Post Employment Benefits\nOn August 21, 2023, the Hershey Employee Benefits Committee approved the purchase of an irrevocable group annuity contract with an insurance company for eligible retirees of The Hershey Company Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plan to cover their medical benefits.

As a result of this transaction, we remeasured the projected benefit obligation and recognized a $\n926\n non-cash pre-tax settlement charge during the quarter ended October 1, 2023.\nSavings Plans\nThe Company sponsors several defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits to employees.  Contributions to The Hershey Company 401(k) Plan and similar plans for non-domestic employees are based on a portion of eligible \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 83\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\npay up to a defined maximum.  All matching contributions were made in cash.  Expense associated with the defined contribution plans was $\n74,094\n in 2024, $\n67,763\n in 2023 and $\n61,477\n in 2022.\n12. \nSTOCK COMPENSATION PLANS\nShare-based grants for compensation and incentive purposes are made pursuant to the Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (“EICP”).  The EICP provides for grants of one or more of the following stock-based compensation awards to employees, non-employee directors and certain service providers upon whom the successful conduct of our business is dependent: \n•\nNon-qualified stock options (“stock options”);\n•\nPerformance stock units (“PSUs”) and performance stock;\n•\nStock appreciation rights;\n•\nRestricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock; and\n•\nOther stock-based awards.\nAs of December 31, 2024, \n68.5\n million shares were authorized and approved by our stockholders for grants under the EICP.  The EICP also provides for the deferral of stock-based compensation awards by participants if approved by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of our Board and if in accordance with an applicable deferred compensation plan of the Company.  Currently, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee has authorized the deferral of PSU and RSU awards by certain eligible employees under the Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan.  Our Board has authorized our non-employee directors to defer any portion of their cash retainer, committee chair fees and RSUs awarded that they elect to convert into deferred stock units under our Directors’ Compensation Plan. \nAt the time stock options are exercised or PSUs and RSUs become payable, Common Stock is issued from our accumulated treasury shares.  Dividend equivalents are credited on RSUs on the same date and at the same rate as dividends paid on our Common Stock.  Dividend equivalents are charged to retained earnings and included in accrued liabilities until paid.\nAwards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award.  In addition, historical data is used to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.\nFor the periods presented, compensation expense for all types of stock-based compensation programs and the related income tax benefit recognized were as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPre-tax compensation expense\n$\n44,414\n \n$\n81,021\n \n$\n65,991\n \nRelated income tax benefit\n5,418\n \n11,910\n \n9,635\n \nCompensation expenses for stock compensation plans are primarily included in SM&A expense.  As of December 31, 2024, total stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $\n53,368\n and the weighted-average period over which this amount is expected to be recognized was approximately \n1.7\n years.\nStock Options \nThe exercise price of each stock option awarded under the EICP equals the closing price of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.  Each stock option has a maximum term of \n10\n years.  Grants of stock options provide for pro-rated vesting, typically over a \nfour-year\n period.  Expense for stock options is based on grant date fair value and recognized on a straight-line method over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 84\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nA summary of activity relating to grants of stock options for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows: \nStock Options\nShares\nWeighted-Average \nExercise Price (per share)\nWeighted-Average Remaining\nContractual Term\nAggregate Intrinsic Value\nOutstanding at beginning of the period\n726,701\n \n$\n105.67\n3.3\n years\nGranted\n2,455\n \n$\n192.49\nExercised\n(\n146,202\n)\n$\n102.02\nForfeited\n(\n1,555\n)\n$\n147.98\nExpired\n(\n1,565\n)\n$\n147.98\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2024\n579,834\n \n$\n106.73\n2.7\n years\n$\n36,872\nOptions exercisable as of December 31, 2024\n566,004\n \n$\n104.69\n2.6\n years\n$\n36,756\n \nThe weighted-average fair value of options granted was $\n45.95\n, $\n57.65\n and $\n37.28\n per share in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nThe fair value was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the following weighted-average assumptions:\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDividend yields\n2.0\n \n%\n1.7\n \n%\n1.9\n \n%\nExpected volatility\n21.3\n \n%\n20.9\n \n%\n21.1\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rates\n4.3\n \n%\n4.1\n \n%\n1.9\n \n%\nExpected term in years\n6.3\n6.3\n6.3\n•\n“Dividend yields” means the sum of dividends declared for the four most recent quarterly periods, divided by the average price of our Common Stock for the comparable periods;\n•\n“Expected volatility” means the historical volatility of our Common Stock over the expected term of each grant;\n•\n“Risk-free interest rates” means the U.S. Treasury yield curve rate in effect at the time of grant for periods within the contractual life of the stock option; and\n•\n“Expected term” means the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $\n14,018\n, $\n35,474\n and $\n40,882\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $\n545\n of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option awards granted under the EICP, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of \n0.8\n years. \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 85\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2024: \n \nOptions Outstanding\nOptions Exercisable\nRange of Exercise Prices\nNumber Outstanding as of 12/31/24\nWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life in Years \nWeighted-Average Exercise Price  \nNumber Exercisable as of 12/31/24\nWeighted-Average Exercise Price \n$\n60.68\n - $\n99.90\n337,308\n \n2.6\n$\n97.24\n337,308\n \n$\n97.24\n$\n99.91\n - $\n107.95\n116,610\n \n1.9\n$\n107.68\n116,610\n \n$\n107.68\n$\n107.96\n - $\n240.90\n125,916\n \n3.7\n$\n131.25\n112,086\n \n$\n124.00\n$\n60.68\n - $\n240.90\n579,834\n \n2.7\n$\n106.73\n566,004\n \n$\n104.69\nPerformance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units \nUnder the EICP, we grant PSUs to selected executives and other key employees.  Vesting is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance objectives.  We grant PSUs over \n3\n-year performance cycles.  If we meet targets for financial measures at the end of the applicable \n3\n-year performance cycle, we award a resulting number of shares of our Common Stock to the participants.  The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award\n.\n \nFor PSUs granted, the target award is a combination of a market-based total shareholder return and performance-based components.  For market-based condition components, market volatility and other factors are taken into consideration in determining the grant date fair value and the related compensation expense is recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided.  For performance-based condition components, we estimate the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved each quarter and adjust compensation expenses accordingly.  The performance scores of PSUs granted in 2024, 2023, and 2022 can range from \n0\n% to \n250\n% of the targeted amounts. \nWe recognize the compensation expense associated with PSUs ratably over the \n3\n-year term.  Compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value because the grants can only be settled in shares of our Common Stock.  The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based total shareholder return component and the closing market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant for performance-based components.\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, we awarded RSUs to certain executive officers and other key employees under the EICP.  We also awarded RSUs quarterly to non-employee directors. \nWe recognize the compensation expense associated with employee RSUs over a specified award vesting period based on the grant date fair value of our Common Stock.  We recognize expense for employee RSUs based on the straight-line method.  The compensation expense associated with non-employee director RSUs is recognized ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 86\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nA summary of activity relating to grants of PSUs and RSUs for the period ended December 31, 2024 is as follows: \nPerformance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units\nNumber of units\nWeighted-average grant date fair value for equity awards (per unit)\nOutstanding at beginning of year\n1,039,691\n \n$\n198.31\nGranted\n392,046\n \n$\n194.43\nPerformance assumption change (1)\n(\n301,291\n)\n$\n210.95\nVested\n(\n506,293\n)\n$\n179.10\nForfeited\n(\n85,350\n)\n$\n210.01\nOutstanding at end of year\n538,803\n \n$\n204.65\n(1)\nReflects the net number of PSUs above and below target levels based on the performance metrics.\nThe following table sets forth information about the fair value of the PSUs and RSUs granted for potential future distribution to employees and non-employee directors.

This organizational structure aligns with how our CODM, Michele Buck, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer manages our business, including resource allocation and performance assessment, and further aligns with our product categories and the key markets we serve.\n•\nNorth America Confectionery\n – \nThis segment is responsible for our traditional chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery market position in the United States and Canada.  This includes our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, gum and refreshment products, protein bars, spreads, snack bites and mixes, as well as pantry and food service lines.  This segment also includes our retail operations, including Hershey’s Chocolate World stores in Hershey, Pennsylvania; New York, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Niagara Falls (Ontario) and Singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain of the Company’s trademarks and products to third parties around the world.\n•\nNorth America Salty Snacks\n \n–\n This segment is responsible for our salty snacking products in the United States.  This includes ready-to-eat popcorn, baked and trans fat free snacks, pretzels and other snacks.\n•\nInternational\n – \nInternational is a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually material, including those geographic regions where we operate outside of North America.  We currently have operations and manufacture product in Mexico, Brazil, India and Malaysia, primarily for consumers in these regions, and also distribute and sell confectionery products in export markets of Asia, Latin America, Middle East, Europe, Africa and other regions.\nFor segment reporting purposes, the CODM uses “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources, including considering budget-to-actual variances and prior year-to-actual variances on a monthly basis.  Segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance.  These items of our operating profit are managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the CODM as well the measure of segment performance used for incentive compensation purposes.\nAccounting policies associated with our operating segments are generally the same as those described in \nNote 1\n.\nAs discussed in \nNote 5\n, derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.  These derivatives are recognized at fair market value with the resulting realized and unrealized (gains) losses recognized in unallocated derivative (gains) losses outside of the reporting segment results until the related inventory is sold, at which time the related gains and losses are reallocated to segment income.  This enables us to align the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged and thereby eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our reported segment income.\nCertain manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and other activities supporting our global operations are integrated to maximize efficiency and productivity.  As a result, assets and capital expenditures are not managed on a segment basis and are not included in the information reported to the CODM for the purpose of evaluating performance or allocating resources.  We disclose depreciation and amortization that is generated by segment-specific assets, since these amounts are included within the measure of segment income reported to the CODM.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 88\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nOur segment net sales and earnings were as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\nNorth America Confectionery\nNorth America Salty Snacks\nInternational\nTotal\nNet sales\n$\n9,118,590\n \n$\n1,135,720\n \n$\n947,953\n \n$\n11,202,263\n \nCost of sales\n4,984,764\n \n719,850\n \n642,634\n \nSM&A expense\n1,188,138\n \n216,480\n \n193,800\n \nTotal segment income\n$\n2,945,688\n \n$\n199,390\n \n$\n111,519\n \n$\n3,256,597\n \nUnallocated corporate expense (1)\n701,266\n \nUnallocated mark-to-market gains on commodity derivatives\n(\n460,437\n)\nCosts associated with business realignment activities (see \nNote 9\n)\n117,536\n \nOperating profit\n$\n2,898,232\n \nInterest expense, net (see \nNote 4\n)\n165,655\n \nOther (income) expense, net (see \nNote 17\n)\n258,641\n \nIncome before income taxes\n$\n2,473,936\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\nNorth America Confectionery\nNorth America Salty Snacks\nInternational\nTotal\nNet sales\n$\n9,123,139\n \n$\n1,092,689\n \n$\n949,164\n \n$\n11,164,992\n \nCost of sales\n4,781,671\n \n726,569\n \n601,175\n \nSM&A expense\n1,224,424\n \n207,787\n \n199,730\n \nTotal segment income\n$\n3,117,044\n \n$\n158,333\n \n$\n148,259\n \n$\n3,423,636\n \nUnallocated corporate expense (1)\n800,390\n \nUnallocated mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives\n58,939\n \nCosts associated with business realignment activities (see \nNote 9\n)\n3,440\n \nOperating profit\n$\n2,560,867\n \nInterest expense, net (see \nNote 4\n)\n151,785\n \nOther (income) expense, net (see \nNote 17\n)\n237,218\n \nIncome before income taxes\n$\n2,171,864\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022\nNorth America Confectionery\nNorth America Salty Snacks\nInternational\nTotal\nNet sales\n$\n8,536,480\n \n$\n1,029,405\n \n$\n853,409\n \n$\n10,419,294\n \nCost of sales\n4,573,435\n \n704,589\n \n560,258\n \nSM&A expense\n1,151,979\n \n164,881\n \n185,224\n \nTotal segment income\n$\n2,811,066\n \n$\n159,935\n \n$\n107,927\n \n$\n3,078,928\n \nUnallocated corporate expense (1)\n735,542\n \nUnallocated mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives\n78,182\n \nCosts associated with business realignment activities (see \nNote 9\n)\n4,417\n \nOperating profit\n$\n2,260,787\n \nInterest expense, net (see \nNote 4\n)\n137,557\n \nOther (income) expense, net (see \nNote 17\n)\n206,159\n \nIncome before income taxes\n$\n1,917,071\n \n(1)\nIncludes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury, finance, and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations, including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash stock-based \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 89\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\ncompensation expense, (d) acquisition-related costs and (e) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance.\nActivity within the unallocated mark-to-market losses (gains) on commodity derivatives is as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet (gains) losses on mark-to-market valuation of commodity derivative positions recognized in income\n$\n(\n509,870\n)\n$\n53,085\n \n$\n(\n44,569\n)\nNet gains on commodity derivative positions reclassified from unallocated to segment income \n49,433\n \n5,854\n \n122,751\n \nNet (gains) losses on mark-to-market valuation of commodity derivative positions recognized in unallocated derivative losses (gains)\n$\n(\n460,437\n)\n$\n58,939\n \n$\n78,182\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the cumulative amount of mark-to-market gains on commodity derivatives that have been recognized in our consolidated cost of sales and not yet allocated to reportable segments was $\n410,230\n.

Total obligations consisted of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of December 31, 2024. \nThe cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods. We mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent that we have entered into commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments to hedge our costs for those periods.  Increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments.  Taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts.  For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had entered into agreements for the purchase of raw materials with various suppliers.  Subject to meeting our quality standards, the purchase obligations covered by these agreements were as follows as of December 31, 2024: \nin millions\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nPurchase obligations\n$\n1,143.4\n \n$\n496.7\n \n$\n13.9\n \n$\n13.7\n \n$\n13.7\n \nEnvironmental contingencies\nWe have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities.  Our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations, which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished.  We do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities.  We cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique.  We expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos. \nLegal contingencies\nThe Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, which cover a wide range of matters including trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters, human and workplace rights matters and tax.  While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of such proceedings and claims with certainty, in our opinion these matters, both individually and in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 92\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nCollective Bargaining\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company employed approximately \n18,540\n full-time and \n1,490\n part-time employees worldwide.

The Class B common stock is convertible into Common Stock on a share-for-share basis at any time. The computation of diluted earnings per share for Common Stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock using the if-converted method, while the diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares. \nWe compute basic and diluted earnings per share based on the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock and Class B common stock outstanding as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCommon Stock\nClass B Common Stock\nCommon Stock\nClass B Common Stock\nCommon Stock\nClass B Common Stock\nBasic earnings per share:\nNumerator:\nAllocation of distributed earnings (cash dividends paid)\n$\n812,826\n \n$\n271,975\n \n$\n663,176\n \n$\n225,895\n \n$\n567,897\n \n$\n207,133\n \nAllocation of undistributed earnings\n851,549\n \n284,889\n \n728,175\n \n244,541\n \n637,438\n \n232,349\n \nTotal earnings—basic\n$\n1,664,375\n \n$\n556,864\n \n$\n1,391,351\n \n$\n470,436\n \n$\n1,205,335\n \n$\n439,482\n \nDenominator (shares in thousands):\nTotal weighted-average shares—basic\n148,349\n \n54,614\n \n149,499\n \n55,239\n \n146,713\n \n58,822\n \nEarnings Per Share—basic\n$\n11.22\n \n$\n10.20\n \n$\n9.31\n \n$\n8.52\n \n$\n8.22\n \n$\n7.47\n \nDiluted earnings per share:\nNumerator:\nAllocation of total earnings used in basic computation\n$\n1,664,375\n \n$\n556,864\n \n$\n1,391,351\n \n$\n470,436\n \n$\n1,205,335\n \n$\n439,482\n \nReallocation of total earnings as a result of conversion of Class B common stock to Common stock\n556,864\n \n—\n \n470,436\n \n—\n \n439,482\n \n—\n \nReallocation of undistributed earnings\n—\n \n(\n753\n)\n—\n \n(\n987\n)\n—\n \n(\n1,201\n)\nTotal earnings—diluted\n$\n2,221,239\n \n$\n556,111\n \n$\n1,861,787\n \n$\n469,449\n \n$\n1,644,817\n \n$\n438,281\n \nDenominator (shares in thousands):\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\n148,349\n \n54,614\n \n149,499\n \n55,239\n \n146,713\n \n58,822\n \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities:\nConversion of Class B common stock to Common shares outstanding\n54,614\n \n—\n \n55,239\n \n—\n \n58,822\n \n—\n \nEmployee stock options\n285\n \n—\n \n424\n \n—\n \n571\n \n—\n \nPerformance and restricted stock units\n239\n \n—\n \n385\n \n—\n \n469\n \n—\n \nTotal weighted-average shares—diluted\n203,487\n \n54,614\n \n205,547\n \n55,239\n \n206,575\n \n58,822\n \nEarnings Per Share—diluted\n$\n10.92\n \n$\n10.18\n \n$\n9.06\n \n$\n8.50\n \n$\n7.96\n \n$\n7.45\n \nThe earnings per share calculations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 excluded \n13\n, \n15\n and \n5\n stock options (in thousands), respectively, that would have been antidilutive.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 94\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\n17. \nOTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET\nOther (income) expense, net reports certain gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to our core operations.  \nA summary of the components of other (income) expense, net is as follows: \nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWrite-down of equity investments in partnerships qualifying for historic and renewable energy tax credits (see \nNote 8\n)\n$\n243,311\n \n$\n210,484\n \n$\n188,286\n \nNon-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans (see \nNote 11\n)\n17,389\n \n28,010\n \n18,466\n \nOther (income) expense, net\n(\n2,059\n)\n(\n1,276\n)\n(\n593\n)\nTotal\n$\n258,641\n \n$\n237,218\n \n$\n206,159\n \n18. \nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nHershey Trust Company, as trustee for the trust established by Milton S. and Catherine S.

Most transactions with these related parties are immaterial and do not require disclosure, but certain transactions are more significant in nature and have been deemed material for disclosure. \nThere were \nno\n material related party transactions with Hershey Trust Company and/or its affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2024.  A summary of material related party transactions with Hershey Trust Company and/or its affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is noted below.  \nSale and Donation of Property, Plant and Equipment\nIn May 2022, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell certain real and personal property consisting of approximately \nsix\n acres of land located in Hershey, Pennsylvania, together with portions of a building located on the land.  Additionally, in June 2022, the Company entered into a Donation Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for The M.S. Hershey Foundation, pursuant to which the Company agreed to donate a portion of the building concurrently with the closing of the Purchase Agreement.  The sale and donation transactions closed in June 2022.  Total proceeds from the sale were approximately $\n6,300\n (net of transaction and closing costs), resulting in a loss of $\n13,568\n, which was recorded in the SM&A expense caption within the Consolidated Statements of Income.  The fair values of the disposed assets were supported by a proposed sales price submitted by a third-party buyer received prior to executing the Purchase Agreement.\nStock Purchase Agreements\nIn February 2023 and February 2022, the Company entered into Stock Purchase Agreements with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, pursuant to which the Company purchased shares of its Common Stock from the School Trust (see \nNote 14\n).\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 95\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\n19. \nSUPPLEMENTAL BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION \nThe components of certain asset accounts included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nInventories:\nRaw materials\n$\n477,592\n \n$\n481,111\n \nGoods in process\n204,674\n \n192,232\n \nFinished goods\n990,785\n \n948,974\n \nInventories at FIFO\n1,673,051\n \n1,622,317\n \nAdjustment to LIFO\n(\n418,957\n)\n(\n281,321\n)\nTotal inventories\n$\n1,254,094\n \n$\n1,340,996\n \nPrepaid expenses and other:\nPrepaid expenses\n$\n269,792\n \n$\n227,567\n \nOther current assets\n704,423\n \n118,021\n \nTotal prepaid expenses and other\n$\n974,215\n \n$\n345,588\n \nProperty, plant and equipment:\nLand\n$\n194,502\n \n$\n180,751\n \nBuildings\n1,991,937\n \n1,763,070\n \nMachinery and equipment\n4,147,530\n \n3,861,006\n \nConstruction in progress\n478,842\n \n644,244\n \nProperty, plant and equipment, gross\n6,812,811\n \n6,449,071\n \nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n3,353,958\n)\n(\n3,139,393\n)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n$\n3,458,853\n \n$\n3,309,678\n \nOther non-current assets:\nPension\n$\n41,298\n \n$\n48,506\n \nCapitalized software, net\n367,087\n360,205\n \nOperating lease ROU assets\n337,739\n \n307,976\n \nInvestments in unconsolidated affiliates\n212,928\n \n207,177\n \nOther non-current assets\n152,815\n \n137,563\n \nTotal other non-current assets\n$\n1,111,867\n \n$\n1,061,427\n \nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 96\nTHE HERSHEY COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)\nThe components of certain liability and stockholders’ equity accounts included within our  Consolidated Balance Sheet accounts are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nAccounts Payable:\nAccounts Payable—trade\n$\n807,918\n \n$\n630,536\n \nSupplier finance program obligations\n215,122\n149,261\nOther\n136,137\n306,386\nTotal accounts payable\n$\n1,159,177\n \n$\n1,086,183\n \nAccrued liabilities:\nPayroll, compensation and benefits\n$\n226,774\n \n$\n261,961\n \nAdvertising, promotion and product allowances\n359,986\n \n343,444\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n40,636\n \n34,494\n \nOther\n179,945\n \n227,916\n \nTotal accrued liabilities\n$\n807,341\n \n$\n867,815\n \nOther long-term liabilities:\nPost-retirement benefits liabilities\n$\n87,006\n \n$\n90,718\n \nPension benefits liabilities\n33,837\n \n28,949\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n304,767\n \n277,089\n \nOther\n262,649\n \n263,917\n \nTotal other long-term liabilities\n$\n688,259\n \n$\n660,673\n \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss:\nForeign currency translation adjustments\n$\n(\n177,741\n)\n$\n(\n87,706\n)\nPension and post-retirement benefit plans, net of tax\n(\n122,098\n)\n(\n126,800\n)\nCash flow hedges, net of tax\n(\n4,051\n)\n(\n15,572\n)\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive loss\n$\n(\n303,890\n)\n$\n(\n230,078\n)\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 97\nItem 9.     \nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n \nNone.\nItem 9A.     \nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n \nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as of December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.\nDesign and Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement’s report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting appears on the following page.  During the second quarter of 2024, we completed the process of our multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, which replaced our then-existing operating and financial systems.  The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records, enhance operational functionality, and provide timely information to the Company’s management team related to the operation of the business.  During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the implementation of one operating segment that is included in our International segment.  In July 2023, we completed the transition to our new consolidated financial reporting book of record.  During October 2023, we completed the implementation of our new ERP system in the North America Salty Snacks segment.  We completed the implementation of our new ERP system in the North America Confectionery segment and select operating segments included in our International segment in April 2024.  The implementation of the new ERP system resulted in material changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has updated the internal controls as appropriate and will continue to monitor the impact of the implementation on our financial reporting business processes.  There have been no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 98\nMANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of The Hershey Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  The Company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. \nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. \nThe Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.  In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in \nInternal Control–Integrated Framework (2013 edition)\n.  Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. \nManagement’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the acquisition of the Sour Strips brand from Actual Candy, LLC (“Sour Strips”) on November 8, 2024, which is included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted less than 1% of total assets as of December 31, 2024 and less than 1% of net sales for the year then ended. This exclusion is in accordance with the guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows companies to exclude acquisitions from management’s report on internal control over financial reporting for the first year after the acquisition.\nThe Company’s independent auditors have audited, and reported on, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\nItem 9B.     \nOTHER INFORMATION\n \nDirector and Executive Officer Trading\nA portion of our directors’ and officers’ compensation is in the form of equity awards and, from time to time, they may engage in open-market transactions with respect to their Company securities for diversification or other personal reasons.  All such transactions in Company securities by directors and officers must comply with the Company’s Insider Trading Policy, which requires that transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information.  Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in the Company’s securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information.  \nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, no directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of securities that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any other Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or “non-Rule 10b5–1 trading arrangements” (as defined by S-K Item 408(c)).\nItem 9C.     \nDISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNone.\nTable of Contents\nThe Hershey Company  |  2024 Form 10-K  |  Page 99\nPART III \nItem 10.     \nDIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.\nThe information regarding executive officers of the Company required by Item 401 of SEC Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference from the disclosure included under the caption “Supplemental Item.
