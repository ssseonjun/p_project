(also referred to herein as the U.S., the United States or the United States of America), whose subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Throughout these financial statements, the term \"PMI\" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries.  \nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB”) is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.\nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking.\nOn September 17, 2024, PMI announced the execution of a definitive agreement pursuant to which PMI’s direct, wholly-owned subsidiary, Vectura Fertin Pharma Inc., agreed to sell Vectura Group Ltd. (formerly, Vectura Group plc, and hereinafter referred to as “Vectura” or \"Vectura Group\") to Molex Asia Holdings Ltd. The transaction was completed on December 31, 2024. For further details, see Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures.  \nBasis of presentation\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things: pension and benefit plan assumptions; useful lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and other intangible assets; valuation assumptions for non-marketable equity securities; marketing programs, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements include PMI, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which PMI exercises significant influence (generally 20%-50% ownership interest) are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value, if it is readily determinable, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Investments without readily determinable fair values, non-marketable equity securities, are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that values the security at cost minus any impairment.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the \nfour\n existing geographical segments. The \nfour\n existing geographical segments are as follows: Europe Region; South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS & MEA\"); East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU & PMI DF\"); and Americas Region. The Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&H\") segment remained unchanged.\nCertain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation as a result of the new segment structure discussed above. For further details, see Note 5. \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\n, Note 13.\n Segment Reporting \nand Note 20. \nRestructuring Activities. \nThese reclassifications did not impact PMI's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.\n \n \n83\nNote 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies:   \nAcquisitions\nPMI uses the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses.  Under the acquisition method, PMI’s consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition.  PMI allocates the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.  Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill.  The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date.  Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statement of earnings.  Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.  \nIf PMI determines that assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded.  In an asset acquisition, acquired in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") with no alternative future use is charged to expense.\n \nCash and cash equivalents\nCash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nDepreciation and Amortization \nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Machinery and equipment are depreciated primarily over periods ranging from \n3\n to \n15\n years, and buildings and building improvements primarily over periods up to \n40\n years. \n \nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives.  For further details, see Note 5. \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\n.\n \nEmployee benefit plans\nPMI provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance).  PMI records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified under U.S. GAAP.  PMI recognizes the funded status of its defined pension and postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets.  The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the benefit obligation.  PMI measures the plan assets and liabilities at the end of the fiscal year.  For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation.  For the postretirement health care plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.  Any plan with an overfunded status is recognized as an asset, and any plan with an underfunded status is recognized as a liability.  Any gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs are recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred taxes.  PMI elects to recognize actuarial gains/(losses) using the corridor approach.\nFair value measurements  \nPMI follows ASC 820, \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.  The guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The guidance describes three levels of input that may be used to measure fair value.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n84\nForeign currency translation\nPMI translates the results of operations of its subsidiaries and affiliates, except those operating in highly inflationary economies, using average exchange rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of stockholders’ (deficit) equity. In addition, some of PMI’s subsidiaries have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies, and to the extent those are not designated as net investment hedges, these assets and liabilities generate transaction gains and losses when translated into their respective functional currencies. \nPMI applies highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100%. Subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date while non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement adjustments are recorded within marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n \nGoodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation\nPMI tests goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review.  PMI performs its annual impairment analysis in the second quarter of each year.  The impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value.  If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired.\n \nHedging instruments\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period either in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet or in earnings, depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.  Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are reclassified to the consolidated statements of earnings, into the same line item as the impact of the underlying transaction, in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nPMI reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  PMI performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.  For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, PMI groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.  If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.  Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the lower of carrying value or estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal.\n \nInvestment in non-marketable equity securities \nNon-marketable equity securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews during which PMI considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investees' fair value.  Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security’s fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value, and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.  For further details, see Note 6. \nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other\n.\nImpairment of equity method investments\nEquity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary.  PMI determines whether a loss is other than temporary by considering the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the equity investment has been less than the carrying amount, the financial condition of the equity investment, and the intent to retain the investment for a period of time is sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\n \n85\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are provided on all earnings for jurisdictions outside the United States.  These provisions, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI’s consolidated balance sheets.  Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.  PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of earnings.  PMI recognizes income taxes associated with Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\n \nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories.  It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\nLeases \n \nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Finance lease expense is amortized based on production activity or the lease term.   Lease expense is recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item.  At lease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its leases.  The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.  Certain of PMI’s leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage.  These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs.  PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n \nMarketing costs\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions.  Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, in-store display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives.  Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are expensed as incurred.  Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization.  For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\nRevenue recognition \nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods.  PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer’s receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI’s right to payment for those products and the customer’s ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI’s performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods. \nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer.  PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract.  The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  PMI is a principal for majority of its arrangements and recognizes revenue at the transaction price, with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable.  Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve.  \nFor arrangements where PMI acts as an agent, \nthe net commission earned is recognized as revenue.  PMI has elected to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes.  Estimated costs associated with warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.\n \n86\nResearch and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development\n \n(\"IPR&D\")  \n \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.  \nIn a business combination, the fair value of IPR&D acquired is initially capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the projects.  Upon completion, a determination as to the useful life is performed and the intangible asset is accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset.  Both the indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually or more frequently if indicators exist.  In an asset acquisition, the initial cost to acquire the IPR&D is expensed in the consolidated statements of earnings when the project has no alternative future use.  PMI records these costs within marketing, administration and research costs in its consolidated statements of earnings.\nStock-based compensation\nPMI measures compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognizes the compensation costs over the service periods for awards expected to vest.  PMI’s accounting policy is to estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjust the expense when it is no longer probable that the employee will fulfill the service condition.  For further details, see Note 10. \nStock Plans\n.\nNote 3.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures: \nSale of Vectura Group Ltd.  \nOn September 17, 2024, PMI announced the execution of a definitive agreement pursuant to which PMI’s direct, wholly-owned subsidiary, Vectura Fertin Pharma Inc., agreed to sell Vectura Group Ltd. (formerly, Vectura Group plc, and hereinafter referred to as “Vectura” or \"Vectura Group\") to Molex Asia Holdings Ltd. (\"Molex\"), subject to customary regulatory approval and other completion conditions. On December 31, 2024, PMI completed the sale of Vectura for an upfront cash consideration of GBP \n152\n million (approximately $\n191\n million) and a short-term receivable of GBP \n24\n million (approximately $\n30\n million), reflecting certain customary completion account adjustments, with additional deferred payments of up to GBP \n148\n million (approximately $\n186\n million), contingent on achievement of certain milestones over periods up to and through 2039. In addition, PMI agreed to indemnify Molex for certain claims related to the pre-completion period. For the year ended December 31, 2024, \nno\n liability has been recorded in relation to the indemnity.  \nAs of September 17, 2024, and through the completion date, Vectura's net assets and liabilities were classified as held-for-sale in PMI’s consolidated balance sheet. The sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of $\n199\n million ($\n206\n million including the tax costs), of which $\n198\n million of loss related to the impairment charge recognized in the third quarter of 2024, to record the net assets held-for-sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. This amount also included reclassification of currency translation losses from other comprehensive losses of $\n16\n million. The loss on sale of Vectura has been recorded in \nmarketing, administration and research costs\n under the Wellness and Healthcare segment in PMI’s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAltria Group, Inc. Agreement  \nOn October 20, 2022, PMI announced that it had reached an agreement with Altria Group, Inc. (\"Altria\") to end the companies' relationship regarding the \nIQOS\n commercialization rights in the U.S. as of April 30, 2024.  As a result of PMI reacquiring these rights, effective May 1, 2024 (\"acquisition date\"), PMI holds the full rights to commercialize \nIQOS\n in the U.S. As part of the agreement, PMI agreed to pay a total cash consideration of $\n2.8\n billion, including interest, of which $\n1.0\n billion was paid at the inception of the agreement and the remaining $\n1.8\n billion was paid on July 14, 2023. The cash consideration paid was accounted for within Other assets in PMI's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023.  \nOn the acquisition date and as of December 31, 2024, the reacquired rights were classified as Other intangible assets, net in PMI's consolidated balance sheets, and will be amortized over their useful life of \n5\n years. \nBusiness Combinations  \nUnited Tobacco Company \n– In April 2023, PMI acquired \n66.73\n% of Egyptian Investment Holding (“EIH”), a United Arab Emirates based company and as a result, acquired an approximate economic interest of \n25\n% in United Tobacco Company (\"UTC\"), which was \n87\naccounted for using the equity method of accounting. In May 2024, PMI increased its indirect economic interest and acquired a controlling interest of \n54.25\n% in UTC. UTC is an entity incorporated in Egypt and manufactures products under license for Philip Morris Misr LLC (“PMM”), PMI’s Egyptian subsidiary. The acquisition builds on PMI’s existing investments in Egypt and increases the manufacturing synergies between PMM and UTC.\nAs a result of PMI obtaining control over UTC, PMI’s previously held \n25\n% economic interest in UTC was remeasured to its fair value by applying the guideline transaction method adjusted for a discount for lack of control. The difference between the book value of $\n312\n million, including related cumulative translation losses balance of $\n112\n million, which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive losses and the fair value of PMI’s previously held interest in UTC was not material.\nThe total purchase price for the incremental equity interest of $\n316\n million included cash consideration of $\n31\n million, contingent consideration of $\n22\n million and $\n263\n million of assumed bank loan liabilities. During the third quarter of 2024, PMI paid the contingent consideration of $\n22\n million and $\n240\n million of assumed bank loans.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition, which includes previously held interest:\n(in millions) \nCash and cash equivalent\n$\n74\n \nCurrent assets, including receivables and inventories\n11\n \nOther intangible assets - Tobacco manufacturing license\n211\n \nOther non-current assets, including property, plant and equipment\n16\n \nCurrent liabilities\n(\n8\n)\nIdentifiable net assets acquired\n304\n \nNoncontrolling interest\n(\n160\n)\nGoodwill\n512\n \nAcquisition fair value\n$\n656\n \nGoodwill is primarily attributable to future growth opportunities, anticipated synergies in the manufacturing processes and intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition. The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was estimated based on the enterprise value of UTC, adjusted for a discount for lack of control. The manufacturing license, which relates to the manufacturing of both smoke-free and combustible tobacco products, was valued using the multi-period excess earnings method and has been determined to have an indefinite life. \nThe purchase price allocation is preliminary and continues to be subject to refinement. PMI is evaluating the deductibility of goodwill for income tax purposes. UTC's results of operations from May 16, 2024, through December 31, 2024, were included in PMI's consolidated statements of earnings and were not material. Pro forma results of operations for the business combination have not been presented as the aggregate impact is not material to PMI's consolidated statements of earnings.\nSwedish Match AB \n– On November 11, 2022 (the acquisition date), Philip Morris Holland Holdings B.V. (“PMHH”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PMI, acquired a controlling interest of \n85.87\n% of the total issued shares in Swedish Match AB (“Swedish Match”) and acquired \n94.81\n% of its outstanding shares as of December 31, 2022.  The shares were acquired through acceptances of the tender offer and a series of open market and over-the-counter purchases. PMI funded the acquisition through cash on-hand and debt proceeds, as described in Note 8. \nIndebtedness.  \nThe aggregate cash paid as of the acquisition date was $\n14,460\n million (or $\n13,976\n million net of cash acquired), which was included in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022.  The cash paid in connection with the additional purchases of the noncontrolling interests after the acquisition date and through December 31, 2022 amounted to $\n1,495\n million and was included in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022.   \n88\nIn accordance with the Swedish Companies Act, PMI subsequently exercised its right to initiate arbitral proceedings to compulsorily redeem the remaining shares for which acceptances were not received and obtained legal title to \n100\n% of the shares in Swedish Match on February 17, 2023. Cash paid in connection with such legal title, together with an immaterial amount attributable to open market purchases that were executed in December 2022 but settled in January 2023, amounted to $\n883\n million and was included in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023. While PMI paid the referenced amounts and acquired legal title to the shares, under the Swedish Companies Act the redemption process was not complete until the final redemption price was determined by an arbitral tribunal. On September 12, 2023, the arbitral tribunal determined the final redemption price to be Swedish krona (SEK) \n115.07\n, unchanged from the SEK \n115.07\n that PMI paid per share in connection with obtaining legal title to the shares. This process was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 when the opportunity to appeal the arbitral tribunal determination ended.\nSwedish Match is a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market.\n \nThe acquisition is accelerating PMI’s transformation to become a smoke-free company with a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine.  \nIn November 2023, PMI finalized all measurement period adjustments related to the Swedish Match acquisition.\n The table below summarizes the final purchase price allocation for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date: \n(in millions)\nFinal Purchase Price Allocation Recognized as of \nthe acquisition date \nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n484\n \nTrade receivables\n135\n \nOther receivables\n53\n \nInventories\n437\n \nOther current assets\n415\n \nProperty, plant and equipment\n677\n \nOther intangible assets \n7,868\n \nOther non-current assets\n216\n \nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n224\n \nAccounts payable\n120\n \nOther current liabilities\n532\n \nIncome taxes \n14\n \nLong-term debt\n1,121\n \nDeferred income taxes \n1,970\n \nOther non-current liabilities\n196\n \nIdentifiable net assets acquired\n6,108\n \nNoncontrolling interest\n2,379\n \nGoodwill \n10,731\n \nTotal consideration transferred\n$\n14,460\n \nThe total fair value step-up adjustment for inventories was $\n146\n million, of which $\n125\n million was recognized in cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the remaining balance in the first quarter of 2023.\nThe fair value of long-term debt was primarily determined using readily available market prices as of the acquisition date and the total purchase price adjustment of $(\n107\n) million is being amortized as an increase to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt.\nGoodwill is primarily attributable to future growth opportunities, anticipated synergies in the U.S. and intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition.  The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\n89\nIdentifiable intangible assets of Swedish Match consist of:\nType \nUseful Life\nEstimated Fair Value (in millions)\nTrademarks\nNon-amortizable\n$\n3,133\n \nTrademarks\nAmortizable\n20\n - \n30\n years\n1,067\n \nDeveloped technology, including patents\n10\n years\n113\n \nCustomer relationships\n6\n - \n15\n years\n3,555\n \nTotal identifiable intangible assets\n$\n7,868\n \nThe significant assumptions used in determining the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets included royalty rates, revenue growth rates, profit margins, customer attrition rates and discount rates.\nTrademarks primarily relate to $\n3,133\n million for the \nZYN\n trademark, which has been determined to have an indefinite life due to the fast growth and the leading position of the brand in the U.S. market.  All other trademarks have been determined to have a useful life ranging between \n20\n - \n30\n years. The trademarks have been valued using the relief from royalty method supported by revenue growth rate assumptions and royalty rates disaggregated at the individual trademark level.\nDeveloped technology, including patents, relates to the nicotine pouch technology of $\n113\n million.  These patents have been assigned a useful life of \n10\n years, which is in line with their protection period and have been valued using the comparable transactions and income methods.\nCustomer relationships have been valued by categories of customers and geographic locations, namely the U.S. market, Scandinavia, and other markets using the multiple periods excess earnings method. The significant assumptions included customer attrition rates disaggregated at the customer category level, the revenue growth rates, as well as profit margins.  \nPMI consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022, include $\n316\n million of net revenues and $(\n26\n) million of net losses associated with the results of operations of Swedish Match from the acquisition date to December 31, 2022. The operating results of Swedish Match are included in the Europe and Americas segments.\nAcquisition related transaction costs, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $\n59\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and were included in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings. Bridge and term loan credit agreement related fees associated with the issuance of debt amounted to $\n54\n million, of which $\n37\n million were capitalized at the acquisition date.  The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was based on the tender offer as of the acquisition date.\nUnder the EU Merger Regulation, approval by the European Commission of PMI's acquisition of Swedish Match was conditional on PMHH's divestiture of Swedish Match's subsidiary, SMD Logistics AB (\"SMDL\"), following the completion of the offer to tender all shares in Swedish Match to PMHH. As a result, these assets were accounted for as assets held for sale and included within other current assets and other accrued liabilities in PMI’s consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.  PMI subsequently sold SMDL on June 30, 2023 and the transaction did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of PMI and Swedish Match. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2021, as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect the following:\n•\nincremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the current fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired;\n•\nincremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory; \n•\nadditional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition, including the effects of the related derivative financial instruments designated to hedge interest rate risks as well as economic hedges;\n•\nreclassification of non-recurring acquisition-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, to the year ended December 31, 2021;\n•\nimpact of a deferred tax cost of $\n430\n million in 2022 and $\n321\n million in 2021 related to the theoretical unrealized foreign currency gains on intercompany loans related to the acquisition financing. These theoretical unrealized pre-tax foreign currency movements were fully offset in the consolidated statements of earnings and were reflected as currency translation adjustments in \n90\nPMI's consolidated statements of stockholders' (deficit) equity, while the corresponding deferred tax impacts were reflected in PMI's consolidated statements of earnings; and\n•\nother immaterial items (i.e., the alignment of accounting policies from IFRS to US GAAP.)\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company, nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows:\n(in millions)\n2022\nNet revenues\n$\n33,579\n \nNet earnings attributable to PMI\n$\n8,779\n \nTransactions With Noncontrolling Interests  \nTurkey\n – In the first quarter of 2022, PMI acquired the remaining \n25\n% stake of its holding in Philip Morris Tütün Mamulleri Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş. (\"PMTM\") (formerly Philsa Philip Morris Sabanci Sigara ve Tütüncülük Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş.) and \n24.75\n% stake in Philip Morris Pazarlama ve Satiş A.Ş. (\"PMPS\") (formerly Philip Morris SA, Philip Morris Sabanci Pazarlama ve Satiş A.Ş.) from its Turkish partners, Sabanci Holding for a total acquisition price including transaction costs and remaining dividend entitlements of approximately $\n223\n million. As a result of this acquisition, PMI owned \n100\n% of these Turkish subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022. The purchase of the remaining stakes in these holdings resulted in a decrease to PMI's additional paid-in capital of $\n30\n million and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive losses of $\n171\n million primarily following the reclassification of accumulated currency translation losses from noncontrolling interests to PMI’s accumulated other comprehensive losses during the first quarter of 2022.\nIn January 2023, PMI sold the acquired stakes of its holdings in PMTM and PMPS to Pioneers Tutun Yatirim Anonim Sirketi (“Pioneers”) for a consideration of approximately $\n258\n million, including transaction costs and dividend entitlements.  The sale resulted in an increase to PMI's additional paid-in capital of $\n36\n million and a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive losses of $\n179\n million, following the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from PMI’s accumulated other comprehensive losses to noncontrolling interests.\n \nNote 4.\nWar in Ukraine: \nSince the onset of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, PMI's main priority has been the safety and security of its employees and their families in the country. \nUkraine\nPMI temporarily suspended its commercial and manufacturing operations in Ukraine, including the closing of its factory in Kharkiv at the end of February 2022, in order to preserve the safety of its employees. PMI subsequently resumed commercial activities in select locations where safety allowed, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and began to supply the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement.  Production at the factory in Kharkiv remains suspended.   PMI is not aware of any major damage to its production facilities, inventories or other assets in Ukraine. On June 20, 2023, PMI announced the investment of $\n30\n million in a new production facility in the Lviv region, in Western Ukraine. In the fourth quarter of 2023, as a result of the completion of certain preparatory work for this new production facility, PMI recorded impairment of certain long-lived assets. The new production facility was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2024 and local production commenced in April 2024. As of December 31, 2024, PMI’s Ukrainian operations had approximately $\n562\n million in total assets, excluding intercompany balances.  These total assets included $\n105\n million and $\n396\n million in receivables and inventories, respectively.\n91\nRussia \nPMI has suspended its planned investments in the Russian Federation including all new product launches and commercial, innovation, and manufacturing investments. PMI has also taken steps to scale down its manufacturing operations in Russia amid ongoing supply chain disruptions and the evolving regulatory environment. PMI is continuously assessing the evolving situation in Russia. This includes regulatory constraints in the market entailing very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities, and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In the event of a divestment, PMI's ability to fully realize the value of the business would likely be subject to material impairment. As a result of PMI continuing operations within Russia in 2023 and 2024, it has not recorded an impairment of long-lived and other assets.  However, PMI recorded specific asset write downs in 2022 as referred to in the table below. PMI’s Russian operations as of December 31, 2024 had approximately $\n2.7\n billion in total assets, excluding intercompany balances. These total assets included $\n1,038\n million, $\n426\n million, $\n789\n million, $\n219\n million and $\n154\n million in cash (primarily held in local currency), receivables, inventories, property, plant and equipment and goodwill, respectively.  In addition, there was approximately $\n1,585\n million of cumulative foreign currency translation losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive losses in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, we hold a \n23\n% equity interest in JSC TK Megapolis, PMI's distributor in Russia. For further details, see Note 6. \nRelated Parties – Equity Investments and Other\n.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, PMI did not incur charges related to circumstances driven by the war. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, PMI recorded in its consolidated statements of earnings pre-tax charges related to circumstances driven by the war as follows: \n(in millions)\n2023\n2022\nCost of sales\nMarketing, administration and research costs\nTotal\nCost of sales\nMarketing, administration and research costs\nTotal\nUkraine \n1\n$\n15\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n53\n \n$\n42\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n78\n \nRussia \n2\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n20\n \n53\n \n73\n \nTotal\n$\n15\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n53\n \n$\n62\n \n$\n89\n \n$\n151\n \n1\n The 2023 pre-tax charges were primarily due to the cost of PMI’s humanitarian efforts, which includes salary continuation for its employees, severance payments, as well as an impairment of certain long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of 2023. The 2022 pre-tax charges were primarily due to an inventory write-down, additional allowance for receivables and the cost of PMI’s humanitarian efforts, which includes salary continuation for its employees.  \n2\n The 2022 pre-tax charges were primarily due to machinery and inventory write downs related to the commercial decisions noted above.\nPMI will continue to monitor the situation as it evolves and will determine if further charges are needed.\n92\nNote 5.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net:  \nGoodwill\nThe movements in goodwill were as follows: \n(in millions)\nEurope\nSSEA, CIS & MEA\nEA, AU & PMI DF\nAmericas\nWellness & Healthcare\nTotal\nBalances at January 1, 2023\n$\n4,774\n \n$\n2,869\n \n$\n493\n \n$\n10,507\n \n$\n1,012\n \n$\n19,655\n \nChanges due to:\nImpairment\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n665\n)\n(\n665\n)\nCurrency\n220\n \n8\n \n(\n1\n)\n89\n \n43\n \n359\n \nMeasurement period adjustments\n(\n821\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1,749\n)\n—\n \n(\n2,570\n)\nBalances, December 31,  2023\n4,173\n \n2,877\n \n492\n \n8,847\n \n390\n \n16,779\n \nChanges due to:\nAcquisitions and divestitures\n—\n \n512\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n65\n)\n447\n \nCurrency\n(\n360\n)\n(\n138\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n98\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n626\n)\nBalances, December 31, 2024\n$\n3,813\n \n$\n3,251\n \n$\n470\n \n$\n8,749\n \n$\n317\n \n$\n16,600\n \nAs discussed in Note 1. \nBackground and Basis of Presentation\n, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into its existing geographical segments. As a result, the January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023 goodwill balances in the table above included the reclassifications of the former Swedish Match segment to the Europe and Americas segments. \nThe decrease in goodwill in 2023 was primarily due to the measurement period adjustments to the Swedish Match final purchase price allocation (see Note 3, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n), coupled with the impairment discussed below and partially offset by currency movements.\nThe decrease in goodwill in 2024 was due to currency movements and goodwill allocated to disposal group in relation to Vectura Group' sale, partially offset by the preliminary purchase price allocation of PMI's acquisition in Egypt of United Tobacco Company in the second quarter of 2024. For further details on the acquisition in Egypt and Vectura Group's sale, see Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n.  \nAt December 31, 2024, goodwill primarily reflects PMI’s acquisitions of Swedish Match AB and Fertin Pharma A/S, as well as acquisitions in Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines and Serbia.\n93\nOther Intangible Assets\nDetails of other intangible assets were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in millions)\nWeighted-Average Remaining Useful Life\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet\nNon-amortizable intangible assets\n$\n4,446\n \n$\n4,446\n \n$\n4,543\n \n$\n4,543\n \nAmortizable intangible assets:\nTrademarks\n15\n years\n2,134\n \n$\n850\n \n1,284\n \n2,267\n \n$\n784\n \n1,483\n \nReacquired commercialization rights for \nIQOS \nin the U.S.\n4\n years\n2,777\n \n370\n \n2,407\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDeveloped technology, including patents\n7\n years\n320\n \n121\n \n199\n \n774\n \n329\n \n445\n \nCustomer relationships and other\n11\n years\n3,712\n \n721\n \n2,991\n \n3,843\n \n450\n \n3,393\n \nTotal other intangible assets\n$\n13,389\n \n$\n2,062\n \n$\n11,327\n \n$\n11,427\n \n$\n1,563\n \n$\n9,864\n \n \nNon-amortizable intangible assets substantially consist of the \nZYN\n trademarks and other trademarks related to acquisitions in Indonesia and Mexico, as well as the tobacco manufacturing license associated with the preliminary purchase price allocation of PMI's acquisition in Egypt in the second quarter of 2024 (see Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures \nfor further details). The decrease since December 31, 2023, was mainly due to currency movements of $\n276\n million and a pre-tax impairment charge in the first quarter of 2024 of $\n27\n million primarily for an in-process research and development project in the Wellness and Healthcare segment. The pre-tax impairment charge of $\n27\n million was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs on PMI's consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. The decrease was partially offset by the recognition of the Egyptian tobacco manufacturing license.\nThe increase in the gross carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets from December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the classification of the \nIQOS\n commercialization rights in the U.S. on the acquisition date (May 1, 2024) as Other intangible assets, net (see Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n), partially offset by developed technology assets of $\n454\n million allocated to disposal group  in relation to Vectura Group's sale (see Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n) and currency movements of $\n269\n million.  \nThe change in the accumulated amortization from December 31, 2023, was mainly due to the 2024 amortization of $\n835\n million, partially offset by accumulated amortization of developed technology assets of $\n267\n million allocated to disposal group in relation to Vectura Group's sale and currency movements of $\n69\n million. The amortization of intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2024 was recorded in cost of sales ($\n51\n million) and in marketing, administration and research costs ($\n784\n million) on PMI's consolidated statements of earnings.\nAmortization expense on a pre-tax basis for each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $\n991\n million or less, assuming no additional transactions occur that require the amortization of intangible assets. This amount includes amortization of \nIQOS \ncommercialization rights in the U.S. (see Note 3, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n).\n \n94\n2024 Annual impairment review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets   \nDuring the second quarter of 2024, PMI completed its annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment using a quantitative assessment for all of its reporting units and non-amortizable intangible assets. As a result of this review, \nno\n impairment charges were required.  Each of PMI's reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values with the exception of the Wellness & Healthcare reporting unit, which had less than \n20\n% excess of fair value over its carrying value. PMI will continue to monitor this reporting unit as any changes in assumptions and estimates, unfavorable clinical trial results, failure to obtain regulatory approvals or other market factors could result in additional future goodwill and other intangible asset impairments. In addition, there are still risks related to PMI’s Russian reporting unit’s assets as the fair value of these assets is difficult to predict due to the current economic, political, regulatory and social conditions as well as the foreign currency volatility.  As of December 31, 2024, our Russian operations had approximately $\n2.7\n billion in total assets, excluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $\n1.0\n billion consisted of cash and cash equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles). Additionally, we hold a \n23\n% equity interest in JSC TK Megapolis, PMI's distributor in Russia. For further details, see Note 4. \nWar in Ukraine\n, Note 6. \nRelated Parties – Equity Investments and Other\n, and Note 18. \nContingencies\n.\n2023 Annual impairment review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets   \nDuring the second quarter of 2023, as a result of the completion of PMI's annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment, it was determined that the estimated fair value of the Wellness and Healthcare reporting unit was lower than its carrying value. Consequently, PMI recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n665\n million in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting the impact of reduced estimated future cash flows, which were primarily attributable to unfavorable clinical trial results that became available in June 2023 for an inhalable aspirin product being developed by the Wellness and Healthcare business. Additionally, as a result of the impairment test of non-amortizable intangible assets, PMI recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $\n15\n million for an in-process research and development project related to one of PMI's 2021 acquisitions. This pre-tax impairment charge of $\n15\n million was recorded within marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNote 6.\nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other: \nEquity Method Investments:\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, PMI had total equity method investments of $\n1,005\n million and $\n1,309\n million, respectively. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost. Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is adjusted for PMI's proportionate share of earnings or losses, dividends, capital contributions, changes in ownership interests and movements in currency translation adjustments.  The carrying value of our equity method investments at December 31, 2024 and 2023, exceeded our share of the investees' book value by $\n1,060\n million and $\n907\n million, respectively. The difference between the investment carrying value and the amount of underlying equity in net assets is mainly attributable to equity method goodwill, convertible debt instruments, and definite-lived intangible assets and other assets. The difference related to the definite-lived intangibles and other assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 of $\n152\n million and $\n31\n million, respectively, is amortized on a straight-line basis and is included in Equity investments and securities (income)/loss, net on the consolidated statements of earnings. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, PMI received year-to-date dividends from equity method investees of $\n151\n million and $\n57\n million, respectively.\nPMI holds a \n23\n% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V. (\"MDBV\"), which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia (SSEA, CIS & MEA segment), which as of December 31, 2024 had a carrying value of $\n264\n million. Additionally, there was approximately $\n633\n million of cumulative foreign currency translation losses associated with MDBV reflected in accumulated other comprehensive losses in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2024.  In June 2024, the Russian government included JSC TK Megapolis in the list of economically significant organizations that may be subject to forced localization under applicable Russian law, which refers to the mandatory removal of a foreign holding company from the shareholding structure. On August 8, 2024, the Arbitrazh Court of the Moscow Region granted the forced localization of MDBV as requested by the Ministry of Industry and Trade on July 18, 2024.  As a result, MDBV’s shares in JSC TK Megapolis were transferred to JSC TK Megapolis and subsequently transferred to the Russian subsidiary of its indirect shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result of the transfer of shares, PMI recorded a tax charge of $\n77\n million, primarily reflecting additional deferred withholding taxes related to the JSC TK Megapolis pre-localization earnings and other adjustments of accumulated earnings of the Russian subsidiary.  As of December 31, 2024, there are risks related to this investment as the fair value of these assets with their associated rights is difficult to predict due to the current economic, political, regulatory, legal and social conditions as well as the foreign currency volatility.  \n \n95\nPMI holds a \n49\n% equity interest in United Arab Emirates-based Emirati Investors-TA (FZC) (“EITA”).  PMI holds an approximate \n25\n% economic interest in Société des Tabacs Algéro-Emiratie (“STAEM”), an Algerian joint venture that is \n51\n% owned by EITA and \n49\n% by the Algerian state-owned enterprise Management et Développement des Actifs et des Ressources Holding (\"MADAR Holding\"), which manufactures and distributes under license some of PMI’s brands (SSEA, CIS & MEA segment). \nIn April 2023, PMI acquired an approximate economic interest of \n25\n% in United Tobacco Company (\"UTC\"). UTC is an entity incorporated in Egypt which manufactures products under license for PMI’s Egyptian subsidiary. On May 16, 2024, PMI acquired a controlling interest in UTC. For further details, see Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n. \nIn May 2024, PMI acquired an indirect economic interest of \n14.7\n% in Eastern Company (“Eastern\"), Egypt’s largest cigarette manufacturer which also includes cigars and pipe tobacco, among others, in its portfolio. PMI accounted for its investment in Eastern under the equity method of accounting as it has the indirect ability to participate in Eastern's policy making processes.  In relation to the acquisition, PMI subsequently entered into an agreement in August 2024 to guarantee certain credit facilities and repayment of certain bank loan liabilities. The maximum amount of these guarantee obligations is $\n385\n million and they will be in effect until 2034. As of December 31, 2024, PMI has not finalized the basis difference allocation resulting from the investment.  \nThe initial investments in Megapolis Distribution BV, EITA, Eastern and UTC (up to the acquisition of controlling interest in UTC on May 16, 2024) have been recorded at cost and are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets. Transactions between these equity method investees and PMI subsidiaries are considered to be related-party transactions and are included in the tables below. \n \nEquity securities:\nOn March 22, 2019, PMI’s wholly owned subsidiary in Canada, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (“RBH”) obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court under the CCAA and the oversight provided by the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI determined that it no longer had a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing. \nSince the deconsolidation of RBH on March 22, 2019, PMI has accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value, and recorded its continuing investment in RBH at fair value of $\n3,280\n million, which included the estimated settlement amount at the date of deconsolidation, within equity investments.  \nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement (“Proposed Plan”) setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD \n32.5\n billion (approximately $\n22.3\n billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD \n32.5\n billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.  \nThere has been no agreed allocation under the Proposed Plan and there has been no ruling from the CCAA court on the matter. On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Note 18. \nContingencies\n). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate settlement amount of CAD \n32.5\n billion among RBH, ITL, and JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI’s investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result, PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n2,316\n million in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event. The fair value of PMI’s continuing investment in RBH of $\n714\n million represented the estimated fair value of the underlying business, net of PMI’s best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis. \nIn determining the fair value of PMI’s investment in RBH, PMI made various judgements, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada. In addition, significant estimates were made with respect to the allocation amount of the aggregate global \n96\nsettlement amount among RBH, ITL and JTIM, as well as the deductibility of the settlement amount payment for income tax purposes in Canada. All significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy. Transactions between PMI and RBH are considered to be related-party transactions from the date of deconsolidation and are included in the tables below. \nThe fair value of PMI’s other equity securities, which have been classified within Level 1, was $\n921\n million and $\n375\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Unrealized pre-tax gains (losses) of $\n546\n million and $\n49\n million ($\n418\n million and $\n38\n million net of tax) on these equity securities were recorded in equity investments and securities (income)/loss, net on the consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  For a description of the fair value hierarchy and the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values, see Note 2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n. \nOther related parties:\nUnited Arab Emirates-based Trans-Emirates Trading and Investments (FZC) (\"TTI\") holds a \n33\n% non-controlling interest in Philip Morris Misr LLC (\"PMM\"), an entity incorporated in Egypt which is consolidated in PMI’s financial statements in the SSEA, CIS & MEA segment. PMM sells, under license, PMI brands in Egypt through an exclusive distribution agreement with a local entity that is also controlled by TTI. \nGodfrey Phillips India Ltd (\"GPI\") is one of the non-controlling interest holders in IPM India, which is a \n56.3\n% owned PMI consolidated subsidiary in the SSEA, CIS & MEA segment.  GPI also acts as contract manufacturer and distributor for IPM India.  \nFinancial activity with the above related parties:\nPMI’s net revenues and expenses with the above related parties were as follows: \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet revenues:\nMegapolis Group\n$\n2,393\n \n$\n2,267\n \n$\n2,485\n \nOther\n1,483\n \n1,286\n \n1,173\n \nNet revenues \n(a)\n$\n3,876\n \n$\n3,553\n \n$\n3,658\n \nExpenses:\nOther\n$\n101\n \n$\n186\n \n$\n119\n \nExpenses\n$\n101\n \n$\n186\n \n$\n119\n \n(a)\n Net revenues exclude excise taxes and VAT billed to customers.  \nPMI’s balance sheet activity with the above related parties was as follows: \nAt December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nReceivables:\nMegapolis Group\n$\n405\n \n$\n474\n \nOther\n286\n \n236\n \nReceivables\n$\n691\n \n$\n710\n \nPayables:\nOther\n$\n60\n \n$\n18\n \nPayables\n$\n60\n \n$\n18\n \n \nThe activities with the above related parties are in the ordinary course of business, and are primarily for distribution, service fees, contract manufacturing and license agreements.  PMI eliminated its respective share of all significant intercompany transactions with the equity method investees.\n \n97\nNote 7.\nProduct Warranty: \nPMI's heat-not-burn devices and e-vapor products are subject to standard product warranties generally for a period of \n12\n months from the date of purchase or such other periods as required by law.  PMI generally provides in cost of sales for the estimated cost of warranty in the period the related revenue is recognized.  PMI assesses the adequacy of its accrued product warranties and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.  Factors that affect product warranties may vary across markets but typically include device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies.  PMI accounts for its product warranties within other accrued liabilities.  \nAt December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these amounts were as follows:\nAt December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nBalance at beginning of period\n$\n80\n \n$\n104\n \nChanges due to:  \n   Warranties issued\n76\n \n60\n \n    Settlements \n(\n77\n)\n(\n83\n)\n    Currency/Other\n(\n3\n)\n(\n1\n)\nBalance at end of period\n$\n76\n \n$\n80\n \nNote 8.\nIndebtedness:\nShort-Term Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, PMI’s short-term borrowings and related average interest rates consisted of the following:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in millions)\nAmount Outstanding\nAverage Year-End Rate\nAmount Outstanding\nAverage Year-End Rate\nCommercial paper\n$\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n$\n1,685\n \n5.6\n \n%\nBank loans\n137\n \n8.6\n \n283\n \n8.9\n \n$\n137\n \n$\n1,968\n \nGiven the mix of PMI's legal entities and their respective local economic environments, the average interest rate for bank loans above can vary significantly from day to day and country to country.\nThe fair values of PMI’s short-term borrowings at December 31, 2024 and 2023, based on current market interest rates, approximate carrying value.\n98\nLong-Term Debt\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, PMI’s long-term debt consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nU.S. dollar notes, \n0.875\n% to \n6.375\n% (average interest rate \n4.592\n%), due through 2044\n$\n35,297\n \n$\n30,272\n \nForeign currency obligations:\nEuro notes, \n0.125\n% to \n3.750\n% (average interest rate \n2.062\n%), due through 2039\n7,082\n \n8,526\n \nSwiss franc note, \n1.625\n%, due 2024\n—\n \n299\n \nEuro credit facility borrowings related to Swedish Match AB acquisition, (average interest rate \n3.445\n%), due through 2027\n2,610\n \n6,121\n \nSwedish krona notes, \n1.395\n% to \n2.710\n% (average interest rate \n2.016\n%), due through 2029\n218\n \n236\n \nOther (average interest rate \n5.378\n%), due through 2032 \n(a) \n351\n \n487\n \nCarrying value of long-term debt\n45,558\n \n45,941\n \nLess current portion of long-term debt\n3,392\n \n4,698\n \n$\n42,166\n \n$\n41,243\n \n(a)\n Includes long-term bank loans at subsidiaries, as well as $\n67\n million and $\n53\n million in finance leases at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nThe fair value of PMI’s outstanding long-term debt, which is utilized solely for disclosure purposes, is determined using quotes and market interest rates currently available to PMI for issuances of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023 the fair value of PMI's outstanding long-term debt, excluding the aforementioned finance leases, was as follows:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nLevel 1\n$\n41,431\n \n$\n38,259\n \nLevel 2\n3,011\n \n6,687\n \nFor a description of the fair value hierarchy and the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values, see Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.\nTerm Loan Facility related to the Financing of the Swedish Match Acquisition  \nOn June 23, 2022, PMI entered into a €\n5.5\n billion (approximately $\n5.8\n billion at the date of signing) senior unsecured term loan credit agreement consisting of a €\n3.0\n billion (approximately $\n3.2\n billion at the date of signing) tranche expiring \nthree years\n after the occurrence of certain events and a €\n2.5\n billion (approximately $\n2.6\n billion at the date of signing) tranche expiring on June 23, 2027.\nOn November 7, 2022, PMI delivered notices of borrowing for advances totaling €\n5.5\n billion under the term loan facility, of which €\n3.0\n billion would become due on November 9, 2025, and €\n2.5\n billion would become due on June 23, 2027, unless prepaid pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement.\nOn November 21, 2024, PMI prepaid approximately €\n3\n billion (approximately $\n3.2\n billion), including outstanding principal and accrued interest, representing all borrowings outstanding under the \n3\n-year tranche of the senior unsecured term loan facility.

From July 22, 2021 through March 31, 2022, PMI repurchased \n10.5\n million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $\n1.0\n billion. During the first three months of 2022, PMI repurchased \n2.0\n million shares of its common stock at a cost of $\n199\n million. On May 11, 2022, we announced the suspension of the \nthree-year\n share repurchase program following the recommended public offer to acquire the outstanding shares of Swedish Match from its shareholders. For further details, see Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures. \nPrior to the suspension of the program, PMI made no share repurchases during the second quarter of 2022. The \nthree-year\n share repurchase program expired on July 21, 2024.\nAt December 31, 2024, \n27,288,770\n shares of common stock were reserved for stock awards under PMI’s stock plans, and \n250\n million shares of preferred stock, without par value, were authorized but unissued.  PMI currently has no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nNote 10.\nStock Plans: \nIn May 2022, PMI’s shareholders approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2022 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”).   Under the 2022 Plan, PMI may grant to eligible employees restricted shares and restricted share units, performance-based cash incentive awards and performance-based equity awards.  Up to \n25\n million shares of PMI’s common stock may be issued under the 2022 Plan.  At December 31, 2024, shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan were \n19,189,876\n.\nIn May 2017, PMI’s shareholders approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2017 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan”).  A non-employee director is defined as a member of the PMI Board of Directors who is not a full-time employee of PMI or of any corporation in which PMI owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing at least \n50\n% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors in such corporation.  Up to \n1\n million shares of PMI common stock may be awarded under the 2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan.  At December 31, 2024, shares available for grant under the plan were \n855,920\n.\nRestricted share unit (RSU) awards\nPMI may grant RSU awards to eligible employees; recipients may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such awards. Such awards are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. RSU awards generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.  RSU awards do not carry voting rights, although they do earn dividend equivalents. \n103\nDuring 2024, the activity for RSU awards was as follows:\nNumber of \nShares\nWeighted- \nAverage Grant \nDate Fair Value \nPer Share\nBalance at January 1, 2024\n4,603,321\n \n$\n96.38\n \nGranted\n2,013,350\n \n89.71\n \nVested\n(\n1,849,088\n)\n85.57\n \nForfeited\n(\n224,929\n)\n97.43\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n4,542,654\n \n$\n97.78\n \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the grant date fair value of the RSU awards granted to PMI employees and the recorded compensation expense related to RSU awards were as follows:\n(in millions, except per RSU award granted)\nTotal Grant Date Fair Value of RSU Awards Granted\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU Award Granted\nCompensation Expense related to RSU Awards\n2024\n$\n181\n \n$\n89.71\n \n$\n157\n \n2023\n$\n179\n \n$\n101.96\n \n$\n153\n \n2022\n$\n174\n \n$\n104.75\n \n$\n135\n \nThe fair value of the RSU awards at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the restriction period, typically \nthree years\n after the date of the award, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of \n58\n. As of December 31, 2024, PMI had $\n154\n million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested RSU awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of  approximately \nseventeen months\n, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of \n58\n. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, share and fair value information for PMI RSU awards that vested were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\nShares of RSU Awards that Vested\nGrant Date Fair Value of Vested Shares of RSU Awards\nTotal Fair Value of RSU Awards that Vested\n2024\n1,849,088\n \n$\n158\n \n$\n171\n \n2023\n1,483,356\n \n$\n129\n \n$\n148\n \n2022\n1,603,571\n \n$\n126\n \n$\n174\n \n104\nPerformance share unit (PSU) awards\nPMI may grant PSU awards to certain executives; recipients may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such awards.  The PSU awards require the achievement of certain performance metrics, which are predetermined at the time of grant, typically over a \nthree-year\n performance cycle.  The performance metrics for such PSU's granted during 2023 and 2022 consisted of PMI's Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") relative to a predetermined peer group and on an absolute basis (\n40\n% weight), PMI’s currency-neutral compound annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth rate (\n30\n% weight), and a Sustainability Index, which consists of \ntwo\n drivers: \n•\nPro\nduct Sustainability\n (\n20\n% weight) measuring progress primarily on PMI's efforts to maximize the benefits of smoke-free products, purposefully phase out cigarettes, and reduce post-consumer waste; and\n•\nOperational Sustainability\n (\n10\n% weight) measuring progress on PMI's efforts to benefit PMI and its stakeholders by tackling climate change, preserving nature, improving the quality of life of people in its supply chain, and fostering an empowered, and inclusive workplace. \nThe performance metrics, targets and relative weights for the PSU’s granted during 2024 were the same as the PSU’s granted during 2023 and 2022, with the exception of adjustments made to certain components of the Sustainability Index intended to address PMI's developing sustainability strategy and reporting.\nThe PSU performance metrics may be adjusted if appropriate to reflect the impact of unusual or infrequently occurring events, including, to the extent significant, corporate transactions, accounting or tax law changes, asset write-downs, litigation or claim adjustments, foreign exchange gains and losses, unbudgeted capital expenditures and other such events. \nThe aggregate of the weighted performance factors for the \nthree\n metrics in each such PSU award determines the percentage of PSUs that will vest at the end of the \nthree-year\n performance cycle. The minimum percentage of such PSUs that can vest is \nzero\n, with a target percentage of \n100\n and a maximum percentage of \n200\n. Each such vested PSU entitles the participant to \none\n share of common stock.  An aggregate weighted PSU performance factor of \n100\n will result in the targeted number of PSUs being vested.  At the end of the performance cycle, participants are entitled to an amount equivalent to the accumulated dividends paid on common stock during the performance cycle for the number of shares earned.  PSU awards do not carry voting rights. \nDuring 2024, the activity for PSU awards was as follows: \nNumber of \nShares\nWeighted- \nAverage PSU Grant Date \nFair Value Subject to Other Performance Factors \nWeighted- \nAverage PSU Grant Date \nFair Value Subject to TSR Performance Factors \n(Per Share)\n(Per Share)\nBalance at January 1, 2024\n1,427,280\n \n$\n95.45\n \n$\n126.86\n \nGranted\n543,560\n \n89.01\n \n85.72\n \nVested\n(\n916,452\n)\n82.28\n \n107.69\n \nAdjustments for performance achievement\n374,402\n \n82.17\n \n107.70\n \nForfeited\n(\n78,630\n)\n97.42\n \n117.24\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n1,350,160\n \n$\n98.00\n \n$\n118.55\n \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the grant date fair value of the PSU awards granted to PMI employees and the recorded compensation expense related to PSU awards were as follows: \n105\n(in millions, except per PSU award granted)\nWeighted- \nAverage PSU Grant Date \nFair Value Subject to Other Performance Factors \nWeighted- \nAverage PSU Grant Date \nFair Value Subject to TSR Performance Factors \nCompensation Expense related to PSU Awards\nTotal \nPer PSU Award\nTotal\nPer PSU Award\nTotal\n2024\n$\n29\n \n$\n89.01\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n85.72\n \n$\n70\n \n2023\n$\n29\n \n$\n102.02\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n133.54\n \n$\n59\n \n2022\n$\n30\n \n$\n104.92\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n143.89\n \n$\n48\n \nThe grant date fair value of the PSU awards subject to the other performance factors was determined by using the market price of PMI’s stock on the date of the grant.

As of December 31, 2024, PMI had $\n31\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSU awards. This cost is recognized over a weighted-average performance cycle period of approximately \nseventeen months\n, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of \n58\n. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, share and fair value information for PMI PSU awards that vested were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\nShares of PSU Awards that Vested\nGrant Date Fair Value of Vested Shares of PSU Awards\nTotal Fair Value of PSU Awards that Vested\n2024\n916,452\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n83\n \n2023\n902,232\n \n$\n83\n \n$\n91\n \n2022\n669,960\n \n$\n54\n \n$\n74\n \nNote 11.\nEarnings per Share:\nUnvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and therefore are included in PMI’s earnings per share calculation pursuant to the two-class method.\n106\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) were calculated using the following:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet earnings attributable to PMI\n$\n7,057\n \n$\n7,813\n \n$\n9,048\n \nLess distributed and undistributed earnings attributable to share-based payment awards \n(1)\n23\n \n22\n \n24\n \nNet earnings for basic and diluted EPS\n$\n7,034\n \n$\n7,791\n \n$\n9,024\n \nWeighted-average shares for basic EPS\n1,554\n \n1,552\n \n1,550\n \nPlus contingently issuable performance stock units (PSUs) \n(1)\n2\n \n1\n \n2\n \nWeighted-average shares for diluted EPS\n1,556\n \n1,553\n \n1,552\n \n(1)\n Including rounding adjustment\nFor the 2024, 2023 and 2022 computations, there were \nno\n antidilutive stock awards.\n \nNote 12.\nIncome Taxes:  \nEarnings before income taxes and provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEarnings before income taxes\n$\n12,199\n \n$\n10,450\n \n$\n11,634\n \nProvision for income taxes:\nUnited States federal and state:\nCurrent\n$\n465\n \n$\n201\n \n$\n(\n75\n)\nDeferred\n(\n81\n)\n(\n368\n)\n(\n139\n)\nTotal United States\n384\n \n(\n167\n)\n(\n214\n)\nOutside United States:\nCurrent\n2,668\n \n2,468\n \n2,553\n \nDeferred\n(\n35\n)\n38\n \n(\n95\n)\nTotal outside United States\n2,633\n \n2,506\n \n2,458\n \nTotal provision for income taxes\n$\n3,017\n \n$\n2,339\n \n$\n2,244\n \nChanges in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.  Many countries have enacted the OECD’s framework on a global minimum tax (referred to as “Pillar Two”), effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2023. PMI has determined that Pillar Two did not have a material impact on its 2024 consolidated financial statements.\nAt December 31, 2017, PMI recorded a one-time transition tax liability on its accumulated foreign earnings, which is payable over an eight-year period beginning in 2018. At December 31, 2023, $\n0.3\n billion of PMI's remaining long-term portion of transition tax liability was recorded in \"income taxes and other liabilities\" on PMI's consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024, PMI had \nno\n remaining long-term portion of transition tax liability as the final transition tax payment is anticipated to be made in the second quarter of 2025.  \n107\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, applicable U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on approximately $\n1.6\n billion and $\n0.6\n billion, respectively, of accumulated earnings of Swedish Match U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be permanently reinvested.  PMI does not foresee a need to repatriate these earnings since its U.S. cash requirements are supported by distributions of earnings from PMI foreign entities that have not been designated as permanently reinvested and existing credit facilities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, PMI has determined the amount of deferred tax liabilities related to these unremitted Swedish Match U.S. earnings was approximately $\n192\n million and $\n71\n million, respectively. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, U.S. federal and foreign deferred income taxes have been provided on all accumulated earnings of PMI's foreign subsidiaries.  \nPMI is regularly examined by tax authorities around the world and is currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions.  The U.S. federal statute of limitations on assessment remains open for the years 2019 and onward. Foreign and U.S. state jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from \n3\n to \n5\n years after the filing of a return. Years still open to examination by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include Germany (2018 onward), Indonesia (2019 onward), Italy (2019 onward), Russia (2021 onward) and Switzerland (2020 onward). \n \nSubsidiaries of PMI in Indonesia, principally PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna Tbk (\"HMS\"), have recorded income tax receivables in the amount of \n4.0\n trillion Indonesian rupiah (approximately $\n249\n million) relating to corporate income tax assessments paid to avoid potential penalties, primarily for domestic and other intercompany transactions for the years 2015 to 2021. Objection letters have been filed with the Tax Office and these assessments are being challenged at various levels in court. These income tax receivables are included in other assets in PMI’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nIt is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close, which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties.  An estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at January 1,\n$\n55\n \n$\n72\n \n$\n89\n \nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n6\n \n7\n \n12\n \nAdditions for tax positions of previous years\n1\n \n1\n \n2\n \nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n—\n \n(\n23\n)\n(\n18\n)\nReductions due to lapse of statute of limitations\n(\n2\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n6\n)\nSettlements\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n4\n)\nOther\n(\n4\n)\n1\n \n(\n3\n)\nBalance at December 31,\n$\n56\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n72\n \nUnrecognized tax benefits and PMI’s liability for contingent income taxes, interest and penalties were as follows:\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nUnrecognized tax benefits\n$\n56\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n72\n \nAccrued interest and penalties\n11\n \n9\n \n13\n \nTax credits and other indirect benefits\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n3\n)\nLiability for tax contingencies\n$\n66\n \n$\n63\n \n$\n82\n \nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was $\n56\n million at December 31, 2024. The remainder, if recognized, would principally affect deferred taxes.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, PMI recognized income (expense) in its consolidated statements of earnings of $(\n2\n) million, $\n5\n million and $\n2\n million, respectively, related to interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions.\n108\nThe effective income tax rate on pre-tax earnings differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the following reasons for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nU.S. federal statutory rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nIncrease (decrease) resulting from:\nForeign rate differences\n(\n1.6\n)\n(\n1.0\n)\n(\n0.5\n)\nDividend repatriation cost\n0.6\n \n0.7\n \n0.6\n \nGlobal intangible low-taxed income\n1.7\n \n2.0\n \n1.0\n \nU.S. state taxes\n0.6\n \n(\n0.1\n)\n0.1\n \nForeign derived intangible income\n(\n0.7\n)\n(\n0.9\n)\n(\n0.8\n)\nForeign exchange\n1.7\n \n(\n1.6\n)\n(\n1.7\n)\nNon-deductible goodwill impairment\n—\n \n1.3\n \n—\n \nUnremitted earnings of Russian subsidiaries\n0.6\n \n1.7\n \n—\n \nFair value adjustment of equity securities\n1.1\n \n0.1\n \n0.1\n \nOther\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n0.8\n)\n(\n0.5\n)\nEffective tax rate\n24.7\n \n%\n22.4\n \n%\n19.3\n \n%\nThe 2024 effective tax rate increased \n2.3\n percentage points to \n24.7\n%. The change in the effective tax rate for 2024, as compared to 2023, was unfavorably impacted by: (i) an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to the fair value adjustment of equity securities held by PMI; (ii) U.S. state taxes; and (iii) a deferred tax charge for unrealized foreign currency losses on intercompany loans related to the Swedish Match acquisition financing reflected in the  consolidated statements of earnings, while the underlying pre-tax foreign currency movements fully offset in the consolidated statements of earnings and were reflected as currency translation adjustments in its consolidated statements of stockholders' (deficit) equity, partially offset by: (i) a lower deferred tax charge in 2024 related to the unremitted earnings of PMI's Russian subsidiaries as compared to the 2023 charge following the suspension of certain double tax treaties; (ii) the non-deductible Wellness and Healthcare goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2023; and (iii) a U.S. tax benefit for a worthless stock deduction under section 165(g) of the Internal Revenue Code related to PMI's investment in C.A. Tabacalera Nacional, a wholly owned foreign corporation incorporated in Venezuela. For further details on PMI's ceased operations in Venezuela and the impairment loss related to the sale of Vectura Group, see Note 20. \nRestructuring Activities \nand Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n, respectively. \nThe 2023 effective tax rate increased \n3.1\n percentage points to \n22.4\n%. The change in the effective tax rate for 2023, as compared to 2022, was unfavorably impacted by: (i) an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to the unremitted earnings of PMI's Russian subsidiaries due to the unilateral suspension of certain Russian double tax treaties by the Russian authorities on August 8, 2023, with respect to certain payments including dividends; (ii) the non-deductible Wellness and Healthcare goodwill impairment charge and (iii) an increase in foreign tax credit limitation related to GILTI, partially offset by changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction.\n109\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following: \nAt December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nDeferred income tax assets:\nAccrued postretirement and postemployment benefits\n$\n208\n \n$\n223\n \nAccrued pension costs\n384\n \n450\n \nInventory\n40\n \n27\n \nAccrued liabilities\n213\n \n191\n \nNet operating loss, tax credit, and other carryforwards \n912\n \n501\n \nInvestments in equity interests\n507\n \n80\n \nForeign exchange\n—\n \n149\n \nOther\n62\n \n19\n \nTotal deferred income tax assets\n2,326\n \n1,640\n \nLess: valuation allowance\n(\n1,130\n)\n(\n369\n)\nDeferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n1,196\n \n1,271\n \nDeferred income tax liabilities:\nIntangible assets\n(\n1,862\n)\n(\n2,136\n)\nProperty, plant and equipment\n(\n152\n)\n(\n218\n)\nUnremitted earnings\n(\n495\n)\n(\n438\n)\nForeign exchange\n(\n264\n)\n—\n \nOther\n—\n \n—\n \nTotal deferred income tax liabilities\n(\n2,773\n)\n(\n2,792\n)\nNet deferred income tax assets (liabilities)\n$\n(\n1,577\n)\n$\n(\n1,521\n)\nAt December 31, 2024, PMI recorded deferred tax assets for net operating loss, tax credit, and other carryforwards of $\n912\n million, with varying dates of expiration, primarily after 2029, including $\n381\n million with an unlimited carryforward period. At December 31, 2024, PMI has recorded a valuation allowance of $\n1,130\n million against deferred tax assets that do not meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold.  \nAt December 31, 2023, PMI recorded deferred tax assets for net operating loss, tax credit, and other carryforwards of $\n501\n million, with varying dates of expiration, primarily after 2028, including $\n274\n million with an unlimited carryforward period. At December 31, 2023, PMI has recorded a valuation allowance of $\n369\n million against deferred tax assets that do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.\n \nNote 13.\nSegment Reporting:  \nPMI’s subsidiaries and affiliates are primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, e-vapor and oral nicotine products.  Excluding the Wellness and Healthcare segment, PMI's segments are generally organized by geographic region and managed by segment managers who are responsible for the operating and financial results of the regions inclusive of combustible tobacco and smoke-free product categories sold in the region. As discussed in Note 1. \nBackground and Basis of Presentation\n, in January 2024, PMI updated its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the \nfour\n existing geographical segments. The \nfour\n geographical segments are as follows: Europe Region; South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS & MEA\"); East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU & PMI DF\"); and Americas Region. The Wellness and Healthcare segment remains unchanged.  \nPMI’s Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") evaluates geographical segment performance based on the regional operating income, which includes results from all product categories sold in each region, excluding Wellness and Healthcare products. Business operations in the Wellness and Healthcare segment are evaluated separately. The CODM reviews short-term and long-term trends, forecasts, and budget-to-actual variances to assess geographical segment performance and to allocate resources. Interest expense, net, and provision for income taxes are centrally managed and, accordingly, such items are not presented \n110\nby segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by management. Information about total assets by segment is not disclosed because such information is not reported to or used by PMI’s CODM. Segment goodwill and other intangible assets, net, are disclosed in Note 5. \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\n.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.  \n \nPMI disaggregates its net revenues from contracts with customers by product category for each of PMI's \nfour\n geographical segments, except the Wellness and Healthcare business. PMI believes this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. \nOn November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 improves reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that impact segment profit or loss,  regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. For further details, see Note 23. \nNew Accounting Standards\n.   \nNet revenues, significant expenses, and operating income (loss) by segment were as follows:\n \n(in millions) \nEurope\nSSEA, CIS & MEA\nEA, AU & PMI DF\nAmericas\nWellness & Healthcare\nTotal\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nNet revenues\n$\n15,357\n \n$\n11,261\n \n$\n6,393\n \n$\n4,534\n \n$\n333\n \n$\n37,878\n \nLess:\nCost of sales\n4,206\n \n5,313\n \n2,011\n \n1,531\n \n268\n \n13,329\n \nMarketing, administration and research costs\n4,213\n \n2,519\n \n1,504\n \n2,455\n \n456\n \n11,147\n \nOperating income (loss)\n$\n6,938\n \n$\n3,429\n \n$\n2,878\n \n$\n548\n \n$\n(\n391\n)\n$\n13,402\n \nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nNet revenues\n$\n14,231\n \n$\n10,629\n \n$\n6,201\n \n$\n3,807\n \n$\n306\n \n$\n35,174\n \nLess:\nCost of sales\n4,045\n \n5,109\n \n1,978\n \n1,485\n \n276\n \n12,893\n \nMarketing, administration and research costs\n4,017\n \n2,384\n \n1,684\n \n1,740\n \n235\n \n10,060\n \nImpairment of goodwill\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n665\n \n665\n \nOperating income (loss)\n$\n6,169\n \n$\n3,136\n \n$\n2,539\n \n$\n582\n \n$\n(\n870\n)\n$\n11,556\n \nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nNet revenues\n$\n12,972\n \n$\n10,467\n \n$\n5,936\n \n$\n2,116\n \n$\n271\n \n$\n31,762\n \nLess:\nCost of sales\n3,656\n \n4,343\n \n2,026\n \n1,036\n \n341\n \n11,402\n \nMarketing, administration and research costs\n3,540\n \n2,260\n \n1,486\n \n640\n \n188\n \n8,114\n \nOperating income (loss)\n$\n5,776\n \n$\n3,864\n \n$\n2,424\n \n$\n440\n \n$\n(\n258\n)\n$\n12,246\n \nTotal net revenues attributable to customers located in Japan, PMI's largest market in terms of net revenues, were $\n4.1\n billion, $\n3.9\n billion and $\n3.9\n billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of PMI's cigarettes and other tobacco products that are combusted. Other tobacco products primarily include roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos and do not include smoke-free products.\nNet revenues related to smoke-free, excluding wellness and healthcare, refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes, if applicable. These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of PMI's products that are not combustible tobacco products, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral products, as well as consumer accessories.\nNet revenues related to wellness and healthcare consist of operating revenues generated from the sale of products primarily associated with inhaled therapeutics, and oral and intra-oral delivery systems that are included in the operating results of PMI's Wellness and Healthcare business.\nItems affecting the comparability of results from operations were as follows:   \n•\nEgypt sales tax charge\n \n– \nIn the third quarter of 2024, following a ruling issued by the Higher Administrative Court in Egypt and subsequent evaluation of available remedies, PMI concluded that an adverse outcome was probable and recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n45\n million in relation to tax assessments for general sales tax deducted on imported cutfiller for the years 2014 to 2016. This pre-tax charge was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, and was included in the SSEA, CIS & MEA segment results.\n•\nLoss on sale of Vectura Group\n \n–\n In September 2024, PMI announced the execution of a definitive agreement to sell Vectura to Molex Asia Holdings Ltd. On December 31, 2024, we completed the sale. The sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of $\n199\n million. This pre-tax loss was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, and was included in the Wellness and Healthcare segment results. For further details, see Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n. \n•\nRestructuring charges\n - See Note 20. \nRestructuring Activities\n for details of the $\n180\n million and $\n109\n million pre-tax charges for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as well as a breakdown of these costs by segment. \n112\n•\nTermination of distribution arrangement in the Middle East \n–\n \nIn the first quarter of\n \n2023, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n80\n million following the termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East. This pre-tax charge was recorded as a reduction of net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings, and was included in the SSEA, CIS & MEA segment results for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n \n•\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangibles \n–\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, PMI recorded $\n680\n million of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets impairment charges that was included in the Wellness and Healthcare segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, PMI recorded an \nimpairment charge related to definite-lived intangible assets\n of $\n112\n million. This charge was included in the Wellness and Healthcare segment. For further details, see Note 5. \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\n.\n•\nSouth Korea indirect tax charge \n– \nOn July 13, 2023, PMI's South Korean subsidiary, PM Korea, received an adverse ruling from the Supreme Court of South Korea related to cases alleging underpayment of excise taxes in connection with a 2015 excise tax increase and subsequent audit by the South Korean Board of Audit and Inspection. The Supreme Court ruling reversed previous decisions that were in PM Korea’s favor at the trial and appellate levels. As a result of the ruling, we concluded that an adverse outcome was probable. Consequently, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $\n204\n million in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earning, reflecting the full amount previously paid by PM Korea, which was included in the EA, AU & PMI DF segment for the year ended December 31, 2023.  \n•\nTermination of agreement with Foundation for a Smoke-Free World \n– \nOn September 29, 2023, PMI and the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World (the \"Foundation\") entered into the Final Grant Agreement and Termination of the Second Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement (\"Agreement\"). Under the terms of the agreement, PMI paid $\n140\n million in the third quarter of 2023 in return for the termination of the pledge agreement between the parties.  As a result, in the third quarter of 2023, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n140\n million commensurate with the early termination of the pledge agreement. The pre-tax charge was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023 and was included in the operating results of the following segments: Europe ($\n60\n million); SSEA, CIS & MEA ($\n41\n million);  EA, AU & PMI DF ($\n24\n million); and Americas ($\n15\n million).  \n•\nCharges related to the war in Ukraine\n \n–\n  See Note 4. \nWar in Ukraine\n for details of the $\n53\n million and $\n151\n million pre-tax charges in the Europe segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n•\nSwedish Match AB acquisition accounting related items\n \n–\n See Note 3.\n Acquisitions and Divestitures\n for details of the $\n18\n million and $\n125\n million pre-tax purchase accounting adjustments related to the sale of acquired inventories stepped up to fair value.

Accordingly, the target allocation of PMI’s plan assets is broadly characterized as approximately \n55\n% in equity securities and approximately \n45\n% in debt securities and other assets. The strategy primarily utilizes indexed U.S. equity securities, international equity securities and investment-grade debt securities.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.\nPMI makes, and plans to make, contributions, to the extent that they are tax deductible and meet specific funding requirements of its funded pension plans. Currently, PMI anticipates making contributions of approximately $\n161\n million in 2025 to its pension plans, based on current tax and benefit laws. However, this estimate is subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return on pension assets, or changes in interest and currency rates.  \nThe estimated future benefit payments from PMI pension plans at December 31, 2024, are as follows: \n(in millions)\n2025\n$\n444\n \n2026\n452\n \n2027\n459\n \n2028\n466\n \n2029\n479\n \n2030 - 2034\n2,630\n \nPMI's expected future annual benefit payments for its postretirement health care plans are estimated to be not material through 2034.\nPostemployment Benefit Plans\nPMI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor postemployment benefit plans covering certain designated salaried and hourly employees. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees. Net postemployment costs were $\n238\n million, $\n213\n million and $\n184\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe amounts recognized in accrued postemployment costs net of plan assets on PMI's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, were $\n929\n million and $\n915\n million, respectively. \nThe accrued postemployment costs were determined using a weighted-average discount rate of \n4.9\n% and \n4.3\n% in 2024 and 2023, respectively; an assumed ultimate annual weighted-average turnover rate of \n2.9\n% and \n2.8\n% in 2024 and 2023, respectively; assumed compensation cost increases of \n2.3\n% in 2024 and \n2.4\n% in 2023, and assumed benefits as defined in the respective plans. In accordance with local regulations, certain postemployment plans are funded. As a result, the accrued postemployment costs disclosed above are presented net of the related assets of $\n30\n million and $\n33\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Postemployment costs arising from actions that offer employees benefits in excess of those specified in the respective plans are charged to expense when incurred.\nComprehensive Earnings (Losses)\nThe

exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. As a result, PMI uses deliverable and non-deliverable forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options, (collectively referred to as \"foreign exchange contracts\"), and interest rate contracts to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates related to net investments in foreign operations, third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. The primary currencies to which PMI is exposed include the Euro, Egyptian pound, Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, Polish zloty, Russian ruble and Swiss franc.  \nAdditionally, certain materials that PMI uses in the manufacturing of its products are exposed to market price risks. PMI uses commodity derivative contracts (“commodity contracts\") to manage its exposure to the market price volatility of certain commodity components of these materials.  \nThese foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity contracts are collectively referred to as \"derivative contracts\". PMI is not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Substantially all of PMI's derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements, whereby the right to offset occurs in the event of default by a participating party. While these contracts contain the enforceable right to offset through close-out netting rights, PMI elects to present them on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheets. Collateral associated with these arrangements is in the form of cash and is unrestricted. Changes in collateral posted are included in cash flows from investing activities and changes in collateral received are included in cash flows from financing activities. Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period.  PMI formally documents the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur.  If it were deemed probable that the forecasted transaction would not occur, the gain or loss would be recognized in earnings. \n122\nThe gross notional amounts for outstanding derivatives as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nDerivative contracts designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n25,149\n \n$\n21,987\n \nInterest rate contracts\n3,000\n \n3,600\n \nCommodity contracts\n9\n \n20\n \nDerivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\n15,942\n \n17,658\n \nTotal\n$\n44,100\n \n$\n43,265\n \nThe fair value of PMI’s derivative contracts included in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:\nDerivative Assets\nDerivative Liabilities\nFair\n \nValue\nFair\n \nValue\n(in millions)\nBalance Sheet\n Classification\n2024\n2023\nBalance Sheet \nClassification\n2024\n2023\nDerivative contracts designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\nOther current assets\n$\n772\n \n$\n345\n \nOther accrued liabilities\n$\n7\n \n$\n249\n \nOther assets\n299\n \n153\n \nIncome taxes and other liabilities\n60\n \n449\n \nInterest rate contracts\nOther current assets\n—\n \n1\n \nOther accrued liabilities\n50\n \n78\n \nOther assets\n4\n \n—\n \nIncome taxes and other liabilities\n3\n \n18\n \nCommodity contracts\nOther current assets\n—\n \n—\n \nOther accrued liabilities\n—\n \n5\n \nOther assets\n—\n \n—\n \nIncome taxes and other liabilities\n—\n \n1\n \nDerivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\nOther current assets\n \n331\n \n85\n \nOther accrued liabilities\n69\n \n425\n \nOther assets\n12\n \n—\n \nIncome taxes and other liabilities\n58\n \n143\n \nTotal gross amount derivatives contracts presented in the consolidated balance sheets\n$\n1,418\n \n$\n584\n \n$\n247\n \n$\n1,368\n \nGross amounts not offset in the consolidated balance sheets\nFinancial instruments\n(\n218\n)\n(\n374\n)\n(\n218\n)\n(\n374\n)\nCash collateral received/pledged\n(\n863\n)\n(\n109\n)\n(\n18\n)\n(\n551\n)\nNet amount\n$\n337\n \n$\n101\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n443\n \nPMI assesses the fair value of its derivative contracts using standard valuation models that use, as their basis, readily observable market inputs.  The fair value of PMI’s foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency swaps and interest rate contracts is determined by using the prevailing foreign exchange spot rates and interest rate differentials, and the respective maturity dates of the instruments.  The fair value of PMI’s currency options is determined by using a Black-Scholes methodology based on foreign \n123\nexchange spot rates and interest rate differentials, currency volatilities and maturity dates. The fair value of PMI’s commodity contracts is determined by using the prevailing market spot and futures prices and the respective maturity dates of the instruments. PMI’s derivative contracts have been classified within Level 2 at December 31, 2024 and 2023.   \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, PMI's derivative contracts impacted the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive earnings as follows:  \n(pre-tax, in millions)\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nAmount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Earnings/(Losses) on Derivatives\nStatement of Earnings \nClassification of Gain/(Loss) \non Derivatives\nAmount of Gain/(Loss) Reclassified from Other Comprehensive Earnings/(Losses) into Earnings\nAmount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDerivative contracts designated as hedging instruments:\nCash flow hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n433\n \n$\n195\n \n$\n288\n \nNet revenues\n$\n186\n \n$\n194\n \n$\n233\n \nCost of sales\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nMarketing, administration and research costs\n20\n \n27\n \n30\n \nInterest expense, net\n2\n \n(\n15\n)\n(\n7\n)\nInterest rate contracts\n95\n \n37\n \n292\n \nInterest expense, net\n51\n \n46\n \n(\n2\n)\nCommodity contracts\n(\n1\n)\n(\n7\n)\n—\n \nCost of sales\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nFair value hedges:\nInterest rate contracts\nInterest expense, net \n(a)\n$\n(\n32\n)\n$\n(\n14\n)\n$\n(\n83\n)\nNet investment hedges\n (b):\nForeign exchange contracts\n867\n \n(\n788\n)\n300\n \nInterest expense, net \n(c)\n293\n \n268\n \n181\n \nMarketing, administration and research costs\n35\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDerivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\nInterest expense, net\n219\n \n301\n \n112\n \nMarketing, administration and research costs \n(d)\n523\n \n(\n575\n)\n(\n169\n)\nTotal\n$\n1,394\n \n$\n(\n563\n)\n$\n880\n \n$\n293\n \n$\n252\n \n$\n254\n \n$\n1,003\n \n$\n(\n20\n)\n$\n41\n \n(a)\n \nThe gains (losses) from these contracts are offset by the changes in the fair value of the hedged item\n(b)\n Amount of gains (losses) on hedges of net investments principally related to changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates between the Euro and U.S. dollar\n(c)\n Represent the gains for amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing \n(d) \nThe gains (losses) from these contracts attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the (losses) and gains generated by the underlying intercompany and third-party loans being hedged\n124\nCash Flow Hedges\nPMI has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the foreign currency exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks related to certain forecasted transactions.  Gains and losses associated with qualifying cash flow hedge contracts are deferred as components of accumulated other comprehensive losses until the underlying hedged transactions are reported in PMI’s consolidated statements of earnings. As of December 31, 2024, PMI has hedged forecasted transactions with derivative contracts expiring at various dates through May 2028. Premiums paid for, and settlements of, the derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges are included primarily in cash flows from operating activities on PMI’s consolidated statements of cash flows. \nFair Value Hedges\nPMI has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate U.S. dollar-denominated debt that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates.  For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in current earnings. The carrying amount of the debt hedged, which includes the cumulative adjustment for fair value gains/losses, as of December 31, 2024 was $\n2,941\n million, of which $\n346\n million was recorded in \ncurrent portion of long-term debt\n and $\n2,595\n million was recorded in \nlong-term debt\n in the consolidated balance sheets.  The cumulative amount of fair value gains/(losses) included in the carrying amount of the debt hedged was $\n42\n million as of December 31, 2024.\nHedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations  \nPMI designates derivative contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt and other financial instruments as net investment hedges, primarily of its Euro net assets.  The amount of pre-tax gain/(loss) related to the non-derivative financial instruments, that was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive losses within currency translation adjustments, was $\n99\n million\n, $\n48\n million and $\n521\n million, for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Settlements of the derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are included in cash flows from investing activities on PMI’s consolidated statements of cash flows. \nOther Derivatives  \nPMI has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks related to intercompany loans between certain subsidiaries, and third-party loans. While effective as economic hedges, no hedge accounting is applied for these contracts; therefore, the gains (losses) relating to these contracts are reported in PMI’s consolidated statements of earnings.  Settlements of other derivative contracts are included primarily in cash flows from investing activities on PMI's consolidated statements of cash flows. \nQualifying Hedging Activities Reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses\nDerivative gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity.  Transfers of these gains or losses to earnings are offset by the corresponding gains or losses on the underlying hedged item.  \nHedging activity affected accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of income taxes, as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nGain/(loss) as of January 1,\n$\n241\n \n$\n266\n \n$\n4\n \nDerivative (gains)/losses transferred to earnings\n(\n213\n)\n(\n220\n)\n(\n219\n)\nChange in fair value\n439\n \n195\n \n481\n \nGain/(loss) as of December 31,\n$\n467\n \n$\n241\n \n$\n266\n \nAt December 31, 2024, PMI expects $\n260\n million of derivative gains that are included in accumulated other comprehensive losses to be reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings within the next 12 months. These gains are expected to be substantially offset by the statement of earnings impact of the respective hedged transactions.\nContingent Features\nPMI’s derivative instruments do not contain contingent features.\n125\nCredit Exposure and Credit Risk\nPMI is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties.  While PMI does not anticipate non-performance, its risk is limited to the fair value of the financial instruments less any cash collateral received or pledged.  PMI actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits and by selecting and continuously monitoring a diverse group of major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. \nOther Investments\nCertain PMI investments, which are comprised of held-to-maturity U.S. dollar denominated bonds in Argentina, have been classified within Level 1 and had a fair value of $\n125\n million at December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the gross unrecognized holding losses on these investments were $\n7\n million.\n \nNote 17.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Losses:\nPMI's accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of taxes, consisted of the following:\n(Losses) Earnings\nAt December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCurrency translation adjustments\n$\n(\n9,320\n)\n$\n(\n9,467\n)\n$\n(\n8,003\n)\nPension and other benefits\n(\n2,461\n)\n(\n2,589\n)\n(\n1,822\n)\nDerivatives accounted for as hedges\n467\n \n241\n \n266\n \nTotal accumulated other comprehensive losses\n$\n(\n11,314\n)\n$\n(\n11,815\n)\n$\n(\n9,559\n)\nReclassifications from Other Comprehensive Earnings\nThe movements in accumulated other comprehensive losses and the related tax impact, for each of the components above, that are due to current period activity and reclassifications to the income statement are shown on the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. (\"Altria\") and PMI, PMI will indemnify Altria and Philip Morris USA Inc. (\"PM USA\"), a U.S. tobacco subsidiary of Altria, for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.\nIt is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco or nicotine-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.\nDamages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in the case of the \n\"Health Care Cost Recovery \n126\nLitigation\" \ndescribed below, could range into the billions of U.S. dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. While, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation, litigation is subject to uncertainty. Additionally, as reported further below, beginning in March 2024, litigation related to oral nicotine products was filed against us and our subsidiary before certain courts in the United States.\nWe and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, except as stated otherwise in this Note 18. \nContingencies, \nit is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur.  Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\nIt is possible that our consolidated financial statements, including our results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\nAfter assessing the information available to it, except as stated otherwise in this Note 18. \nContingencies\n, (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any.\nCCAA Proceedings and Stay of Combustible Tobacco Product-Related Cases Pending in Canada\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec’s decision in both the \nLétourneau\n and\n Blais\n cases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (“RBH”), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp. (\"JTIM\"), and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\"), sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”) on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019, respectively.  CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course.  The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers. RBH's financial results have been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019.  \nAs part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 3, 2025 or the date on which the CCAA court issues an order on the Sanction Motion (discussed below) of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions.  These proceedings are presented below under the caption “\nStayed Litigation — Canada\n.” Ernst & Young Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal’s decision in the \nLétourneau\n and the \nBlais\n cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be extended by the stay period. \nWhile RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both\n Létourneau\n and the \nBlais\n cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all combustible tobacco product-related litigation pending in Canada. On October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement (“Proposed Plan”) setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation against RBH, its affiliates, and its affiliates’ indemnitees. The court-appointed mediator and monitors also filed substantially similar proposed plans for ITL and JTIM.\nUnder the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, ITL and JTIM (together, the “Companies”) would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD \n32.5\n billion (approximately $\n22.3\n billion).  This amount would be funded by an upfront payment equal to the companies’ cash and cash equivalents on hand plus court deposits (subject to an aggregate withholding of CAD \n750\n million (approximately $\n514\n million) of working capital) and annual payments based on a percentage of the Companies’ aggregate net income after taxes (excluding that generated by alternative products such as heat-not-burn, nicotine pouches, and e-vapor) until the global settlement amount is paid in full.  As stated in the Proposed Plan, the issue of allocation of the CAD \n32.5\n billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM (\"Allocation Issue\") remains unresolved. RBH and its affiliates, including PMI and its indemnitees, would obtain a release of claims relating to the manufacture, marketing, sale, or use of or exposure \n127\nto, RBH’s combustible and traditional smokeless tobacco products based on conduct prior to the effective date of the Proposed Plan; related litigation would also be dismissed—including those actions described in the section below entitled “\nStayed Litigation – Canada\n.” Alternative product businesses (including heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and nicotine pouches) would be transferred to an RBH affiliate or otherwise maintained separately from RBH's combustible business.  The Proposed Plan also contains a number of operating covenants that would govern RBH’s business going forward until the settlement amount has been paid.\nOn January 15, 2025, RBH’s court-appointed monitor filed a motion seeking an order by the CCAA court approving and sanctioning the Proposed Plan and authorizing and directing the monitor, among others, to take all steps and actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Proposed Plan (“Sanction Motion” and the requested order, the “Proposed Sanction Order”). On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to the Sanction Motion (“RBH Objection”). The RBH Objection argues that the Proposed Plan cannot be approved because it fails to resolve the Allocation Issue. The RBH Objection also states that, without an appropriate, fair and reasonable resolution of the Allocation Issue, RBH cannot presently consent to implementation of the Proposed Plan. To address the Allocation Issue, the RBH Objection seeks to amend the Proposed Sanction Order to include provisions (the “Proposed Allocation Provisions”) requiring that ITL and JTIM make payments to RBH from their retained working capital and net income after taxes over a period of years. ITL, JTIM, and certain claimant groups have opposed the Proposed Allocation Provisions set forth in the RBH Objection.    \nA judicial hearing to consider approval of the Proposed Plan, including the Sanction Motion, the RBH Objection and the Proposed Allocation Provisions, was held from January 29 through January 31, 2025.\n \nFurther hearing dates may be scheduled.\n \nA decision from the CCAA court on whether and what form to sanction the Proposed Plan is expected in the first quarter. If ultimately approved by the CCAA court and, among other things, not subject to appeal, implementation of the Proposed Plan is expected in 2025.\nFor additional information concerning the fair value of PMI’s continuing investment in RBH and the impairment charge recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event, see Item 8, Note 6. \nRelated Parties – Equity Investments and Other\n. \nStayed Litigation — Canada\nSmoking and Health Litigation — Canada\nIn the first class action pending in Canada, \nConseil Québécois Sur Le Tabac Et La Santé and Jean-Yves Blais v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.,\n \nRothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada\n, filed in November 1998, RBH and other Canadian cigarette manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants (the \"\nBlais \nClass Action\"). The plaintiffs, an anti-smoking organization and an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who suffers allegedly from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015.  The trial court found RBH and \ntwo\n other Canadian manufacturers liable and found that the class members’ compensatory damages totaled approximately CAD \n15.5\n billion (approximately $\n10.6\n billion), including pre-judgment interest. The trial court awarded compensatory damages on a joint and several liability basis, allocating \n20\n% to our subsidiary (approximately CAD \n3.1\n billion (approximately $\n2.1\n billion) including pre-judgment interest). In addition, the trial court awarded CAD \n90,000\n (approximately $\n62,000\n) in punitive damages, allocating CAD \n30,000\n (approximately $\n21,000\n) to RBH. The trial court estimated the disease class at \n99,957\n members.  RBH appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered RBH to furnish security totaling CAD \n226\n million (approximately $\n155\n million) to cover both the \nLétourneau \nand\n Blais\n cases, which RBH has paid in installments through March 2017.  The Court of Appeal ordered Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. to furnish security totaling CAD \n758\n million (approximately $\n520\n million) in installments through June 2017. JTI Macdonald Corp. was not required to furnish security in accordance with plaintiffs’ motion.  The Court of Appeal ordered that the security is payable upon a final judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial court’s judgment or upon further order of the Court of Appeal. \nOn March 1, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court’s findings of liability and the compensatory and punitive damages award while reducing the total amount of compensatory damages to approximately CAD \n13.5\n billion (approximately $\n9.3\n billion), including interest due to the trial court’s error in the calculation of interest. The compensatory damages award is on a joint and several basis with an allocation of \n20\n% to RBH (approximately CAD \n2.7\n billion (approximately $\n1.9\n billion), including pre-judgment interest). The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s findings that defendants violated the Civil Code of Quebec, the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, and the Quebec Consumer Protection Act by failing to warn adequately of the dangers of smoking and by conspiring to prevent consumers from learning of the dangers of smoking. The Court of Appeal further held that the plaintiffs either need not prove, or had adequately proven, that these faults were a cause of the class members’ injuries.  In accordance with the judgment, defendants were required to deposit their respective portions of the damages awarded in both the \nLétourneau\n case described below and the \nBlais\n case, approximately CAD \n1.1\n billion (approximately $\n754\n million), into trust accounts within \n60\n days.  RBH’s share of the deposit was approximately CAD \n257\n million (approximately $\n194\n million).  PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n194\n million in its consolidated results, representing $\n142\n million net of tax, as tobacco litigation-related \n128\nexpense, in the first quarter of 2019.  The charge reflects PMI’s assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of RBH and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment. \nIn the second class action pending in Canada, \nCecilia Létourneau v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada,\n filed in September 1998, RBH and other Canadian cigarette manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants (the \"\nLétourneau\n Class Action\").  The plaintiff, an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed addicted to smoking. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015.  The trial court found RBH and \ntwo\n other Canadian manufacturers liable and awarded a total of CAD \n131\n million (approximately $\n90\n million) in punitive damages, allocating CAD \n46\n million (approximately $\n32\n million) to RBH. The trial court estimated the size of the addiction class at \n918,000\n members but declined to award compensatory damages to the addiction class because the evidence did not establish the claims with sufficient accuracy.  The trial court found that a claims process to allocate the awarded punitive damages to individual class members would be too expensive and difficult to administer.  On March 1, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court’s findings of liability and the total amount of punitive damages awarded allocating CAD \n57\n million (approximately $\n39\n million), including interest to RBH. See the \nBlais \ndescription above for further detail concerning the security order pertaining to both \nLétourneau\n and \nBlais\n cases and the impact of the decision on PMI’s financial statements.\nRBH and PMI believe the findings of liability and damages in both \nLétourneau \nand the \nBlais\n cases were incorrect and in contravention of applicable law on several grounds including, the following: (i) defendants had no obligation to warn class members who knew, or should have known, of the risks of smoking; (ii) defendants cannot be liable to class members who would have smoked regardless of what warnings were given; and (iii) defendants cannot be liable to all class members given the individual differences among class members. \nIn the third class action pending in Canada, \nKunta v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, et al., The Queen's Bench, Winnipeg, Canada\n, filed June 12, 2009, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants.

All resolved cases have been terminated in our favor and only a small number of cases remain pending. The pending cases include \nnine\n proposed class actions, \n17\n health care cost recovery cases, \none\n public civil action, and individual cases. The amounts at issue in the pending individual cases would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, including our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. Of the pending combustible tobacco product-related cases, \nfour\n were initially decided in favor of plaintiffs and remain on appeal, or are subject to an appeal. These \nfour\n cases include the \nBlais\n Class Action and the \nLétourneau \nClass Action, described above under the caption \"\nSmoking and Health Litigation — Canada,\n\" and \ntwo\n individual cases where final resolution in the amount of the verdict would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, including our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.\nPending claims related to combustible tobacco products generally fall within the following categories:\nSmoking and Health Proposed Class Actions:\n These cases primarily allege personal injury and are brought by individual plaintiffs on behalf of a class or purported class of individual plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, breach of express and implied warranties, violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes.

Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including unjust enrichment, negligence, negligent design, strict liability, breach of express and implied warranties, violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy, public nuisance, defective product, failure to warn, sale of cigarettes to minors, and claims under statutes governing competition and deceptive trade practices. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause, remoteness of injury, failure to state a claim, adequate remedy at law, “unclean hands” (namely, that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in, and benefited from, the sale of cigarettes), and statute of limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were \n17\n health care cost recovery cases pending against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees in Brazil (\n1\n), Canada (\n10\n), Korea (\n1\n) and Nigeria (\n5\n), compared with \n17\n such cases on December 31, 2023 and \n17\n such cases on December 31, 2022.\n131\nThe health care cost recovery actions pending in Canada are described above under the caption “\nHealth Care Cost Recovery Litigation — Canada.\n”\nIn the health care cost recovery case in Brazil, \nThe Attorney General of Brazil v.

Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that defendants concealed the health hazards of smoking, marketed to youth, added ingredients to make their products more harmful and addictive, and misled consumers into believing that \nLights\n cigarettes are safer than regular cigarettes.  The National Health Insurance Service seeks to recover damages allegedly incurred in treating \n3,484\n patients with small cell lung cancer, squamous cell lung cancer, and squamous cell laryngeal cancer from 2003 to 2012.  The trial court dismissed the case in its entirety on November 20, 2020. The Appellate court granted the Plaintiff a \nde novo\n appeal in 2021 and determined that the appellate proceedings will take place in stages: wrongful conduct/product defect allegations first, then causation and finally issues such as standing/direct action.  The plaintiff's appeal remains pending.\n132\nPublic Civil Actions:\n Claims have been filed either by an individual, or a public or private entity, seeking to protect collective or individual rights, such as the right to health, the right to information or the right to safety.

National Assembly of Venezuela and the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court\n, filed April 29, 2008, we were not named as a defendant, but the plaintiffs published a notice pursuant to court order, notifying all interested parties to appear in the case. In January 2009, our subsidiary appeared in the case in response to this notice. The plaintiffs purport to represent the right to health of the citizens of Venezuela and claim that the government failed to protect adequately its citizens' right to health. The claim asks the court to order the government to enact stricter regulations on the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. In addition, the plaintiffs ask the court to order companies involved in the tobacco industry to allocate a percentage of their “sales or benefits” to establish a fund to pay for the health care costs of treating smoking-related diseases. In October 2008, the court ruled that plaintiffs have standing to file the claim and that the claim meets the threshold admissibility requirements. In December 2012, the court admitted our subsidiary and a subsidiary of British American Tobacco plc as interested third parties. In February 2013, our subsidiary answered the complaint.  On February 27, 2024, the Attorney General of Venezuela filed, on behalf of defendants, a motion to dismiss the case for lack of prosecution.\nSmoke-Free Products-Related Litigation\n \nClaims have been filed against PMI and one or more subsidiaries related to \nZYN\n nicotine pouches. These cases were filed either on behalf of an individual plaintiff, or on behalf of a purported class of individuals. Plaintiffs assert a variety of common law and statutory claims, and seek various forms of relief, including monetary and equitable relief.\nIn the first case, a putative class action, \nKelly v. Philip Morris International Inc., et al.\n, filed on March 19, 2024, before United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, plaintiff alleges, among other things, addiction to nicotine resulting from the use of \nZYN\n nicotine pouches (the \"\nKelly\n class action\"). The complaint named PMI and Swedish Match North America LLC as defendants.  Plaintiff purports to represent classes comprised of (i) all persons who purchased \nZYN\n products in the United States, (ii) all residents of Florida who purchased \nZYN\n products, and (iii) all residents of Florida who, at the time of their use of \nZYN\n products, were under the age of 21, and who procured and used \nZYN\n products. Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that defendants defectively designed \nZYN\n products and sold them in an unreasonably unsafe and dangerous condition, marketed \nZYN\n products to minors, and misrepresented or failed to warn consumers about information related to \nZYN\n products, including information about health risks associated with these products. Plaintiff asserts strict liability design defect and failure to warn claims, as well as negligence and fraud claims and is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, attorney’s fees and costs, interest, and medical monitoring. On May 6, 2024, PMI and Swedish Match North America LLC filed motions to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. On August 20, 2024, the court granted Swedish Match North America LLC’s motion to dismiss the fraud claim and plaintiff’s request for medical monitoring, but denied the motion to dismiss other claims, denied PMI’s motion to dismiss without prejudice, and granted plaintiff’s request to conduct jurisdictional discovery. On December 4, 2024, plaintiff filed an amended complaint against PMI and Swedish Match North America LLC and added \nthree\n additional entities as named defendants: Swedish Match USA Inc., PMI Global Services Inc., and Philip Morris Global Brands Inc. On December 18, 2024, PMI, Swedish Match USA Inc., PMI Global Services Inc., and Philip Morris Global Brands Inc., filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint with prejudice, and Swedish Match North America LLC filed a motion to dismiss the fraud claim. At this time, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for this proceeding and we cannot determine the likelihood of loss, or reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, from this proceeding.  \nIn the second case, a putative class action, \nBates-Ferreira v.

Philip Morris International Inc., et al.\n, filed April 3, 2024, before United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, plaintiff alleges, among other things, addiction to nicotine resulting from the use of \nZYN\n nicotine pouches. The complaint named PMI and Swedish Match North America LLC as defendants.

The subpoena requested, among other things, information concerning Swedish Match North America LLC’s compliance with D.C.’s licensing regulations, age-verification requirements, and prohibition on the sale of flavored tobacco products, including with respect to \nZYN\n nicotine pouches.  Swedish Match North America LLC cooperated with the investigation, and on December 12, 2024, it executed an assurance of voluntary compliance with the office of the Attorney General to resolve the Attorney General's investigation, without admitting liability or \n134\nwrongdoing. Pursuant to the assurance of voluntary compliance, Swedish Match North America LLC paid $\n1,200,000\n to D.C. and agreed to undertake certain limited conduct obligations moving forward.\nOther Litigation\nOn November 18, 2024, a putative class action, \nNeumark v. Swedish Match North America LLC\n, was filed before United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.  The complaint named Swedish Match North America LLC as the defendant.  Plaintiff alleges that Swedish Match North America LLC violated federal and state antitrust laws by, among other things, driving a competitor from the market through purportedly baseless litigation and entering into an allegedly anticompetitive agreement with PMI whereby PMI, through an indirect subsidiary, acquired Swedish Match North America LLC and eliminated itself as a competitor in the U.S. nicotine pouch market.  Plaintiff asserts claims under the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, state antitrust law, and for unjust enrichment.  Plaintiff seeks to represent (i) all natural persons, businesses, entities, and corporations in the United States who purchased \nZYN\n at retail during the class period; and (ii) all natural persons, businesses, entities, and corporations in the United States who live in states that have certain antitrust statutes who purchase \nZYN\n at retail during the class period.  Plaintiff is seeking damages (including treble damages as available under antitrust laws), costs, attorneys’ fees, disgorgement of profit, pre- and post-judgment interest, and declaratory and injunctive relief (including a declaration that the acquisition of Swedish Match North America LLC by PMI is unlawful and must result in divestiture or be enjoined).  On January 15, 2025, Swedish Match North America LLC filed a motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. Subsequently thereto, Plaintiff informed Swedish Match North America LLC that he will file an amended complaint, which is due on February 10, 2025 At this time, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for this proceeding and we cannot determine the likelihood of loss, or reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, from this proceeding.\nThe Department of Special Investigations of the government of Thailand (\"DSI\") conducted an investigation into alleged underpayment by Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\") of customs duties and excise taxes relating to imports from Indonesia covering the period 2000-2003. On January 26, 2017, the Public Prosecutor filed charges against PM Thailand and its former Thai employee in the Bangkok Criminal Court alleging that PM Thailand and its former employee jointly and with the intention to defraud the Thai government under-declared import prices of cigarettes to avoid full payment of taxes and duties in connection with import entries during the period from January 2002 to July 2003. The government sought a fine of approximately THB \n19.8\n billion (approximately $\n584\n million). In May 2017, Thailand enacted a new customs act. The new act, which took effect in November 2017, substantially limits the amount of fines that Thailand could seek in these proceedings.  PM Thailand believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the Customs Valuation Agreement of the World Trade Organization and Thai law, and that the allegations of the Public Prosecutor are inconsistent with several decisions already taken by Thai Customs and a Thai court. Trial in the case began in November 2018 and concluded in December 2019.  In March 2020, the trial court found our subsidiary guilty of under-declaration of the prices and imposed a fine of approximately THB \n130\n million (approximately $\n3.9\n million).  The trial court dismissed all charges against the individual defendant. In April 2020, as required by Thai law, our subsidiary paid the fine. This payment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment. Our subsidiary filed an appeal of the trial court's decision.  In addition, the Public Prosecutor filed an appeal of the trial court's decision challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendant and the amount of the fine imposed. The appellate court issued its decision on the appeals on January 31, 2023.  The appellate court affirmed the findings of under-declaration of import prices of cigarettes but reduced the fine imposed by the trial court. The appellate court directed the Public Prosecutor to coordinate with customs officials to calculate such reduced fine in accordance with the appellate court’s decision.  The appellate court affirmed the acquittal of the individual defendant. Our subsidiary has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Thailand. The Public Prosecutor has filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of Thailand challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendant and the amount of the fine. Thailand is required to refund any payment made by our subsidiary in excess of any fine assessed by the courts.\nIn July 2020, the Public Prosecutor’s office of Rome, Italy, notified our Italian subsidiary, Philip Morris Italia S.r.l. (“PM Italia”), as well as \nthree\n former or current employees and a former external consultant of PM Italia in July and March 2020, respectively, that it concluded a preliminary investigation against them for alleged contravention of anti-corruption laws and related disruption of trade freedom. The Public Prosecutor alleges that the individuals involved promised certain personal favors to government officials from January to July of 2018 in exchange for favorable treatment for PM Italia, and that PM Italia lacked appropriate organizational controls to prevent the alleged actions by the individuals. On September 21, 2020, the Public Prosecutor issued his indictment and referred the matter to the court. At the preliminary hearing held on May 11, 2021, the judge decided to refer all charges/defendants (including our affiliate) to trial. The first trial hearing took place on September 22, 2021. BAT has filed a civil claim against PM Italia claiming vicarious liability for the alleged wrongdoings of its former or current employees and seeking EUR\n50\n million (approximately $\n51\n million) in damages. After various postponements, the trial started on September 25, 2023, and is expected to continue in 2025 through a series of evidentiary hearings. PM Italia believes it has strong defenses to the charges against it and will defend them vigorously.\n135\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation filed a petition before the Arbitrazh Court of the Moscow Region seeking the suspension of corporate rights that Megapolis Distribution B.V. (“MDBV”), a legal entity incorporated in the Netherlands, held, pursuant to Dutch law, in JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), which is the distributor of PMI’s products in Russia.  On July 18, 2024, the court admitted the petition. On August 8, 2024, the Arbitrazh Court of the Moscow Region granted the forced localization, as requested by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. As a result, MDBV's interest and corporate rights in JSC TK Megapolis were transferred to JSC TK Megapolis. On December 5, 2024, JSC TK Megapolis registered the subsequent transfer of such interest and corporate rights to a PMI affiliate, ZAO Philip Morris Izhora. For additional information, see Note 6. \nRelated Parties – Equity Investments and Other.\nFollowing an October 2020 final decision by the highest court in Brazil in tax litigation pertaining to overpayments of certain indirect taxes, our affiliate modified the methodology for calculation of the deduction applicable to the indirect taxes at issue.  The Brazilian Tax Authority objected to such methodology and, on December 3, 2024, served our affiliate with notice of an assessment alleging underpayments of these indirect taxes during the 2020 fiscal year, for approximately BRL \n137\n million ($\n24\n million). Our affiliate believes it is probable that the Brazilian Tax Authority will issue assessments alleging underpayment of indirect taxes for subsequent fiscal years.  We disagree with the position of the Brazilian Tax Authority, and will defend vigorously. \nOn December 21, 2023, we were informed that Future Technology K.K. (“FTKK”) filed an application with Tokyo Customs against Sojitz Corporation (“Sojitz”), Philip Morris Japan Limited’s (“PMJL”) importer and distributor, due to alleged infringement of JP7299432.  FTKK sought an order stopping the importation of \nTEREA\n consumables.  FTKK did not in its application seek any monetary damages or costs.  PMJL entered an appearance in the proceeding as an interested party and filed its response to FTKK's application on January 31, 2024. The Customs hearing was held on May 28, 2024. On June 27, 2024 expert advisors to Customs provided their opinion that the patent at issue was not infringed. On June 28, 2024, FTKK withdrew its Customs application. The proceeding is now concluded. On January 26, 2024, PMJL filed a declaratory judgment action in Tokyo District Court seeking a declaration that JP7299432 is invalid and/or not infringed. The declaratory judgment action has now concluded following FTKK's waiver of its right to seek relief from PMJL for infringement of JP7299432, which effectively resolved PMJL's request for a declaration of no liability for infringement of that patent.\nIn July and August 2024, respectively, FTKK filed \ntwo\n patent infringement actions against Sojitz, PMJL’s importer and distributor, for alleged infringement of \ntwo\n patents by \nTEREA\n consumables.  FTKK asserts a claim for damages. PMJL is obligated to indemnify Sojitz for damages and intervened in the matters. Merits briefing in the matters commenced in December 2024. In November and December 2024, FTKK filed \nseven\n additional patent infringement actions against Sojitz for alleged infringement of \nseven\n new FTKK patents by \nTEREA\n and \nSENTIA\n consumables.  FTKK asserts a claim for damages in these actions. PMJL is obligated to indemnify Sojitz for damages and intervened in the matters. Merits briefing in these matters is expected to commence in the first half of 2025.  On November 27, 2024, we were informed that FTKK filed a new application with Tokyo Customs against Sojitz, PMJL’s importer and distributor, on the basis of alleged infringement of another FTKK patent.  FTKK is seeking an order stopping the importation of \nTEREA\n and \nSENTIA\n consumables. At this time, FTKK is not seeking any monetary damages or costs. PMJL has entered an appearance in the proceeding as an interested party and filed its opposition to FTKK’s application on January 9, 2025.  On January 9, 2025, PMJL and Sojitz filed a declaratory judgment action against FTKK in Tokyo District Court with respect to the patent at issue in the pending Tokyo Customs matter on the basis that the relevant patent is not infringed or is invalid.  PMJL intends to vigorously defend the matters commenced by FTKK and take steps to mitigate disruption, if any, that could result from FTKK’s claims.\nOther patent challenges are pending in various jurisdictions.\nWe are also involved in additional litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business. While the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate outcomes of other litigation, including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nNote 19.\nSale of Accounts Receivable: \nTo mitigate risk and enhance cash and liquidity management PMI sells trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions. These arrangements allow PMI to sell, on an ongoing basis, certain trade receivables without recourse. The trade receivables sold are generally short-term in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets. PMI sells trade receivables under \ntwo\n types of arrangements, servicing and non-servicing.  For servicing arrangements, PMI continues to service the sold trade receivables on an administrative basis and does not act on behalf of the unaffiliated financial institutions. When applicable, a servicing liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the servicing. The amounts associated with the servicing liability were not material for the \n136\nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.  Under the non-servicing arrangements, PMI does not provide any administrative support or servicing after the trade receivables have been sold to the unaffiliated financial institutions.  \nCumulative trade receivables sold, including excise taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, were $\n11.9\n billion and $\n13.3\n billion, respectively.  PMI’s operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets, which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions.  The trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were $\n0.9\n billion, $\n1.6\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion, respectively. The net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The difference between the carrying amount of the trade receivables sold and the sum of the cash received is recorded as a loss on sale of trade receivables within marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the loss on sale of trade receivables was $\n42\n million, $\n49\n million and $\n26\n million, respectively.\n \nNote 20.\nRestructuring Activities:  \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, PMI recorded total pre-tax restructuring charges of $\n180\n million and $\n109\n million, respectively. These pre-tax charges were included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2022, PMI did \nno\nt record any charges related to restructuring activities. \nIQOS\n products sourcing for the U.S. market \n \nOn February 1, 2024, a subsidiary of PMI entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Nicoventures Trading Limited (“NTV”), an affiliate of British American Tobacco p.l.c. (“BAT”). In accordance with its terms, the parties to the Settlement Agreement filed a joint motion to rescind the limited exclusion order and the cease-and-desist order issued by the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) on September 29, 2021, which was granted on March 11, 2024. Prior to their rescission, the orders prohibited the importation and sales of imported \nIQOS\n products to the United States of America (for further details of the Settlement Agreement, ITC order and its rescission, see Note 18. \nContingencies\n). As a result, PMI has initiated a project in the first quarter of 2024 to restructure the sourcing of \nIQOS\n products to commercialize them in the United States.  For further details on \nIQOS\n commercialization in the U.S. and the related agreement with Altria Group, Inc (“Altria”), see Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n.\nIn 2024, PMI recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $\n133\n million related to this restructuring activity. This amount included contract termination costs with suppliers of $\n73\n million, including prepaid commitments of $\n20\n million. The amount also included asset impairment costs of $\n60\n million, primarily related to machinery and equipment and other assets, which were non-cash charges.\nVenezuela   \nIn the first quarter of 2024, PMI ceased its operations in Venezuela and as a result, recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $\n47\n million. The amount primarily included non-cash charges related to the reclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation losses from other comprehensive losses of $\n38\n million and asset impairment charge of $\n5\n million related to land and buildings. This amount also included contract termination, severance and other related costs of $\n4\n million, which were paid in cash.  \nFor details on the income tax impact of the transaction, see Note 12. \nIncome Taxes\n.  \nManufacturing Footprint Optimization - Germany \nAs a result of declining demand for cigarettes and other tobacco products in Europe, \ntwo\n of PMI’s German subsidiaries, Philip Morris Manufacturing GmbH and F6 Cigarettenfabrik GmbH & Co. KG, initiated consultations with employee representatives on October 29, 2024, on a proposal to end production in the factories located in Berlin and in Dresden by the end of the second quarter of 2025, and to seek to agree on fair solutions for any impacted employees. Until the consultation process is concluded, the closure is not considered probable, and the total potential costs associated with this contemplated proposal cannot be determined and, as a result, no related costs were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n137\nE-Vapor Products Manufacturing Optimization   \n \nIn the first quarter of 2023, PMI initiated a project to fully outsource and restructure the manufacturing of e-vapor devices and consumables. As a result, PMI recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $\n109\n million. This amount included contract termination costs for suppliers of $\n78\n million, including $\n21\n million of embedded finance lease terminations, payable in cash. This amount also included asset impairment costs of $\n31\n million, primarily related to machinery and equipment, which were non-cash charges.\nRestructuring charges by Segment\nDuring 2024 and 2023, PMI recorded the following pre-tax restructuring charges by segment: \n \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nReclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation losses from other comprehensive losses:  \nAmericas\n$\n38\n \n$\n—\nTotal reclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation losses from other comprehensive losses\n38\n \n—\nContract termination charges: \n(1)\nEurope\n—\n34\nSSEA, CIS & MEA\n—\n23\nEA, AU & PMI DF\n—\n14\nAmericas\n77\n \n7\nTotal contract termination charges\n77\n \n78\nAsset impairment charges \n(1)\nEurope\n—\n13\nSSEA, CIS & MEA\n—\n9\nEA, AU & PMI DF\n—\n5\nAmericas\n65\n \n4\nTotal asset impairment charges\n65\n \n31\nRestructuring charges\n$\n180\n \n109\n(1) \nE-vapor products manufacturing optimization charges in 2023\n \nwere allocated across all geographical segments.\nMovement in Restructuring Related Liabilities \nThe movement in restructuring related liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was as follows: \n(in millions)\n \nLiability balance, January 1, 2024\n$\n29\n \nCharges, net\n77\n \nCash spent\n(\n58\n)\nPrepaid commitments\n(\n20\n)\nCurrency/other\n—\n \nLiability balance, December 31, 2024\n$\n28\n \nFuture cash payments for restructuring activities incurred to date are anticipated to be substantially paid by the end of 2025.\n \n138\nNote 21.\nLeases:\nPMI has operating and finance leases that are principally for real estate (office space, warehouses and retail store space), machinery and equipment, and vehicles.

Under the SCF program, the suppliers may elect, at their sole discretion, to sell PMI's payment obligations to these financial institutions. The suppliers independently negotiate the sale arrangements directly with these financial institutions. PMI does not participate in these negotiations, nor does it have any economic interest in these agreements, or in the designated suppliers’ voluntary decision to sell PMI's payment obligations to these financial institutions. No guarantees or securities are provided by PMI or any of its subsidiaries under the SCF programs. PMI's obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted by the suppliers’ decision to sell amounts under the SCF program. The payment terms of PMI’s suppliers generally do not exceed \n120\n days. All outstanding payable amounts related to suppliers that are participating in the SCF program are recorded in \naccounts payable\n in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. The associated payments are included in cash flows from operating activities within PMI's consolidated statement of cash flows. \n140\nThe rollforward of PMI's outstanding obligations under its SCF program for the year ended December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n(in millions)\n2024\nAmount due to suppliers participating in the SCF program as of January 1, 2024\n$\n864\n \nInvoices added during the year\n3,405\n \nInvoices paid during the year\n(\n3,207\n)\nCurrency/Other\n(\n48\n)\nAmount due to suppliers participating in the SCF program as of December 31, 2024\n$\n1,014\n \n141\nNote 23.\nNew Accounting Standards:   \nRecently adopted \nOn November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 improves reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that impact segment profit or loss, regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. PMI adopted the additional disclosure requirements on the specified effective date within its annual reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024, and its interim reporting starting for the quarter ending March 31, 2025.  \nRecently issued\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”).  ASU 2023-09 enhances the transparency of income tax disclosures, primarily by requiring public business entities to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation tabular presentation, as well as by providing additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 also requires disaggregated disclosures of federal, state and foreign income tax taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The amendments are applicable on a prospective basis, although retrospective basis is also permitted.

ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. PMI is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2024-03 on its disclosures.\n \n142\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  \nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of \n      Philip Morris International Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ (deficit) equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n143\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters  \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nTobacco-Related Litigation for Smoking and Health Class Actions and Health Care Cost Recovery Cases\nAs desc\nribed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has nine smoking and health class actions and 17 health care cost recovery cases pending. The Company records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when management determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Except as stated otherwise in Note 18, w\nhile it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available, (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any.  \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to tobacco-related litigation for smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when assessing the probability of a loss being incurred and determining whether the amount or range of the potential loss for each case can be reasonably estimated and (ii) a  high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s assessment of smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases, including controls over determining whether the probability and range of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as controls over financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others (i) confirming with external and internal legal counsel the possibility or probability of an unfavorable outcome and the extent to which the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (iii) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases contingencies disclosures.\nImpairment Related to the Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Equity Investment  \nAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, since the 2019 deconsolidation of Rothmans, Benson and Hedges Inc. (RBH), the Company has accounted for its continuing investment in the business as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value.  On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the proposed plan of compromise and arrangement (Proposed Plan) with the CCAA court. Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate settlement, which was determined to be an indicator that the Company’s investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed Plan, management evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in RBH was lower than its carrying value. As a result, management performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million. The fair value of the continuing investment in RBH of $714 million represented the estimated fair value of the underlying business, net of management’s best estimate of the share of the aggregate global settlement amount that could be allocated to RBH, and was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis. In determining the fair value of the investment in RBH, management made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada. In addition, significant estimates were made with respect to the allocation amount of the aggregate global settlement amount, as well as the deductibility of the settlement amount payment for income tax purposes in Canada.\n144\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment of the equity investment in RBH is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Company’s investment in RBH; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada and the estimate of the allocation amount of the aggregate global settlement amount as well as the deductibility of the settlement amount payment for income tax purposes in Canada; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s equity investment impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s investment in RBH. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the investment in RBH; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow analysis; (iii) testing completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow analysis; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the valuation of the combustible cigarette business and the estimate of the allocation amount of the aggregate global settlement amount; and (v) evaluating the deductibility of the settlement amount payment for income tax purposes in Canada. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to sales volumes and operating margins related to the valuation of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada and the estimate of the allocation amount of the aggregate global settlement amount involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current economic conditions and recent operating results of RBH; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow analysis; (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption related to the valuation of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada; and (iii) the deductibility of the settlement amount payment for income tax purposes in Canada.\n/S/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS SA\nPricewaterhouseCoopers SA\n \nLausanne, Switzerland\nFebruary 6, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\n145\nReport of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n \nManagement of Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI” or \"we\") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. PMI’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that: \n \n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of PMI;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of PMI are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of PMI; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n \nInternal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nManagement assessed the effectiveness of PMI’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework \n(2013)\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of PMI’s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit & Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. \nBased on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2024, PMI maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. \nPricewaterhouseCoopers SA, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of PMI included in this report, has audited the effectiveness of PMI’s internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2024, as stated in their report herein. \nFebruary 6, 2025 \n146\nItem 9.\nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. \n \nNone.\nItem 9A.\nControls and Procedures.   \n \nPMI carried out an evaluation, with the participation of PMI’s management, including PMI’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of PMI’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, PMI’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that PMI’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There have been no changes in PMI’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, PMI’s internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm are included in Item 8.\n \nItem 9B.\nOther Information. \n \nOn February 4, 2025, Juan José Daboub informed PMI's board of directors (the “Board”) that he will not stand for re-election to the Board at our 2025 annual meeting of shareholders.
