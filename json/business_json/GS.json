Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the firm), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The firm’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the firm’s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the firm’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAs of December 31, 2024, management conducted an assessment of the firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 was effective.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the firm; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the firm’s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nThe firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PCAOB ID \n238\n), an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n127\nReport  of  Independent  Registered  Public \nAccounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \nBasis for Opinions \nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \n128\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nReport  of  Independent  Registered  Public \nAccounting Firm\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments \nAs described in Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2024, the Company carries financial instruments at fair value, which includes $20.4 billion of financial assets and $25.7 billion of financial liabilities classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (a portion of which relates to certain equity securities and hybrid financial instruments), as one or more inputs to the financial instrument’s valuation technique are significant and unobservable. Significant unobservable inputs used by management to value certain of the level 3 financial instruments included market multiples, discount rates, and capitalization rates for equity securities; and correlation and volatility for hybrid financial instruments.  \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of certain level 3 financial instruments, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the significant unobservable inputs related to market multiples, discount rates, and capitalization rates for equity securities; and correlation for hybrid financial instruments, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including controls over the methods and aforementioned significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain level 3 financial instruments. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management, as well as (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of certain level 3 financial instruments, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the techniques used by management, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs, and either (iv) the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of the techniques used by management and (b) the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs, or (v) the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s estimate by (a) evaluating the appropriateness of the techniques used by management and (b) developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of certain level 3 securities using independently determined assumptions, and comparing the independent range of prices to management’s estimate.\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n129\nReport  of  Independent  Registered  Public \nAccounting Firm\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Wholesale Loan Portfoli\no\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for credit losses was $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $2.1 billion relates to the wholesale loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is measured using a modeled approach. These models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life and macroeconomic indicators (the most significant to the forecast model being the forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates), the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. The allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s internal credit ratings, forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, including controls over the determination of management’s internal credit ratings, forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the allowance for credit losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (iii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of the forecast model and methodology used by management (b) the reasonableness of management’s internal credit ratings, forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates, and (c) the reasonableness of the qualitative component to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting. \n/s/  \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 26, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1922.\n130\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 2. \nBasis of Presentation\n \nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of Group Inc. and all other entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n \nAll references to 2024, 2023 and 2022 refer to the firm’s years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Any reference to a future year refers to a year ending on December 31 of that year. Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation.\n \nNote 3. \nSignificant Accounting Policies\n \nThe firm’s significant accounting policies include when and how to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities, measuring the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, and when to consolidate an entity. See Note 4 for policies on fair value measurements, Note 9 for policies on the allowance for credit losses, and below and Note 17 for policies on consolidation accounting.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nConsolidation \nThe firm consolidates entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest. The firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (VIE). \nVoting Interest Entities.\n Voting interest entities are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently and (ii) the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the firm has a controlling majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity is consolidated. \nVariable Interest Entities.\n A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when the firm has a variable interest or interests that provide it with (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for further information about VIEs. \nEquity-Method Investments.\n When the firm does not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but can exert significant influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies, the investment is generally accounted for at fair value by electing the fair value option available under U.S. GAAP. Significant influence generally exists when the firm owns 20% to 50% of the entity’s common stock or in-substance common stock. \nIn certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of accounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to the firm’s principal business activities, when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-benefit considerations are less significant. See Note 8 for further information about equity-method investments.\n \nInvestment Funds.\n The firm has formed investment funds with third-party investors. These funds are typically organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which the firm acts as general partner or manager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These funds are usually voting interest entities and generally are not consolidated because third-party investors typically have rights to terminate the funds or to remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in these funds are generally measured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for further information about investments in funds.\n \nUse of Estimates \nPreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, the most important of which relate to fair value measurements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information, but actual results could be materially different.\n \nRevenue Recognition \nFinancial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value.\n Trading assets and liabilities and certain investments are carried at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to account for certain of its loans and other financial assets and liabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. Fair value gains or losses are generally included in market making or other principal transactions. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n137\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRevenue from Contracts with Clients.\n The firm recognizes revenue earned from contracts with clients for services, such as investment banking, investment management, and execution and clearing (contracts with clients), when the performance obligations related to the underlying transaction are completed. \nRevenues from contracts with clients represent approximately \n45\n% of total non-interest revenues for both 2024 and 2023 (including approximately \n85\n% of investment banking revenues, approximately \n95\n% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees), and approximately \n50\n% of total non-interest revenues for 2022 (including approximately \n85\n% of investment banking revenues, approximately \n95\n% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees). See Note 25 for information about net revenues by business segment. \nInvestment Banking \nAdvisory.\n Fees from financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues when the services related to the underlying transaction are completed under the terms of the assignment. Non-refundable deposits and milestone payments in connection with financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction or when the assignment is otherwise concluded. \nExpenses associated with financial advisory assignments are recognized when incurred and are included in transaction based expenses. Client reimbursements for such expenses are included in investment banking revenues. \nUnderwriting. \nFees from underwriting assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction based on the terms of the assignment. \nExpenses associated with underwriting assignments are generally deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the assignment is otherwise concluded. Such expenses are included in transaction based expenses for completed assignments. \nInvestment Management\n \nThe firm earns management fees and incentive fees for investment management services, which are included in investment management revenues. The firm makes payments to brokers and advisors related to the placement of the firm’s investment funds (distribution fees), which are included in transaction based expenses. \nManagement Fees.\n Management fees for mutual funds are calculated as a percentage of daily NAV and are received monthly. Management fees for hedge funds are calculated as a percentage of month-end NAV and are generally received quarterly. Management fees for separately managed accounts are calculated as a percentage of either the daily or monthly NAV and are received quarterly. Management fees for private equity funds are calculated as a percentage of monthly invested capital or committed capital and are generally received quarterly, semi-annually or annually, depending on the fund. Management fees are recognized over time in the period the services are provided. \nDistribution fees paid by the firm are calculated based on either a percentage of the management fee, the investment fund’s NAV or the committed capital. Such fees are included in transaction based expenses. \nIncentive Fees.\n Incentive fees are calculated as a percentage of a fund’s or separately managed account’s return, or excess return above a specified benchmark or other performance target. Incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a twelve-month period or over the life of a fund. Fees that are based on performance over a twelve-month period are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the measurement period. For fees that are based on investment performance over the life of the fund, future investment underperformance may require fees previously distributed to the firm to be returned to the fund. \nIncentive fees earned from a fund or separately managed account are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. Therefore, incentive fees recognized during the period may relate to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. \n138\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCommissions and Fees\n \nThe firm earns substantially all commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on stock, options and futures markets, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade is executed. The firm also provides third-party research services to clients in connection with certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third-party research costs incurred by the firm in connection with such arrangements are presented net within commissions and fees. \nRemaining Performance Obligations \nRemaining performance obligations are services that the firm has committed to perform in the future in connection with its contracts with clients. The firm’s remaining performance obligations are generally related to its financial advisory assignments and certain investment management activities. Revenues associated with remaining performance obligations relating to financial advisory assignments cannot be determined until the outcome of the transaction. For the firm’s investment management activities, where fees are calculated based on the NAV of the fund or separately managed account, future revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. \nThe firm is able to determine the future revenues associated with management fees calculated based on committed capital. As of December 2024, substantially all future net revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations will be recognized through 2033. Annual revenues associated with such performance obligations average less than $\n300\n million through 2033.\n \nTransfers of Financial Assets \nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales, any gains or losses are recognized in net revenues. Assets or liabilities that arise from the firm’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. For transfers of financial assets that are not accounted for as sales, the assets are generally included in trading assets and the transfer is accounted for as a collateralized financing, with the related interest expense recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 11 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as collateralized financings and Note 16 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales.\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nThe firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight deposits held in the ordinary course of business. Cash and cash equivalents included cash and due from banks of $\n5.36\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n7.93\n billion as of December 2023. Cash and cash equivalents also included interest-bearing deposits with banks of $\n176.73\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n233.65\n billion as of December 2023. \nThe firm segregates cash for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. Cash and cash equivalents segregated for regulatory and other purposes were $\n14.84\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n17.08\n billion as of December 2023. In addition, the firm segregates securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. See Note 11 for further information about segregated securities.\n \nCustomer and Other Receivables \nCustomer and other receivables included receivables from customers and counterparties of $\n92.88\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n90.16\n billion as of December 2023, and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $\n40.84\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n42.33\n billion as of December 2023. Such receivables primarily consist of customer margin loans, collateral posted in connection with certain derivative transactions, and receivables resulting from unsettled transactions.\nSubstantially all of these receivables are accounted for at amortized cost net of any allowance for credit losses, which generally approximates fair value. As these receivables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these receivables been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2024 and December 2023. See Note 10 for further information about customer and other receivables accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Interest on customer and other receivables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income. \nCustomer and other receivables includes receivables from contracts with clients and contract assets. Contract assets represent the firm’s right to receive consideration for services provided in connection with its contracts with clients for which collection is conditional and not merely subject to the passage of time. The firm’s receivables from contracts with clients were $\n4.08\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n3.59\n billion as of December 2023. As of both December 2024 and December 2023, contract assets were not material.\n \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n139\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCustomer and Other Payables\n \nCustomer and other payables included payables to customers and counterparties of $\n217.15\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n220.71\n billion as of December 2023, and payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $\n6.11\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n10.02\n billion as of December 2023. Such payables primarily consist of customer credit balances related to the firm’s prime brokerage activities. Customer and other payables are accounted for at cost plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these payables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these payables been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2024 and December 2023. Interest on customer and other payables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest expense.\n \nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities \nTo reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, the firm may enter into master netting agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, netting agreements) with counterparties that permit it to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. A netting agreement is a contract with a counterparty that permits net settlement of multiple transactions with that counterparty, including upon the exercise of termination rights by a non-defaulting party. Upon exercise of such termination rights, all transactions governed by the netting agreement are terminated and a net settlement amount is calculated. In addition, the firm receives and posts cash and securities collateral with respect to its derivatives and securities financing transactions, subject to the terms of the related credit support agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, credit support agreements). An enforceable credit support agreement grants the non-defaulting party exercising termination rights the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of the firm’s right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the firm evaluates various factors, including applicable bankruptcy laws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.\nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) in the consolidated balance sheets when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities borrowed and loaned transactions with the same settlement date are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis in the consolidated balance sheets when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements. \nIn the consolidated balance sheets, derivatives are reported net of cash collateral received and posted under enforceable credit support agreements, when transacted under an enforceable netting agreement. In the consolidated balance sheets, resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed and loaned, are not reported net of the related cash and securities received or posted as collateral. See Note 11 for further information about collateral received and pledged, including rights to deliver or repledge collateral. See Notes 7 and 11 for further information about offsetting assets and liabilities.\n \nForeign Currency Translation \nAssets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the consolidated balance sheets and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on transactions in nonfunctional currencies are recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements of a non-U.S. operation, when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are included, net of hedges and taxes, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n \n140\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRecent Accounting Developments \nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (ASC 326)\n.\n In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, “Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326) — Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.” This ASU eliminates the recognition and measurement guidance for troubled debt restructurings and requires enhanced disclosures about loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. This ASU also requires enhanced disclosure for loans that have been charged off. This ASU became effective for the firm in January 2023 under a prospective approach. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated financial statements.\nFair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (ASC 820).\n \nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions.” This ASU clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered in measuring its fair value. In addition, the ASU requires specific disclosures related to equity securities that are subject to contractual sale restrictions. This ASU became effective for the firm in January 2024 under a prospective approach. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated financial statements. \nAccounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method (ASC 323).\n \nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, “Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323) — Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method.” This ASU expands the proportional amortization method election currently associated with low-income housing tax credits to other qualifying tax credits and requires incremental disclosures for programs in which the proportional amortization method is elected. This ASU became effective for the firm in January 2024 under a modified retrospective approach. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated financial statements.\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASC 280). \nIn N\november 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” This ASU requires enhanced disclosures primarily about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. This ASU became effective for the firm for annual periods beginning in January 2024, and is effective for interim periods beginning in January 2025 under a retrospective approach. Since this ASU only requires additional disclosures, adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the firm’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 25 for further information.\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASC 740).\n In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This ASU requires incremental disclosures primarily related to the reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate, as well as income taxes paid. This ASU is effective for the firm for annual periods beginning in January 2025 under a prospective approach with the option to apply it retrospectively. Since this ASU only requires additional disclosures, adoption of this ASU will not have an impact on the firm’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (ASC 220).\n In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” This ASU requires additional disaggregation of certain expenses within the footnotes to the financial statements. This ASU is effective for the firm for annual periods beginning in January 2027, and interim periods beginning in January 2028 under a prospective approach. Early adoption and retrospective application is permitted. Since this ASU only requires additional disclosures, adoption of this ASU will not have an impact on the firm’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n141\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 4. \nFair Value Measurements \nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). \nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined by reference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs, including, but not limited to, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a given financial instrument relative to a benchmark interest rate). \nU.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial instrument’s level in this hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, the firm considers, among other factors, a portfolio’s net risk exposure to that input. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: \nLevel 1.\n Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets to which the firm had access at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. \nLevel 2.\n Inputs to valuation techniques are observable, either directly or indirectly. \nLevel 3.\n One or more inputs to valuation techniques are significant and unobservable. \nThe fair values for substantially all of the firm’s financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and the firm’s credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence. \nThe table below presents financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value. \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nTotal level 1 financial assets\n$\n436,298\n \n$\n332,549\n \nTotal level 2 financial assets\n497,514\n \n519,130\n \nTotal level 3 financial assets\n20,358\n \n25,100\n \nInvestments in funds at NAV\n2,547\n \n3,000\n \nCounterparty and cash collateral netting\n(\n49,048\n)\n(\n51,134\n)\nTotal financial assets at fair value\n$\n907,669\n \n$\n828,645\n \nTotal assets\n$\n1,675,972\n \n$\n1,641,594\n \nTotal level 3 financial assets divided by:\nTotal assets\n1.2\n \n%\n1.5\n \n%\nTotal financial assets at fair value\n2.2\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\nTotal level 1 financial liabilities\n$\n100,350\n \n$\n125,715\n \nTotal level 2 financial liabilities\n611,340\n \n523,709\n \nTotal level 3 financial liabilities\n25,721\n \n28,704\n \nCounterparty and cash collateral netting\n(\n37,750\n)\n(\n44,135\n)\nTotal financial liabilities at fair value\n$\n699,661\n \n$\n633,993\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n1,553,976\n \n$\n1,524,689\n \nTotal level 3 financial liabilities divided by:\nTotal liabilities\n1.7\n \n%\n1.9\n%\nTotal financial liabilities at fair value\n3.7\n \n%\n4.5\n%\nIn the table above: \n•\nCounterparty netting among positions classified in the same level is included in that level.\n•\nCounterparty and cash collateral netting represents the impact on derivatives of netting across levels.\nThe table below presents a summary of level 3 financial assets. \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nTrading assets:\nTrading cash instruments\n$\n1,213\n \n$\n1,791\n \nDerivatives\n4,126\n \n5,161\n \nInvestments\n14,142\n \n17,138\n \nLoans\n683\n \n823\n \nOther assets\n194\n \n187\n \nTotal\n$\n20,358\n \n$\n25,100\n \nLevel 3 financial assets as of December 2024 decreased compared with December 2023, primarily reflecting a decrease in level 3 investments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe valuation techniques and nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the firm’s financial instruments are described below. See Note 5 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 financial instruments. \nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans \nLevel 1.\n Level 1 instruments include U.S. government obligations, most non-U.S. government obligations, certain agency obligations, certain corporate debt instruments, certain money market instruments and actively traded listed equities.\n \nThese instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average daily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity. \nLevel 2.\n Level 2 instruments include certain non-U.S. government obligations, most agency obligations, most mortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate debt instruments, most state and municipal obligations, most money market instruments, most other debt obligations, restricted or less liquid listed equities, certain private equities, commodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be verified to quoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources. \nValuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 instruments (i) if the instrument is subject to transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other premiums and liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence. \nLevel 3.\n Level 3 instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, level 3 instruments are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence, including values realized on sales. \nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques. The valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 instrument are described below: \nLoans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real Estate\n \nLoans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single property or a portfolio of properties, and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include: \n•\nMarket yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and changes in market indices, such as the CMBX (an index that tracks the performance of commercial mortgage bonds); \n•\nTransaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral; \n•\nA measure of expected future cash flows in a default scenario (recovery rates) implied by the value of the underlying collateral, which is mainly driven by current performance of the underlying collateral and capitalization rates. Recovery rates are expressed as a percentage of notional or face value of the instrument and reflect the benefit of credit enhancements on certain instruments; and \n•\nTiming of expected future cash flows (duration) which, in certain cases, may incorporate the impact of any loan forbearances and other unobservable inputs (e.g., prepayment speeds). \nLoans and Securities Backed by Residential Real Estate \nLoans and securities backed by residential real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by portfolios of residential real estate and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. Significant inputs include: \n•\nMarket yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets; \n•\nTransaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral; and\n•\nDuration, driven by underlying loan prepayment speeds and residential property liquidation timelines.\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n143\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCorporate Debt Instruments \nCorporate debt instruments includes corporate loans, debt securities and convertible debentures. Significant inputs for corporate debt instruments are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the same or similar issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available. Significant inputs include: \n•\nMarket yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and trends of market indices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks the performance of corporate credit);\n•\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions and, where the firm uses credit default swaps to value the related instrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n•\nDuration; and\n•\nMarket and transaction multiples for corporate debt instruments with convertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities \nEquity securities consists of private equities. Recent third-party completed or pending transactions (e.g., merger proposals, debt restructurings, tender offers) are considered the best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are not available, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate: \n•\nIndustry multiples (primarily EBITDA and revenue multiples) and public comparables;\n•\nTransactions in similar instruments;\n•\nDiscounted cash flow techniques; and\n•\nThird-party appraisals.\nThe firm also considers changes in the outlook for the relevant industry and financial performance of the issuer as compared to projected performance. Significant inputs include: \n•\nMarket and transaction multiples;\n•\nDiscount rates and capitalization rates; and\n•\nFor equity securities with debt-like features, market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets, current performance and recovery assumptions, and duration.\nOther Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans \nThe significant inputs to the valuation of other trading cash instruments, investments and loans are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available. Significant inputs include: \n•\nMarket yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and trends of market indices; \n•\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions and, where the firm uses credit default swaps to value the related instrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligation; and \n•\nDuration. \nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Derivatives \nThe firm’s level 2 and level 3 derivatives are valued using derivative pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow models, correlation models and models that incorporate option pricing methodologies, such as Monte Carlo simulations). Price transparency of derivatives can generally be characterized by product type, as described below. \n•\nInterest Rate.\n In general, the key inputs used to value interest rate derivatives are transparent, even for most long-dated contracts. Interest rate swaps and options denominated in the currencies of leading industrialized nations are characterized by high trading volumes and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest rate derivatives that reference indices, such as an inflation index, or the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year swap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are more complex, but the key inputs are generally observable. \n•\nCredit.\n Price transparency for credit default swaps, including both single names and baskets of credits, varies by market and underlying reference entity or obligation. Credit default swaps that reference indices, large corporates and major sovereigns generally exhibit the most price transparency. For credit default swaps with other underliers, price transparency varies based on credit rating, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligations, and the availability of the underlying reference obligations for delivery upon the default of the issuer. Credit default swaps that reference loans, asset-backed securities and emerging market debt instruments tend to have less price transparency than those that reference corporate bonds. In addition, more complex credit derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more underlying reference obligations, generally have less price transparency.\n144\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n•\nCurrency.\n \nPrices for currency derivatives based on the exchange rates of leading industrialized nations, including those with longer tenors, are generally transparent. The primary difference between the price transparency of developed and emerging market currency derivatives is that emerging markets tend to be only observable for contracts with shorter tenors.\n•\nCommodity.\n \nCommodity derivatives include transactions referenced to energy (e.g., oil, natural gas and electricity), metals (e.g., precious and base) and soft commodities (e.g., agricultural). Price transparency varies based on the underlying commodity, delivery location, tenor and product quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared to unleaded gasoline). In general, price transparency for commodity derivatives is greater for contracts with shorter tenors and contracts that are more closely aligned with major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n•\nEquity.\n \nPrice transparency for equity derivatives varies by market and underlier. Options on indices and the common stock of corporates included in major equity indices exhibit the most price transparency. Equity derivatives generally have observable market prices, except for contracts with long tenors or reference prices that differ significantly from current market prices. More complex equity derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more individual stocks, generally have less price transparency.\nLiquidity is essential to the observability of all product types. If transaction volumes decline, previously transparent prices and other inputs may become unobservable. Conversely, even highly structured products may at times have trading volumes large enough to provide observability of prices and other inputs.\nLevel 1.\n \nLevel 1 derivatives include short-term contracts for future delivery of securities when the underlying security is a level 1 instrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if they are actively traded and are valued at their quoted market price.\nLevel 2.\n \nLevel 2 derivatives include OTC derivatives for which all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by market evidence and exchange-traded derivatives that are not actively traded and/or that are valued using models that calibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives. \nThe selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends on the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model selection does not involve significant management judgment because outputs of models can be calibrated to market-clearing levels. \nValuation models require a variety of inputs, such as contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, discount rates (including those derived from interest rates on collateral received and posted as specified in credit support agreements for collateralized derivatives), credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs. Significant inputs to the valuations of level 2 derivatives can be verified to market transactions, broker or dealer quotations or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources. \nLevel 3\n. Level 3 derivatives are valued using models which utilize observable level 1 and/or level 2 inputs, as well as unobservable level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm’s level 3 derivatives are described below. \n•\nFor level 3 interest rate and currency derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include correlations of certain currencies and interest rates (e.g., the correlation between Euro inflation and Euro interest rates) and specific interest rate and currency volatilities. \n•\nFor level 3 credit derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include illiquid credit spreads and upfront credit points, which are unique to specific reference obligations and reference entities, and recovery rates. \n•\nFor level 3 commodity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include volatilities for options with strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices and prices or spreads for certain products for which the product quality or physical location of the commodity is not aligned with benchmark indices. \n•\nFor level 3 equity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs generally include equity volatility inputs for options that are long-dated and/or have strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices. In addition, the valuation of certain structured trades requires the use of level 3 correlation inputs, such as the correlation of the price performance of two or more individual stocks or the correlation of the price performance for a basket of stocks to another asset class, such as commodities. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n145\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflect observable market changes and any resulting gains and losses are classified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when corroborated by evidence, such as similar market transactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data. In circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value by reference to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. See Note 5 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of level 3 derivatives. \nValuation Adjustments.\n Valuation adjustments are integral to determining the fair value of derivative portfolios and are used to adjust the mid-market valuations produced by derivative pricing models to the exit price valuation. These adjustments incorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and funding valuation adjustments, which account for the credit and funding risk inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios. The firm also makes funding valuation adjustments to collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the firm to deliver or repledge collateral received. Market-based inputs are generally used when calibrating valuation adjustments to market-clearing levels. \nIn addition, for derivatives that include significant unobservable inputs, the firm makes model or exit price adjustments to account for the valuation uncertainty present in the transaction.\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Other Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value \nIn addition to trading cash instruments, derivatives, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value under the fair value option. Such instruments include repurchase agreements and substantially all resale agreements; certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions; certain customer and other receivables, including certain margin loans; certain time deposits, including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; substantially all other secured financings, including structured financing arrangements and transfers of assets accounted for as financings; certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments; and certain other assets and liabilities. These instruments are generally valued based on discounted cash flow techniques, which incorporate inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency, and are generally classified in level 2 because the inputs are observable. Valuation adjustments may be made for liquidity and for counterparty and the firm’s credit quality. The significant inputs used to value the firm’s other financial assets and liabilities are described below. \nResale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned.\n \nThe significant inputs to the valuation of resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and interest rates. \nCustomer and Other Receivables.\n The significant inputs to the valuation of receivables are interest rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and funding spreads. \nDeposits.\n \nThe significant inputs to the valuation of time deposits are interest rates and the amount and timing of future cash flows. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm’s other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 13 for further information about deposits. \nOther Secured Financings.\n \nThe significant inputs to the valuation of other secured financings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, funding spreads and the fair value of the collateral delivered by the firm (determined using the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market prices, market yields and recovery assumptions). See Note 11 for further information about other secured financings.\n \nUnsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings.\n \nThe significant inputs to the valuation of unsecured short- and long-term borrowings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, the credit spreads of the firm and commodity prices for prepaid commodity transactions. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm’s other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 14 for further information about borrowings. \nOther Assets and Liabilities.\n \nThe significant inputs to the valuation of other assets and liabilities are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, market yields, volatility and correlation inputs.

For example, the highest recovery rate for corporate debt instruments is appropriate for valuing a specific corporate debt instrument, but may not be appropriate for valuing any other corporate debt instrument. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 trading cash instruments. \n•\nIncreases in yield or duration used in the valuation of level 3 trading cash instruments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate or multiples would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2024 and December 2023. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 trading cash instrument, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type. \n•\nTrading cash instruments are valued using discounted cash flows. \n•\nThe significant unobservable inputs for multiples related to other trading cash instruments as of December 2024 did not have a range (and there was no weighted average) as it related to a single position.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n•\nAverages represent the arithmetic average of the inputs and are not weighted by the relative fair value or notional amount of the respective financial instruments. An average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average. For example, the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range. \n•\nThe ranges, averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative. For example, the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 derivatives.\n•\nInterest rates, currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models, credit derivatives are valued using option pricing, correlation and discounted cash flow models, and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models.\n•\nThe fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, option pricing models and discounted cash flow models are typically used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques. \n•\nCorrelation within currencies and equities includes cross-product type correlation. \n•\nNatural gas spread represents the spread per million British thermal units of natural gas.\n•\nOil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products. \n•\nElectricity price represents the price per megawatt hour of electricity.\nRange of Significant Unobservable Inputs. \nThe following provides information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm’s level 3 derivative instruments: \n•\nCorrelation.\n Ranges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type (e.g., equity index and equity single stock names) and across product types (e.g., correlation of an interest rate and a currency), as well as across regions. Generally, cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type.\n•\nVolatility.\n Ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets, maturities and strike prices. For example, volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks.\n•\nCredit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates.\n The ranges for credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers (index and single names), regions, sectors, maturities and credit qualities (high-yield and investment-grade). The broad range of this population gives rise to the width of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs. \n•\nCommodity prices and spreads.\n The ranges for commodity prices and spreads cover variability in products, maturities and delivery locations. \nSensitivity of Fair Value Measurement to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs. \nThe following is a description of the directional sensitivity of the firm’s level 3 fair value measurements to changes in significant unobservable inputs, in isolation, as of each period-end:\n•\nCorrelation.\n In general, for contracts where the holder benefits from the convergence of the underlying asset or index prices (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates and equity prices), an increase in correlation results in a higher fair value measurement. \n•\nVolatility.\n In general, for purchased options, an increase in volatility results in a higher fair value measurement. \n•\nCredit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates.\n In general, the fair value of purchased credit protection increases as credit spreads or upfront credit points increase or recovery rates decrease. Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates are strongly related to distinctive risk factors of the underlying reference obligations, which include reference entity-specific factors, such as leverage, volatility and industry, market-based risk factors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity of the underlying reference obligation, and macroeconomic conditions. \n•\nCommodity prices and spreads.\n In general, for contracts where the holder is receiving a commodity, an increase in the spread (price difference from a benchmark index due to differences in quality or delivery location) or price results in a higher fair value measurement. \nDue to the distinctive nature of each of the firm’s level 3 derivatives, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n151\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These ranges and weighted averages exclude unobservable inputs that are only relevant to a single instrument, and therefore are not meaningful. \nAs of December 2024: \n•\nYield: \n3.8\n% to \n12.3\n% (weighted average: \n8.9\n%) \n•\nDuration: \n2.0\n to \n5.4\n years (weighted average: \n2.9\n years) \nAs of December 2023: \n•\nYield: \n6.7\n% to \n11.3\n% (weighted average: \n8.5\n%) \n•\nDuration: \n0.1\n to \n4.5\n years (weighted average: \n0.9\n years) \nGenerally, increases in yield or duration, in isolation, would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement as of period-end. Due to the distinctive nature of each of level 3 other secured financings, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform across such financings. See Note 11 for further information about other secured financings. \nDeposits, Unsecured Borrowings and Other Assets and Liabilities. \nSubstantially all of the firm’s deposits, unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, and other assets and liabilities that are classified in level 3 are hybrid financial instruments.

Accordingly, gains or losses in one product type frequently offset gains or losses in other product types. For example, most of the firm’s longer-term derivatives across product types are sensitive to changes in interest rates and may be economically hedged with interest rate swaps. Similarly, a significant portion of the firm’s trading cash instruments and derivatives across product types has exposure to foreign currencies and may be economically hedged with foreign currency contracts.\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n161\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 7. \nDerivatives and Hedging Activities \nDerivative Activities \nDerivatives are instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors. Derivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange-traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as OTC derivatives. Certain of the firm’s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties (bilateral OTC). \nMarket Making.\n As a market maker, the firm enters into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. In this role, the firm typically acts as principal and is required to commit capital to provide execution, and maintains market-making positions in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand. \nRisk Management. \nThe firm also enters into derivatives to actively manage risk exposures that arise from its market-making and investing and financing activities. The firm’s holdings and exposures are hedged, in many cases, on either a portfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed to an instrument-by-instrument basis. The offsetting impact of this economic hedging is reflected in the same business segment as the related revenues. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to manage interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits and certain U.S. and non-U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale, foreign exchange risk of certain available-for-sale securities, the net investment in certain non-U.S. operations and the exposure to the variability of the forecasted cash flows associated with certain floating-rate assets.\nThe firm enters into various types of derivatives, including: \n•\nFutures and Forwards.\n Contracts that commit counterparties to purchase or sell financial instruments, commodities or currencies in the future. \n•\nSwaps.\n Contracts that require counterparties to exchange cash flows, such as currency or interest payment streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the specific terms of the contract with reference to specified rates, financial instruments, commodities, currencies or indices. \n•\nOptions.\n Contracts in which the option purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from or sell to the option writer financial instruments, commodities or currencies within a defined time period for a specified price. \nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). Derivative assets are included in \ntrading assets\n and derivative liabilities are included in \ntrading liabilities\n. \nRealized and unrealized gains and losses\n on derivatives not designated as hedges are included in market making (for derivatives included in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities within Global Banking & Markets), and other principal transactions (for derivatives included in Investment banking fees and Other within Global Banking & Markets, as well as derivatives in Asset & Wealth Management) in the consolidated statements of earnings. For both 2024 and 2023, substantially all of the firm’s derivatives were included in Global Banking & Markets.\n \n162\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm’s net risk position. Credit derivatives are generally individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity. \nThe firm enters into the following types of credit derivatives: \n•\nCredit Default Swaps.\n Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) in the event the issuer of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer. If a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer, calculated according to the terms of the contract.\n•\nCredit Options.\n In a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.\n164\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n•\nCredit Indices, Baskets and Tranches. \nCredit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction’s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions (tranches), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche. \n•\nTotal Return Swaps.\n A total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation. \nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit derivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased credit derivatives with identical underliers. Substantially all of the firm’s purchased credit derivative transactions are with financial institutions and are subject to stringent collateral thresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of a specified trigger event, the firm may take possession of the reference obligations underlying a particular written credit derivative, and consequently may, upon liquidation of the reference obligations, recover amounts on the underlying reference obligations in the event of default. \nThe table below presents information about credit derivatives. \n \nCredit Spread on Underlier (basis points)\n$ in millions\n0 - 250\n251 -\n 500\n501 -\n 1,000\nGreater\n than\n 1,000\nTotal\nAs of December 2024\n \n \n \n \n \nMaximum Payout/Notional Amount of Written Credit Derivatives by Tenor\nLess than 1 year\n$\n137,145\n \n$\n23,875\n \n$\n717\n \n$\n3,041\n \n$\n164,778\n \n1 - 5 years\n378,743\n \n15,349\n \n4,242\n \n6,194\n \n404,528\n \nGreater than 5 years\n29,196\n \n2,457\n \n471\n \n64\n \n32,188\n \nTotal\n$\n545,084\n \n$\n41,681\n \n$\n5,430\n \n$\n9,299\n \n$\n601,494\n \nMaximum Payout/Notional Amount of Purchased Credit Derivatives\nOffsetting\n$\n463,919\n \n$\n20,691\n \n$\n4,781\n \n$\n8,264\n \n$\n497,655\n \nOther\n165,662\n \n11,721\n \n1,879\n \n1,160\n \n180,422\n \nTotal\n$\n629,581\n \n$\n32,412\n \n$\n6,660\n \n$\n9,424\n \n$\n678,077\n \nFair Value of Written Credit Derivatives\nAsset\n$\n6,429\n \n$\n664\n \n$\n31\n \n$\n59\n \n$\n7,183\n \nLiability\n985\n \n314\n \n307\n \n1,138\n \n2,744\n \nNet asset/(liability)\n$\n5,444\n \n$\n350\n \n$\n(\n276\n)\n$\n(\n1,079\n)\n$\n4,439\n \nAs of December 2023\n \n \n \n \n \nMaximum Payout/Notional Amount of Written Credit Derivatives by Tenor\nLess than 1 year\n$\n126,667\n \n$\n12,594\n \n$\n892\n \n$\n3,611\n \n$\n143,764\n \n1 - 5 years\n324,577\n \n11,371\n \n5,613\n \n5,802\n \n347,363\n \nGreater than 5 years\n30,406\n \n1,316\n \n671\n \n249\n \n32,642\n \nTotal\n$\n481,650\n \n$\n25,281\n \n$\n7,176\n \n$\n9,662\n \n$\n523,769\n \nMaximum Payout/Notional Amount of Purchased Credit Derivatives\nOffsetting\n$\n396,984\n \n$\n11,857\n \n$\n6,241\n \n$\n8,246\n \n$\n423,328\n \nOther\n155,468\n \n12,862\n \n1,948\n \n1,619\n \n171,897\n \nTotal\n$\n552,452\n \n$\n24,719\n \n$\n8,189\n \n$\n9,865\n \n$\n595,225\n \nFair Value of Written Credit Derivatives\nAsset\n$\n11,147\n \n$\n654\n \n$\n221\n \n$\n165\n \n$\n12,187\n \nLiability\n1,723\n \n47\n \n201\n \n1,034\n \n3,005\n \nNet asset/(liability)\n$\n9,424\n \n$\n607\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n(\n869\n)\n$\n9,182\n \nIn the table above: \n•\nFair values exclude the effects of both netting of receivable balances with payable balances under enforceable netting agreements, and netting of cash received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements, and therefore are not representative of the firm’s credit exposure.\n•\nTenor is based on the remaining contractual maturity for substantially all written credit derivatives.\n•\nThe credit spread on the underlier, together with the tenor of the contract, are indicators of payment/performance risk.

These gains or losses also include funding valuation adjustments (FVA) relating to uncollateralized derivative assets, which represent the gains or losses (including hedges) attributable to the impact of changes in expected funding exposures and funding spreads. \nThe table below presents information about CVA and FVA. \nYear Ended December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCVA, net of hedges\n$\n187\n \n$\n(\n139\n)\n$\n320\n \nFVA, net of hedges\n142\n \n131\n \n(\n193\n)\nTotal\n$\n329\n \n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n127\n \nBifurcated Embedded Derivatives \nThe table below presents the fair value and the notional amount of derivatives that have been bifurcated from their related borrowings. \n \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nFair value of assets\n$\n467\n \n$\n450\n \nFair value of liabilities\n(\n175\n)\n(\n307\n)\nNet asset/(liability)\n$\n292\n \n$\n143\n \n \nNotional amount\n$\n8,106\n \n$\n8,082\n \nIn the table above, derivatives that have been bifurcated from their related borrowings are recorded at fair value and primarily consist of interest rate, equity and commodity products. These derivatives are included in unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, as well as other secured financings, with the related borrowings. \nDerivatives with Credit-Related Contingent Features\n \nCertain of the firm’s derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require the firm to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in the firm’s credit ratings. The firm assesses the impact of these bilateral agreements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would occur assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency’s relative ratings of the firm at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies.\n \nThe table below presents information about net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements (excluding collateral posted), the fair value of collateral posted and additional collateral or termination payments that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in the firm’s credit ratings. \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nNet derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements\n$\n31,575\n \n$\n30,021\n \nCollateral posted\n$\n20,262\n \n$\n20,758\n \nAdditional collateral or termination payments:\nOne-notch downgrade\n$\n315\n \n$\n271\n \nTwo-notch downgrade\n$\n1,200\n \n$\n1,584\n \nHedge Accounting \nThe firm applies hedge accounting for (i) interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term borrowings, certain fixed-rate certificates of deposit and certain U.S. and non-U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale, (ii) foreign currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange risk of certain securities classified as available-for-sale, (iii) foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt used to manage foreign exchange risk on the firm’s net investment in certain non-U.S. operations and (iv) interest rate swaps used to manage the variability of the forecasted cash flows associated with certain floating-rate assets.\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging instrument must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged. Additionally, the firm must formally document the hedging relationship at inception and assess the hedging relationship at least on a quarterly basis to ensure the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective over the life of the hedging relationship. \nFair Value Hedges \nThe firm designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term debt and fixed-rate certificates of deposit and of certain U.S. and non-U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale. These interest rate swaps hedge changes in fair value attributable to the designated benchmark interest rate (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Overnight Index Swap Rate or Sterling Overnight Index Average), effectively converting a substantial portion of these fixed-rate financial instruments into floating-rate financial instruments. \nThe firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression analysis when assessing the effectiveness of these hedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument and the risk being hedged (i.e., interest rate risk). An interest rate swap is considered highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%. \n166\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor qualifying interest rate fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivatives are included in interest income/expense. The change in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value (hedging adjustment) and is also included in interest income/expense. When a derivative is no longer designated as a hedge, any remaining difference between the carrying value and par value of the hedged item is amortized in interest income/expense over the remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest method. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.\n \nThe table below presents the gains/(losses) from interest rate derivatives accounted for as hedges and the related hedged items. \nYear Ended December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInvestments\nInterest rate hedges\n$\n63\n \n$\n(\n109\n)\n$\n366\n \nHedged investments\n(\n80\n)\n111\n \n(\n350\n)\nGains/(losses)\n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n2\n \n$\n16\n \nBorrowings and deposits\nInterest rate hedges\n$\n(\n581\n)\n$\n3,859\n \n$\n(\n22,183\n)\nHedged borrowings and deposits\n181\n \n(\n4,344\n)\n21,662\n \nGains/(losses)\n$\n(\n400\n)\n$\n(\n485\n)\n$\n(\n521\n)\nThe table below presents the carrying value of investments, deposits and unsecured borrowings that are designated in an interest rate hedging relationship and the related cumulative hedging adjustment (increase/(decrease)) from current and prior hedging relationships included in such carrying values. \n$ in millions\nCarrying\n Value\nCumulative\n Hedging\n Adjustment\nAs of December 2024\nAssets\nInvestments\n$\n34,755\n \n$\n(\n279\n)\nLiabilities\nDeposits\n$\n1,840\n \n$\n(\n52\n)\nUnsecured short-term borrowings\n$\n14,720\n \n$\n(\n113\n)\nUnsecured long-term borrowings\n$\n130,161\n \n$\n(\n10,757\n)\nAs of December 2023\nAssets\nInvestments\n$\n16,523\n \n$\n(\n104\n)\nLiabilities\nDeposits\n$\n3,435\n \n$\n(\n123\n)\nUnsecured short-term borrowings\n$\n14,449\n \n$\n(\n94\n)\nUnsecured long-term borrowings\n$\n134,992\n \n$\n(\n10,810\n)\nIn the table above: \n•\nCumulative hedging adjustment included $(\n5.81\n) billion as of December 2024 and $(\n5.63\n) billion as of December 2023 of hedging adjustments from prior hedging relationships that were de-designated and substantially all were related to unsecured long-term borrowings. \n•\nThe amortized cost of investments was\n \n$\n35.29\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n17.33\n billion as of December 2023.\nIn addition, cumulative hedging adjustments for items no longer designated in a hedging relationship were \nno\nt material as of both December 2024 and December 2023. \nThe firm designates certain foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges of the foreign exchange risk of non-U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale. See Note 8 for information about the amortized cost and fair value of such securities. The effectiveness of such hedges is assessed based on changes in spot rates. The gains/(losses) on the hedges (relating to both spot and forward points) and the foreign exchange gains/(losses) on the related available-for-sale securities are included in market making. The net gains/(losses) on hedges and the related hedged available-for-sale securities were \nno\nt material for 2024, were $(\n2\n) million (reflecting a loss of $\n127\n million related to hedges and a gain of $\n125\n million on the related hedged available-for-sale securities) for 2023 and were $(\n30\n) million (reflecting a gain of $\n266\n million related to hedges and a loss of $\n296\n million on the related hedged available-for-sale securities) for 2022.\nNet Investment Hedges\n \nThe firm seeks to reduce the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on its net investments in certain non-U.S. operations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on the overall changes in the fair value of the forward contracts (i.e., based on changes in forward rates). For foreign currency-denominated debt designated as a hedge, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on changes in spot rates. For qualifying net investment hedges, all gains or losses on the hedging instruments are included in currency translation. \nThe table below presents the gains/(losses) from net investment hedging. \nYear Ended December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nHedges:\nForeign currency forward contracts\n$\n1,064\n \n$\n(\n276\n)\n$\n1,713\n \nForeign currency-denominated debt\n$\n1,633\n \n$\n(\n550\n)\n$\n(\n269\n)\nGains or losses on individual net investments in non-U.S. operations are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) to earnings when such net investments are sold or substantially liquidated.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCash Flow Hedges\n \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, the firm designated certain interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. These interest rate swaps hedge the firm’s exposure to the variability of the forecasted cash flows due to changes in the contractually specified interest rates associated with certain floating-rate assets. \nThe firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression analysis when assessing hedge effectiveness. A cash flow hedge is considered highly effective in offsetting the variability of the forecasted cash flows attributable to the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%. \nFor qualifying cash flow hedges, the gains or losses on derivatives are included in “Cash flow hedges” within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Such gains or losses are reclassified to interest income/expense within the consolidated statements of earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. \nThe gains/(losses) included within other comprehensive income/(loss) and the gains/(losses) reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) related to cash flow hedges were not material for 2024 and are not expected to be material for 2025. The maximum length of time over which the forecasted cash flows are hedged is approximately one year.\nNote 8. \nInvestments \nInvestments includes debt securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity that are generally held in connection with the firm’s asset-liability management activities. In addition, investments includes equity securities and debt instruments that are accounted for at fair value and equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method that are generally held by the firm in connection with its long-term investing activities. \nThe table below presents information about investments. \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nAvailable-for-sale securities, at fair value\n$\n79,458\n \n$\n49,141\n \nHeld-to-maturity securities\n78,713\n \n70,310\n \nEquity securities, at fair value\n13,832\n \n13,747\n \nDebt instruments, at fair value\n11,452\n \n12,879\n \nEquity-method investments\n1,059\n \n762\n \nTotal other investments\n26,343\n \n27,388\n \nTotal investments\n$\n184,514\n \n$\n146,839\n \nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, as the balances have increased during the year, investments are further disaggregated between available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities and other investments in the consolidated balance sheets and the related cash flows are disaggregated in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

If the firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, the difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance, if any) and the fair value of the securities is recognized as an impairment loss in earnings. The firm did not record any such impairment losses during either 2024 or 2023. Impaired available-for-sale debt securities that the firm has the intent and ability to hold are reviewed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded. The firm considers various factors in such determination, including market conditions, changes in issuer credit ratings and severity of the unrealized losses.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following is a description of the loan types in the table above: \n•\nCorporate. \nCorporate loans includes term loans, revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and bridge loans, and are principally used for operating and general corporate purposes, or in connection with acquisitions. Corporate loans are secured (typically by a senior lien on the assets of the borrower) or unsecured, depending on the loan purpose, the risk profile of the borrower and other factors. \n•\nCommercial Real Estate.\n Commercial real estate loans includes originated loans that are directly or indirectly secured by hotels, retail stores, multifamily housing complexes and commercial and industrial properties. Commercial real estate loans also includes loans extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly backed by commercial real estate. In addition, commercial real estate includes loans purchased by the firm. \n•\nResidential Real Estate.\n Residential real estate loans primarily includes loans extended to wealth management clients and to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by residential real estate. In addition, residential real estate includes loans purchased by the firm.\n•\nSecurities-Based. \nSecurities-based loans includes loans that are secured by stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds. These loans are primarily extended to the firm’s wealth management clients and used for purposes other than purchasing, carrying or trading margin stocks. Securities-based loans require borrowers to post additional collateral on a daily basis (daily margin requirement) based on changes in the underlying collateral’s fair value.\n•\nOther Collateralized.\n Other collateralized loans includes loans that are backed by specific collateral (other than securities-based loans where there is a daily margin requirement and real estate loans). Such loans are extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by corporate loans, consumer loans and other assets. Other collateralized loans also includes loans to investment funds (managed by third parties) that are collateralized by capital commitments of the funds’ investors or assets held by the fund, as well as other secured loans extended to the firm’s wealth management and corporate clients.\n \n•\nInstallment.\n Installment loans are unsecured loans that were originated by the firm. \n•\nCredit Cards.\n Credit card loans are loans made pursuant to revolving lines of credit issued to consumers by the firm. \n•\nOther.\n Other loans primarily includes unsecured loans extended to wealth management clients and unsecured consumer loans purchased by the firm. \nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of loans, and Note 5 for information about loans within the fair value hierarchy.\nCredit Quality\n \nRisk Assessment. \nThe firm’s risk assessment process includes evaluating the credit quality of its loans by Risk. For corporate loans and a majority of securities-based, real estate, other collateralized and other loans, the firm performs credit analyses which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a borrower to meet its financial obligations. These credit evaluations are performed on an annual basis or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances. The firm determines an internal credit rating for the borrower by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the borrower’s industry and the economic environment. For collateralized loans, the firm also takes into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements when determining an internal credit rating. For consumer loans and for loans that are not assigned an internal credit rating, including U.S. residential mortgage loans extended to wealth management clients, the firm reviews certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, loan to value ratios, delinquency status, collateral value and other risk factors. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n173\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

At that time, all accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income and interest subsequently collected is recognized on a cash basis to the extent the loan balance is deemed collectible.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAllowance for Credit Losses \nThe firm’s allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost. Loans and lending commitments accounted for at fair value or accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value are not subject to an allowance for credit losses. \nTo determine the allowance for credit losses, the firm classifies its loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which the firm has developed and documented its methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. \nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loans and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a \nthree-year\n period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios described below. The firm applies judgment in weighing individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including the firm’s internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. \nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The qualitative factors considered by management include, among others, changes and trends in loan portfolios, uncertainties associated with the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, credit concentrations, changes in volume and severity of past due and criticized loans, idiosyncratic events and deterioration within an industry or region. \nManagement’s estimate of credit losses entails judgment about the expected life of the loan and loan collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves senior management within Risk and Controllers. Personnel within Risk are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While management uses the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. \nThe table below presents gross loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost by portfolio. \nAs of December\n2024\n2023\n$ in millions\nLoans\nLending\n Commitments\nLoans\nLending\n Commitments\nWholesale\nCorporate\n$\n28,689\n \n$\n156,562\n \n$\n33,866\n \n$\n141,976\n \nCommercial real estate\n28,899\n \n4,969\n \n25,025\n \n3,379\n \nResidential real estate\n22,243\n \n1,742\n \n21,243\n \n1,431\n \nSecurities-based \n16,477\n \n1,542\n \n14,621\n \n691\n \nOther collateralized \n74,008\n \n33,136\n \n61,105\n \n23,020\n \nOther\n1,950\n \n872\n \n1,333\n \n888\n \nConsumer\nInstallment\n–\n \n–\n \n250\n \n1\n \nCredit cards\n19,615\n \n63,781\n \n17,432\n \n56,479\n \nTotal\n$\n191,881\n \n$\n262,604\n \n$\n174,875\n \n$\n227,865\n \nIn the table above, wholesale loans included $\n3.65\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n4.14\n billion as of December 2023 of nonaccrual loans for which the allowance for credit losses was measured on an asset-specific basis.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following is a description of the methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses: \nWholesale.\n The allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans and lending commitments that exhibit similar risk characteristics is measured using a modeled approach. These models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. For lending commitments, the methodology also considers the probability of drawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans and lending commitments include unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices. \nThe allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrual loans, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective rate, the observable market price of the loan, or, in the case of collateral dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, if applicable. Wholesale loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\nConsumer.\n The allowance for credit losses for consumer loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is calculated using a modeled approach which classifies consumer loans into pools based on borrower-related and exposure-related characteristics that differentiate a pool’s risk characteristics from other pools. The factors considered in determining a pool are generally consistent with the risk characteristics used for internal credit risk measurement and management and include key metrics, such as FICO credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for consumer loans include unemployment rates and delinquency rates. The expected life of revolving credit card loans is determined by modeling expected future draws and the timing and amount of repayments allocated to the funded balance. The firm does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on credit card lending commitments as they are cancellable by the firm. \nCredit card loans are charged off when they are 180 days past due. Installment loans were charged off when they were 120 days past due. \nAllowance for Credit Losses Rollforward \nThe table below presents information about the allowance for credit losses. \n$ in millions\nWholesale \nConsumer \nTotal \nYear Ended December 2024\nAllowance for loan losses\nBeginning balance\n$\n2,576\n \n$\n2,474\n \n$\n5,050\n \nCharge-offs\n(\n169\n)\n(\n1,471\n)\n(\n1,640\n)\nRecoveries\n121\n \n104\n \n225\n \nNet (charge-offs)/recoveries\n(\n48\n)\n(\n1,367\n)\n(\n1,415\n)\nProvision\n(\n292\n)\n1,540\n \n1,248\n \nOther\n(\n137\n)\n(\n80\n)\n(\n217\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n2,099\n \n$\n2,567\n \n$\n4,666\n \nAllowance ratio\n1.2\n \n%\n13.1\n \n%\n2.4\n \n%\nNet charge-off ratio\n–\n \n7.6\n \n%\n0.8\n \n%\nAllowance for losses on lending commitments\nBeginning balance\n$\n620\n \n$\n–\n \n$\n620\n \nProvision\n56\n \n–\n \n56\n \nOther\n(\n2\n)\n–\n \n(\n2\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n674\n \n$\n–\n \n$\n674\n \nYear Ended December 2023\nAllowance for loan losses\nBeginning balance\n$\n2,562\n \n$\n2,981\n \n$\n5,543\n \nCharge-offs\n(\n455\n)\n(\n1,246\n)\n(\n1,701\n)\nRecoveries\n55\n \n98\n \n153\n \nNet (charge-offs)/recoveries\n(\n400\n)\n(\n1,148\n)\n(\n1,548\n)\nProvision\n540\n \n641\n \n1,181\n \nOther\n(\n126\n)\n–\n \n(\n126\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n2,576\n \n$\n2,474\n \n$\n5,050\n \nAllowance ratio\n1.6\n \n%\n14.0\n \n%\n2.9\n \n%\nNet charge-off ratio\n0.3\n \n%\n5.5\n \n%\n0.9\n \n%\nAllowance for losses on lending commitments\nBeginning balance\n$\n711\n \n$\n63\n \n$\n774\n \nProvision\n(\n90\n)\n(\n63\n)\n(\n153\n)\nOther\n(\n1\n)\n–\n \n(\n1\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n620\n \n$\n–\n \n$\n620\n \nIn the table above: \n•\nOther primarily represented the reduction to the allowance related to loans transferred to held for sale. \n•\nThe allowance ratio is calculated by dividing the allowance for loan losses by gross loans accounted for at amortized cost. \n•\nThe net charge-off ratio is calculated by dividing net (charge-offs)/recoveries by average gross loans accounted for at amortized cost.\n \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n179\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Given the complex nature of the forecasting process, no single economic variable can be viewed in isolation and independently of other inputs.\n \nAllowance for Credit Losses Commentary \nYear Ended December 2024.\n The allowance for credit losses decreased by $\n330\n million during 2024, primarily reflecting a reserve release relating to the wholesale portfolio due to improved macroeconomic environment, partially offset by growth in the credit card portfolio.\nCharge-offs for 2024 for wholesale loans (principally related to term loans originated in 2022 and 2021) were primarily related to corporate loans and charge-offs for consumer loans were primarily related to credit cards.\nYear Ended December 2023.\n The allowance for credit losses decreased by $\n647\n million during 2023, reflecting a net release related to the GreenSky installment loan portfolio (including a reserve reduction of $\n637\n million related to the partial sale and transfer of the portfolio to held for sale), a reserve reduction of $\n442\n million associated with the sale of Marcus loans, a reserve reduction of $\n160\n million related to the transfer of the GM co-branded credit card portfolio to held for sale, a reserve release in the consumer portfolio based on actual repayment experience and lower balances in corporate loans due to sales and paydowns, partially offset by asset-specific provisions and ratings downgrades in the wholesale portfolio and seasoning of the credit card portfolio.  \nCharge-offs for 2023 for wholesale loans (principally related to term loans originated in 2021 and revolving loans) were primarily related to corporate loans and charge-offs for consumer loans were primarily related to credit cards. \n \nEstimated Fair Value \nThe table below presents the estimated fair value of loans that are not accounted for at fair value and in what level of the fair value hierarchy they would have been classified if they had been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy. \n \nCarrying Value\nEstimated Fair Value\n$ in millions\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAs of December 2024\n \n \n \n \nAmortized cost\n$\n187,215\n \n$\n99,790\n \n$\n89,540\n \n$\n189,330\n \nHeld for sale\n$\n3,525\n \n$\n2,928\n \n$\n600\n \n$\n3,528\n \nAs of December 2023\n \n \n \n \nAmortized cost\n$\n169,825\n \n$\n88,485\n \n$\n83,288\n \n$\n171,773\n \nHeld for sale\n$\n7,027\n \n$\n3,992\n \n$\n3,038\n \n$\n7,030\n \nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of loans, and Note 5 for information about loans within the fair value hierarchy.\n180\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 10. \nFair Value Option \nOther Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value \nIn addition to trading assets and liabilities, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value, substantially all under the fair value option. The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to: \n•\nReflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis; \n•\nMitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes (e.g., transfers of financial assets accounted for as financings are recorded at fair value, whereas the related secured financing would be recorded on an accrual basis absent electing the fair value option); and \n•\nAddress simplification and cost-benefit considerations (e.g., accounting for hybrid financial instruments at fair value in their entirety versus bifurcation of embedded derivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts). \nHybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain bifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not require settlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g., physical commodities). Unless the firm has elected to account for the entire hybrid financial instrument at fair value under the fair value option, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the associated host contract, the derivative is accounted for at fair value and the host contract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for the effective portion of any fair value hedges. \nOther financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option include: \n•\nRepurchase agreements and substantially all resale agreements; \n•\nCertain securities borrowed and loaned transactions; \n•\nCertain customer and other receivables and certain other assets and liabilities; \n•\nCertain time deposits (deposits with no stated maturity are not eligible for a fair value option election), including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; \n•\nSubstantially all other secured financings, including structured financing arrangements and transfers of assets accounted for as financings; and \n•\nCertain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments. \nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities, and Note 5 for information about other financial assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.\nGains and Losses on Other Financial Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value Under the Fair Value Option \nThe table below presents the gains and losses recognized in earnings as a result of the election to apply the fair value option to certain financial assets and liabilities. \nYear Ended December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnsecured short-term borrowings\n$\n(\n2,749\n)\n$\n(\n4,341\n)\n$\n4,055\n \nUnsecured long-term borrowings\n(\n3,295\n)\n(\n4,937\n)\n6,506\n \nOther\n(\n356\n)\n(\n513\n)\n1,072\n \nTotal\n$\n(\n6,400\n)\n$\n(\n9,791\n)\n$\n11,633\n \nIn the table above: \n•\nGains/(losses) were substantially all included in market making. \n•\nGains/(losses) exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense, for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense. \n•\nGains/(losses) included in unsecured short- and long-term borrowings were substantially all related to the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments. These gains and losses would have been recognized under other U.S. GAAP even if the firm had not elected to account for the entire hybrid financial instrument at fair value. \n•\nGains/(losses) included in other were primarily related to resale and repurchase agreements, deposits and other secured financings.\n•\nOther financial assets and liabilities at fair value are frequently economically hedged with trading assets and liabilities. Accordingly, gains or losses on such other financial assets and liabilities can be partially offset by gains or losses on trading assets and liabilities. As a result, gains or losses on other financial assets and liabilities do not necessarily represent the overall impact on the firm’s results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n181\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGains/(losses) on trading assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option are included in market making. See Note 6 for further information about gains/(losses) from market making. See Note 8 for information about gains/(losses) on equity securities and Note 9 for information about gains/(losses) on loans which are accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\nLong-Term Debt Instruments \nThe difference between the aggregate contractual principal amount and the related fair value of long-term other secured financings, for which the fair value option was elected was not material as of December 2024, and the aggregate contractual principal amount exceeded the fair value by $\n147\n million as of December 2023. \nThe aggregate contractual principal amount of unsecured long-term borrowings, for which the fair value option was elected, exceeded the related fair value by $\n4.23\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n3.37\n billion as of December 2023. \nThese debt instruments include both principal-protected and non-principal-protected long-term borrowings. \nDebt Valuation Adjustment \nThe firm calculates the fair value of financial liabilities for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the firm’s credit spreads. \nThe table below presents information about the net debt valuation adjustment (DVA) gains/(losses) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. \nYear Ended December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPre-tax DVA\n$\n(\n351\n)\n$\n(\n1,355\n)\n$\n1,882\n \nAfter-tax DVA\n$\n(\n263\n)\n$\n(\n1,015\n)\n$\n1,403\n \nIn the table above: \n•\nAfter-tax DVA is included in debt valuation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. \n•\nThe gains/(losses) reclassified to market making in the consolidated statements of earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) upon extinguishment of such financial liabilities were not material for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nLoans and Lending Commitments \nThe table below presents the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate contractual principal amount for loans (included in trading assets and loans in the consolidated balance sheets) for which the fair value option was elected. \n \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nPerforming loans\n \n \nAggregate contractual principal in excess of fair value\n$\n965\n \n$\n1,893\n \nLoans on nonaccrual status and/or more than 90 days past due\nAggregate contractual principal in excess of fair value\n$\n2,402\n \n$\n2,305\n \nAggregate fair value\n$\n1,454\n \n$\n1,508\n \nIn the table above, the aggregate contractual principal amount of loans on nonaccrual status and/or more than 90 days past due (which excludes loans carried at zero fair value and considered uncollectible) exceeds the related fair value primarily because the firm regularly purchases loans, such as distressed loans, at values significantly below the contractual principal amounts.\n \nThe total contractual amount of unfunded lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $\n568\n million as of December 2024 and $\n878\n million as of December 2023, and the related fair value of these lending commitments was not material as of both December 2024 and December 2023. See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments. \nImpact of Credit Spreads on Loans and Lending Commitments \nThe estimated net loss attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads on loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was not material for 2024, $\n125\n million for 2023 and $\n281\n million for 2022. \nThe firm generally calculates the fair value of loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the instrument-specific credit spreads. For floating-rate loans and lending commitments, substantially all changes in fair value are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads, whereas for fixed-rate loans and lending commitments, changes in fair value are also attributable to changes in interest rates.\n \n182\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 11.\n \nCollateralized Agreements and Financings \nCollateralized agreements are resale agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings are repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. The firm enters into these transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain firm activities. \nCollateralized agreements and financings with the same settlement date are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements. Interest on collateralized agreements, which is included in interest income, and collateralized financings, which is included in interest expense, is recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense. \nResale and Repurchase Agreements\n \nA resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm purchases financial instruments from a seller, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. \nA repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. \nEven though repurchase and resale agreements (including “repos- and reverses-to-maturity”) involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the financial instruments to be repurchased or resold before or at the maturity of the agreement. The financial instruments purchased or sold in resale and repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and agency obligations, and investment-grade sovereign obligations. \nThe firm receives financial instruments purchased under resale agreements and makes delivery of financial instruments sold under repurchase agreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these financial instruments on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the financial instruments, as appropriate. For resale agreements, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the relevant assets in the consolidated balance sheets. \nRepurchase agreements and substantially all resale agreements are recorded at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 5 for further information about repurchase and resale agreements.\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions\n \nIn a securities borrowed transaction, the firm borrows securities from a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the firm returns the securities, the counterparty returns the cash or securities. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction. \nIn a securities loaned transaction, the firm lends securities to a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the counterparty returns the securities, the firm returns the cash or securities posted as collateral. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction. \nIn a transaction where the firm lends securities and receives securities that can be delivered or pledged as collateral, the firm recognizes the securities received within securities borrowed and the obligation to return those securities within securities loaned in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe firm receives securities borrowed and makes delivery of securities loaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these securities on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the securities, as appropriate. For securities borrowed transactions, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the securities borrowed transaction. \nSecurities borrowed and loaned within FICC financing are recorded at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 5 for further information about securities borrowed and loaned accounted for at fair value. \nSubstantially all of the securities borrowed and loaned within Equities financing are recorded based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or received plus accrued interest. The firm also reviews such securities borrowed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded by taking into consideration the fair value of collateral received. As these agreements generally can be terminated on demand, they exhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the carrying value of such agreements approximates fair value. As these agreements are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these agreements been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2024 and December 2023.\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n183\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOther Secured Financings \nIn addition to repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, the firm funds certain assets through the use of other secured financings and pledges financial instruments and other assets as collateral in these transactions. These other secured financings include: \n•\nLiabilities of CIEs and consolidated VIEs; \n•\nTransfers of assets accounted for as financings rather than sales (e.g., pledged commodities, bank loans and mortgage whole loans); and \n•\nOther structured financing arrangements. \nOther secured financings included nonrecourse arrangements. Nonrecourse other secured financings were $\n3.74\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n5.57\n billion as of December 2023.\nThe firm has elected to apply the fair value option to substantially all other secured financings because the use of fair value eliminates non-economic volatility in earnings that would arise from using different measurement attributes. See Note 5 for further information about other secured financings that are accounted for at fair value. \nOther secured financings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these financings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm tests property, leasehold improvements and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. Any impairments recognized are included in depreciation and amortization. The firm had impairments of $\n228\n million during 2024 and $\n314\n million during 2022, substantially all related to commercial real estate included in CIEs within Asset & Wealth Management. During 2023, the firm had impairments of $\n1.46\n billion related to commercial real estate included in CIEs within Asset & Wealth Management and $\n118\n million related to capitalized software substantially all within Platform Solutions and Asset & Wealth Management.\n \nGoodwill\n \nGoodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.\n \nThe table below presents the carrying value of goodwill by reporting unit. \n \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nGlobal Banking & Markets:\nInvestment banking\n$\n267\n \n$\n267\n \nFICC\n269\n \n269\n \nEquities\n2,647\n \n2,647\n \nAsset & Wealth Management:\nAsset management\n1,361\n \n1,410\n \nWealth management\n1,309\n \n1,309\n \nPlatform Solutions:\n \n \nTransaction banking and other\n–\n \n14\n \nTotal\n$\n5,853\n \n$\n5,916\n \nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment.\nThe quantitative goodwill test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value (including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets). If the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. An impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value and any such impairment is included in depreciation and amortization. \nWhen performing a quantitative goodwill test, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is based on valuation techniques the firm believes market participants would use to value these reporting units. Estimated fair values are generally derived from utilizing a relative value technique, which applies observable price-to-earnings multiples or price-to-book multiples of comparable competitors to the reporting units’ net earnings or net book value, or a discounted cash flow valuation approach, for reporting units with businesses in early stages of development. The carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders’ equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders’ equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. \nDuring the third quarter of 2024, in connection with the planned sale of the firm’s seller financing loan portfolio, the firm performed a quantitative goodwill test and determined that the goodwill associated with Transaction banking and other was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a $\n14\n million impairment. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the firm performed its annual assessment of goodwill for impairment, for each of its reporting units with goodwill, by performing a qualitative assessment. Multiple factors were assessed with respect to each of these reporting units to determine whether it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of those reporting units was less than its carrying value. \nThe firm considered the following factors in the qualitative annual assessment:\n•\nPerformance Indicators.\n During 2024, the firm’s net revenues, efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues), diluted earnings per common share (EPS), return on average common shareholders’ equity and book value per common share all improved from 2023 and from 2022 (when a quantitative test was last performed). Within the reporting units with goodwill, there continued to be solid fundamentals underlying our businesses, where the firm continued to maintain industry leadership positions and execute on strategic goals.\n•\nMacroeconomic Indicators.\n Despite broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, the global economy continued to grow in 2024.\n•\nFirm and Industry Events.\n There were no events, entity-specific or otherwise, that would have had a significant negative impact on the valuation of the firm’s reporting units with goodwill.  \n•\nFair Value Indicators.\n Fair value indicators for both the firm and its peers have generally improved since the annual assessment performed in 2023 and from 2022 (when a quantitative test was last performed).\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n187\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAs a result of the annual assessment, the firm determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill exceeded its respective carrying value. Therefore, the firm determined that goodwill for each reporting unit was not impaired and that a quantitative goodwill test was not required.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\n \nThe table below presents identifiable intangible assets by type. \n \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nCustomer lists\n \n \nGross carrying value\n$\n2,187\n \n$\n2,339\n \nAccumulated amortization\n(\n1,358\n)\n(\n1,292\n)\nNet carrying value\n829\n \n1,047\n \nOther\n \n \nGross carrying value\n82\n \n866\n \nAccumulated amortization\n(\n64\n)\n(\n736\n)\nNet carrying value\n18\n \n130\n \nTotal gross carrying value\n2,269\n \n3,205\n \nTotal accumulated amortization\n(\n1,422\n)\n(\n2,028\n)\nTotal net carrying value\n$\n847\n \n$\n1,177\n \nIn the table above:\n•\nThe decrease in the net carrying value of identifiable intangible assets from December 2023 to December 2024 reflected a $\n110\n million reduction due to the sale of GreenSky Holdings, LLC (GreenSky) and a $\n72\n million write-down in connection with the classification of the GM credit card program (included within Platform Solutions) as held for sale in 2024. \n•\nSubstantially all of the firm’s identifiable intangible assets have finite useful lives and are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method.\n \nThe tables below present information about the amortization of identifiable intangible assets.\nYear Ended December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmortization\n$\n176\n \n$\n681\n \n$\n174\n \nIn the table above, amortization for 2024 included the write-down related to the GM credit card program noted above.

To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.\n Other than as noted above, there were no material impairments or write-downs during each of 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nOperating Lease Right-of-Use Assets \nThe firm enters into operating leases for real estate, office equipment and other assets, substantially all of which are used in connection with its operations. For leases longer than one year, the firm recognizes a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments. The lease term is generally determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease. For leases where the firm has the option to terminate or extend the lease, an assessment of the likelihood of exercising the option is incorporated into the determination of the lease term. Such assessment is initially performed at the inception of the lease and is updated if events occur that impact the original assessment. \nAn operating lease right-of-use asset is initially determined based on the operating lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease incentives and amounts paid at or prior to lease commencement. This amount is then amortized over the lease term.\n Right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities recognized (in non-cash transactions for leases entered into or assumed) by the firm were $\n167\n million for 2024, $\n333\n million for 2023 and $\n256\n million for 2022. See Note 15 for information about operating lease liabilities. \nFor leases where the firm will derive no economic benefit from leased space that it has vacated or where the firm has shortened the term of a lease when space is no longer needed, the firm will record an impairment or accelerated amortization of right-of-use assets. \nThere were no material impairments or accelerated amortizations during each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n188\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJunior Subordinated Debt \nIn 2004, Group Inc. issued $\n2.84\n billion of junior subordinated debt to Goldman Sachs Capital I, a Delaware statutory trust. Goldman Sachs Capital I issued $\n2.75\n billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests (Trust Preferred securities) to third parties and $\n85\n million of common beneficial interests to Group Inc. As of both December 2024 and December 2023, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by Goldman Sachs Capital I was $\n968\n million and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred securities and common beneficial interests issued by Goldman Sachs Capital I was $\n939\n million and $\n29\n million, respectively. Goldman Sachs Capital I is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but is not consolidated for accounting purposes. \nThe firm pays interest semi-annually on the junior subordinated debt at an annual rate of \n6.345\n% and the debt matures on February 15, 2034. The coupon rate and the payment dates applicable to the beneficial interests are the same as the interest rate and payment dates for the junior subordinated debt. The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt, and therefore cause payment on Goldman Sachs Capital I’s preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in each case up to \nten\n consecutive semi-annual periods. During any such deferral period, the firm will not be permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its common stock. Goldman Sachs Capital I is not permitted to pay any distributions on the common beneficial interests held by Group Inc. unless all dividends payable on the preferred beneficial interests have been paid in full.\n \nNote 15. \nOther Liabilities\n \nThe table below presents other liabilities by type. \n \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nCompensation and benefits\n$\n8,770\n \n$\n7,804\n \nIncome tax-related liabilities\n3,544\n \n2,947\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n2,062\n \n2,232\n \nNoncontrolling interests\n401\n \n363\n \nEmployee interests in consolidated funds\n16\n \n19\n \nAccrued expenses and other \n9,427\n \n10,438\n \nTotal\n$\n24,220\n \n$\n23,803\n \nOperating Lease Liabilities \nFor leases longer than one year, the firm recognizes a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments.

Variable lease costs, which are included in operating lease costs, were not material for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022. Total occupancy expenses for space held in excess of the firm’s current requirements were not material for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nLease payments relating to operating lease arrangements that were signed but had not yet commenced were $\n1.10\n billion as of December 2024. \n192\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See Note 17 for further information about these investments.\nNote 16. \nSecuritization Activities\n \nThe firm securitizes residential and commercial mortgages, corporate bonds, loans and other types of financial assets by selling these assets to securitization vehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and limited liability companies) or through a resecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter of the beneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm’s residential mortgage securitizations are primarily in connection with government agency securitizations. \nThe firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has relinquished control over the transferred financial assets. Prior to securitization, the firm generally accounts for assets pending transfer at fair value and therefore does not typically recognize significant gains or losses upon the transfer of assets. Net revenues from underwriting activities are recognized in connection with the sales of the underlying beneficial interests to investors.\nThe firm generally receives cash in exchange for the transferred assets but may also have continuing involvement with the transferred financial assets, including ownership of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, primarily in the form of debt instruments. The firm may also purchase senior or subordinated securities issued by securitization vehicles (which are typically VIEs) in connection with secondary market-making activities. \nThe primary risks included in beneficial interests and other interests from the firm’s continuing involvement with securitization vehicles are the performance of the underlying collateral, the position of the firm’s investment in the capital structure of the securitization vehicle and the market yield for the security. Interests accounted for at fair value are primarily classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Interests not accounted for at fair value are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements.\n \nThe table below presents the amount of financial assets securitized and the cash flows received on retained interests in securitization entities in which the firm had continuing involvement as of the end of the period. \nYear Ended December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nResidential mortgages\n$\n33,210\n \n$\n20,276\n \n$\n26,717\n \nCommercial mortgages\n7,238\n \n4,446\n \n13,935\n \nOther financial assets\n2,782\n \n5,951\n \n3,617\n \nTotal financial assets securitized\n$\n43,230\n \n$\n30,673\n \n$\n44,269\n \nRetained interests cash flows\n$\n722\n \n$\n493\n \n$\n551\n \nThe firm securitized assets of $\n364\n million during 2024, $\n369\n million during 2023 and $\n792\n million during 2022, in a non-cash exchange for loans and investments. \nThe table below presents information about nonconsolidated securitization entities to which the firm sold assets and had continuing involvement as of the end of the period. \n$ in millions\nOutstanding\n Principal\n Amount\nRetained\n Interests\nPurchased\n Interests\nAs of December 2024\nU.S. government agency-issued CMOs\n$\n34,049\n \n$\n3,053\n \n$\n–\n \nOther residential mortgage-backed\n33,069\n \n1,357\n \n14\n \nOther commercial mortgage-backed\n59,562\n \n945\n \n57\n \nCorporate debt and other asset-backed\n12,059\n \n493\n \n5\n \nTotal\n$\n138,739\n \n$\n5,848\n \n$\n76\n \nAs of December 2023\nU.S. government agency-issued CMOs\n$\n31,140\n \n$\n2,260\n \n$\n–\n \nOther residential mortgage-backed\n28,767\n \n1,162\n \n78\n \nOther commercial mortgage-backed\n61,648\n \n1,192\n \n61\n \nCorporate debt and other asset-backed\n12,501\n \n685\n \n56\n \nTotal\n$\n134,056\n \n$\n5,299\n \n$\n195\n \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n193\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The carrying value of these derivatives and commitments was a net asset of $\n847\n million as of December 2024 and $\n120\n million as of December 2023, and the notional amount of these derivatives and commitments was $\n2.78\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n1.95\n billion as of December 2023. The notional amounts of these derivatives and commitments are included in maximum exposure to loss in the nonconsolidated VIE table in Note 17. Additionally, the firm provided seller financing of $\n2.12\n billion in connection with the sale of $\n4.44\n billion of loans (the vast majority of which were related to GreenSky) during 2024 and of approximately $\n2.7\n billion in connection with the sale of $\n3.24\n billion of Marcus loans during 2023. The principal and interest repayments received from these financings were $\n2.85\n billion for 2024 and were $\n1.0\n billion for 2023. Seller financing related to the GreenSky loans sale was fully repaid as of December 2024.

In practice, simultaneous changes in assumptions might magnify or counteract the sensitivities disclosed above. \n•\nThe constant prepayment rate is included only for positions for which it is a key assumption in the determination of fair value. \n•\nThe discount rate for retained interests that relate to U.S. government agency-issued CMOs does not include any credit loss. Expected credit loss assumptions are reflected in the discount rate for the remainder of retained interests.\n \nThe firm has other retained interests not reflected in the table above with a fair value of $\n491\n million and a weighted average life of \n5.0\n years as of December 2024, and a fair value of $\n674\n million and a weighted average life of \n5.0\n years as of December 2023. Due to the nature and fair value of certain of these retained interests, the weighted average assumptions for constant prepayment and discount rates and the related sensitivity to adverse changes are not meaningful as of both December 2024 and December 2023. The firm’s maximum exposure to adverse changes in the value of these interests is the carrying value of $\n493\n million as of December 2024 and $\n685\n million as of December 2023.\n \n194\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 17. \nVariable Interest Entities \nA variable interest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt or equity) or other interest (e.g., derivatives or loans and lending commitments) that will absorb portions of the VIE’s expected losses and/or receive portions of the VIE’s expected residual returns. \nThe firm’s variable interests in VIEs include senior and subordinated debt; loans and lending commitments; limited and general partnership interests; preferred and common equity; derivatives that may include foreign currency, equity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the fees the firm receives from investment funds. Certain interest rate, foreign currency and credit derivatives the firm enters into with VIEs are not variable interests because they create, rather than absorb, risk. \nVIEs generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are either collateralized by or indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The debt and equity securities issued by a VIE may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. The firm’s involvement with VIEs includes securitization of financial assets, as described in Note 16, and investments in and loans to other types of VIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the firm’s consolidation policies, including the definition of a VIE. \nVIE Consolidation Analysis\n \nThe enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis that principally considers: \n•\nWhich variable interest holder has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; \n•\nWhich variable interest holder has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE; \n•\nThe VIE’s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders; \n•\nThe VIE’s capital structure; \n•\nThe terms between the VIE and its variable interest holders and other parties involved with the VIE; and \n•\nRelated-party relationships. \nThe firm reassesses its evaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when certain reconsideration events occur. The firm reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current facts and circumstances.\nVIE Activities \nThe firm is principally involved with VIEs through the following business activities: \nMortgage-Backed VIEs.\n The firm sells residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assets sold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps, which are typically not variable interests. The firm generally enters into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk. \nTax Credit and Other Investing VIEs\n. The firm makes equity investments in VIEs that invest in qualified affordable housing and renewable energy projects designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and related tax benefits. The firm also purchases equity and debt securities issued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold real estate, performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans and equity securities. In addition, the firm makes equity investments in certain investment fund VIEs it manages and is entitled to receive fees from these VIEs. The firm generally does not sell assets to, or enter into derivatives with, these VIEs. \nCorporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs.\n The firm structures VIEs that issue notes to clients, purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities, and makes loans to VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain of these VIEs synthetically create the exposure for the beneficial interests they issue by entering into credit derivatives with the firm, rather than purchasing the underlying assets. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives, such as total return swaps, with certain corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays the VIE a return due to the beneficial interest holders and receives the return on the collateral owned by the VIE. The collateral owned by these VIEs is primarily other asset-backed loans and securities. The firm may be removed as the total return swap counterparty and may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk related to these swaps. The firm may sell assets to the corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs it structures. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n195\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPrincipal-Protected Note VIEs.\n The firm structures VIEs that issue principal-protected notes to clients. These VIEs own portfolios of assets, principally with exposure to hedge funds. Substantially all of the principal protection on the notes issued by these VIEs is provided by the asset portfolio rebalancing that is required under the terms of the notes. The firm enters into total return swaps with these VIEs under which the firm pays the VIE the return due to the principal-protected note holders and receives the return on the assets owned by the VIE. The firm may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nTax Credit VIEs\nThe firm makes equity investments in nonconsolidated tax credit VIEs that invest in qualified affordable housing and renewable energy projects. These VIEs are generally organized as limited partnerships or similar entities and a third-party is typically the general partner or the managing member. The firm invests in the entity as a limited partner and receives income tax credits and other income tax benefits for such investments. In connection with the adoption of ASU No. 2023-02, as of January 1, 2024, the firm elected the proportional amortization method for qualified affordable housing and renewable energy projects that receive production tax credits. The investments that meet the criteria for the proportional amortization method of accounting are amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received on such investments. The amortization of investments and the related income tax credits and other income tax benefits are recorded as a component of the \nprovision for taxes\n, and are included in \nother operating activities\n in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe table below presents information about investments (included in miscellaneous receivables and other within \nother assets\n in the consolidated balance sheets) in qualified affordable housing and renewable energy projects that met the criteria of the proportional amortization method of accounting. \n \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nCarrying value of investments\n$\n3,456\n \n$\n3,394\n \nIn the table above, investments included $\n2.15\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n2.26\n billion as of December 2023 of accrued unfunded commitments.

The carrying value of lending commitments was a liability of $\n929\n million (including allowance for credit losses of $\n674\n million) as of December 2024 and $\n845\n million (including allowance for credit losses of $\n620\n million) as of December 2023. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments was a liability of $\n4.84\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n5.29\n billion as of December 2023. Had these lending commitments been carried at fair value and included in the fair value hierarchy, $\n2.44\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n3.10\n billion as of December 2023 would have been classified in level 2, and $\n2.40\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n2.19\n billion as of December 2023 would have been classified in level 3. \n•\nHeld for sale lending commitments are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. The carrying value of lending commitments held for sale was a liability of $\n43\n million as of December 2024 and $\n70\n million as of December 2023. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments approximates the carrying value. Had these lending commitments been included in the fair value hierarchy, they would have been primarily classified in level 3 as of both December 2024 and December 2023. \n•\nGains or losses related to lending commitments at fair value, if any, are generally recorded net of any fees in other principal transactions.\n \nCommercial Lending. \nThe firm’s commercial lending commitments were primarily extended to investment-grade corporate borrowers.\n Such commitments primarily included $\n148.78\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n137.11\n billion as of December 2023, related to relationship lending activities (principally used for operating and general corporate purposes), and $\n11.26\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n4.21\n billion as of December 2023, related to other investment banking activities (generally extended for contingent acquisition financing and are often intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources). \nThe firm also extends lending commitments in connection with other types of corporate lending, commercial real estate financing and other collateralized lending.\n See Note 9 for further information about funded loans. \nTo mitigate the credit risk associated with the firm’s commercial lending activities, the firm obtains credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and index-based contracts. \nWarehouse Financing.\n The firm provides financing to clients who warehouse financial assets. These arrangements are collateralized by the warehoused assets, primarily consisting of residential real estate, consumer and corporate loans. \nConsumer. \nThe firm’s consumer lending commitments includes: \n•\nCredit card lines issued by the firm to consumers were $\n78.10\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n70.82\n billion as of December 2023. Such credit card lines included $\n14.32\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n14.35\n billion as of December 2023 of commitments classified as held for sale in connection with the planned sale of the GM co-branded credit card portfolio. These credit card lines are cancellable by the firm. \n•\nCommitments to provide unsecured installment loans to consumers were $\n2.25\n billion as of December 2023 and such commitments were classified as held for sale in connection with the sale of GreenSky. During 2024, the firm completed the sale of GreenSky. \nRisk Participations \nThe firm also risk participates certain of its commercial lending commitments to other financial institutions. In the event of a risk participant’s default, the firm will be responsible to fund the borrower. \nCollateralized Agreement Commitments/ Collateralized Financing Commitments \nCollateralized agreement commitments includes forward starting resale and securities borrowing agreements, and collateralized financing commitments includes forward starting repurchase and secured lending agreements that settle at a future date. Collateralized agreement commitments also includes transactions where the firm has entered into commitments to provide contingent financing to its clients and counterparties through resale agreements. The firm’s funding of these commitments depends on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to the resale agreement and these commitments can expire unused.\n \nInvestment Commitments \nInvestment commitments includes commitments to invest in private equity, real estate and other assets directly and through funds that the firm raises and manages. Investment commitments included $\n1.10\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n963\n million as of December 2023, related to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm. If these commitments are called, they would be funded at market value on the date of investment. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n199\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

See the tables in “Commitments” above for a summary of the firm’s commitments. \n•\nThe carrying value for derivatives included derivative assets of $\n464\n million as of December 2024 and $\n359\n million as of December 2023, and derivative liabilities of $\n4.00\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n5.60\n billion as of December 2023.\n \nDerivative Guarantees.\n The firm enters into various derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including written equity and commodity put options, written currency contracts and interest rate caps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives are risk managed together with derivatives that do not meet the definition of a guarantee, and therefore the amounts in the table above do not reflect the firm’s overall risk related to derivative activities. Disclosures about derivatives are not required if they may be cash settled and the firm has no basis to conclude it is probable that the counterparties held the underlying instruments at the inception of the contract. The firm has concluded that these conditions have been met for certain large, internationally active commercial and investment bank counterparties, central clearing counterparties, hedge funds and certain other counterparties. Accordingly, the firm has not included such contracts in the table above. See Note 7 for information about credit derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee, which are not included in the table above. \nDerivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the carrying value is considered the best indication of payment/performance risk for individual contracts. However, the carrying values in the table above exclude the effect of counterparty and cash collateral netting.\n \nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees\n. Securities lending and clearing guarantees include the indemnifications and guarantees that the firm provides in its capacity as an agency lender and in its capacity as a sponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. \nAs an agency lender, the firm indemnifies most of its securities lending customers against losses incurred in the event that borrowers do not return securities and the collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the securities borrowed.\n The maximum payout of such indemnifications was $\n10.62\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n14.19\n billion as of December 2023. Collateral held by the lenders in connection with securities lending indemnifications was $\n11.02 billion\n as of December 2024 and $\n14.63 billion\n as of December 2023. Because the contractual nature of these arrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with a market value that exceeds the value of the securities lent to the borrower, there is minimal performance risk associated with these indemnifications. \n200\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the performance of its sponsored member clients to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in connection with certain resale and repurchase agreements. To minimize potential losses on such guarantees, the firm obtains a security interest in the collateral that the sponsored client placed with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on such guarantees is minimal. The maximum payout on this guarantee was $\n47.44\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n14.60\n billion as of December 2023. The related collateral held was $\n46.96 billion\n as of December 2024 and $\n14.69 billion\n as of December 2023. \nOther Financial Guarantees\n. In the ordinary course of business, the firm provides other financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of credit and other guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions and fund-related guarantees). These guarantees represent obligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that beneficiary.\n Other financial guarantees also include a guarantee that the firm has provided to the Government of Malaysia that it will receive, by August 2025, at least $\n1.4\n billion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In connection with this guarantee, the firm agreed to make a one-time interim payment of $\n250\n million towards the $\n1.4\n billion if the Government of Malaysia did not receive at least $\n500\n million in assets and proceeds by August 2022. The firm does not believe that any interim payment is required. Any amounts paid by the firm would, in any event, be subject to reimbursement in the event the assets and proceeds received by the Government of Malaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $\n1.4\n billion. \nOn October 11, 2023, the firm filed a demand for arbitration alleging that the Government of Malaysia had, as of August 2022, recovered assets and proceeds well in excess of $\n500\n million; it had recovered substantial additional assets and proceeds that should be credited against the guarantee; and it had not used all reasonable efforts to recover other assets and proceeds that cou\nld be credited against the guarantee. On November 8, 2023, the Government of Malaysia filed a response to the firm’s demand for arbitration and on June 10, 2024, filed an application for a partial award to immediately enforce the interim payment (plus interest). On July 24, 2024, the arbitral tribunal rejected that application. Final determinations on all remaining issues, including any subsequent enforcement of the interim payment, are to be made at a final hearing. The arbitral process is ongoing. See\n Note 27 for further information about matters related to 1MDB.\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts.\n The firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital I, Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III (the Trusts), and other entities, for the limited purpose of issuing securities to third parties, lending the proceeds to the firm and entering into contractual arrangements with the firm and third parties related to this purpose. The firm does not consolidate these entities. See Notes 14 and 19 for further information about the transactions involving the Trusts. \nThe firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of the securities issued by these entities. Timely payment by the firm of amounts due to these entities under the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments due on the securities issued by these entities. No subsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the securities of the Trusts. \nManagement believes that it is unlikely that any circumstances will occur, such as nonperformance on the part of paying agents or other service providers, that would make it necessary for the firm to make payments related to these entities other than those required under the terms of the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements and in connection with certain expenses incurred by these entities. \nIndemnities and Guarantees of Service Providers.\n In the ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the firm or its affiliates. \nThe firm may also be liable to some clients or other parties for losses arising from its custodial role or caused by acts or omissions of third-party service providers, including sub-custodians and third-party brokers. In certain cases, the firm has the right to seek indemnification from these third-party service providers for certain relevant losses incurred by the firm. In addition, the firm is a member of payment, clearing and settlement networks, as well as securities exchanges around the world that may require the firm to meet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in the event of member defaults and other loss scenarios. \nIn connection with the firm’s prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle transactions entered into by clients with other brokerage firms. The firm’s obligations in respect of such transactions are secured by the assets in the client’s account and proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the client. In connection with joint venture investments, the firm may issue loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the event of fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities and other matters involving the borrower. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n201\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications as this depends upon the occurrence of future events, including an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2024 and December 2023. \nOther Representations, Warranties and Indemnifications.\n The firm provides representations and warranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and warranties. The firm may also provide indemnifications protecting against changes in or adverse application of certain U.S. tax laws in connection with ordinary-course transactions, such as securities issuances, borrowings or derivatives. \nIn addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in or an adverse application of certain non-U.S. tax laws. These indemnifications, as well as indemnifications provided by the firm on other contractual or other obligations, generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. Future changes in tax laws and how such laws would apply to these indemnifications cannot be determined. Therefore, the firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2024 and December 2023. \nGuarantees of Subsidiaries.\n Group Inc. is the entity that fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by GS Finance Corp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie, subject to certain exceptions. Group Inc. also guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated with counterparties. In addition, Group Inc. has provided guarantees to Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and GSBE related to agreements that each entity has entered into with certain of its counterparties. Given the obligations of the consolidated subsidiaries are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets or reflected as commitments, Group Inc.’s liabilities as guarantor are not separately disclosed.\n \nNote 19. \nShareholders’ Equity \nCommon Equity\n \nAs of both December 2024 and December 2023, the firm had \n4.00\n billion authorized shares of common stock and \n200\n million authorized shares of nonvoting common stock, each with a par value of $\n0.01\n per share. \nThe firm’s share repurchase program is intended to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 20.\n \nRegulation and Capital Adequacy \nThe FRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a bank holding company under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under amendments to this Act. The firm is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). \nThe capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital and leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets and off-balance sheet exposures. Failure to comply with these capital requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the firm’s regulators and could limit the firm’s ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. The firm’s capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, certain of the firm’s subsidiaries are subject to separate regulations and capital requirements. \nCapital Framework \nThe regulations under the Capital Framework are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III) and also implement certain provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Under the Capital Framework, the firm is an “Advanced approaches” banking organization and has been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements. The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. \nThe firm calculates its CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Each of the ratios calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules must meet its respective capital requirements. \nUnder the Capital Framework, the firm is also subject to leverage requirements which consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer. \nConsolidated Regulatory Capital Requirements \nRisk-Based Capital Ratios. \nThe table below presents the risk-based capital requirements. \n \nStandardized\nAdvanced\nAs of December 2024\nCET1 capital ratio\n13.7\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\nTier 1 capital ratio\n15.2\n \n%\n11.5\n \n%\nTotal capital ratio\n17.2\n \n%\n13.5\n \n%\nAs of December 2023\nCET1 capital ratio\n13.0\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\nTier 1 capital ratio\n14.5\n \n%\n11.5\n \n%\nTotal capital ratio\n16.5\n \n%\n13.5\n \n%\nIn the table above: \n•\nAs of both December 2024 and December 2023, under both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules, the CET1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of \n4.5\n%, the Tier 1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of \n6.0\n% and the Total capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of \n8.0\n%. These requirements also include the capital conservation buffer requirements, consisting of the G-SIB surcharge (Method 2) of \n3.0\n% and the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to \nzero percent\n. In addition, the capital conservation buffer requirements include the stress capital buffer (SCB) of \n6.2\n% as of December 2024 and \n5.5\n% as of December 2023 under the Standardized Capital Rules and a buffer of \n2.5\n% as of both December 2024 and December 2023 under the Advanced Capital Rules. \n•\nThe G-SIB surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year and is generally applicable for the following year. The G-SIB surcharge is calculated using two methodologies, the higher of which is reflected in the firm’s risk-based capital requirements. The first calculation (Method 1) is based on the Basel Committee’s methodology which, among other factors, relies upon measures of the size, activity and complexity of each G-SIB. The second calculation (Method 2) uses similar inp\nuts but includes a measure of reliance on short-term wholesale funding.\n \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n205\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The exposure measures for derivatives and securities financing transactions are based on specific formulas which take certain factors into consideration. \n•\nUnder the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm computes risk-weights for wholesale and retail credit exposures in accordance with the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The exposure measures for derivatives and securities financing transactions are computed utilizing internal models. \n•\nFor both Standardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the risk-weights for securitizations and equities are based on specific required formulaic approaches. \nMarket Risk\n \nRWAs for market risk in accordance with the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules are generally consistent. Market RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure which include the following: \n•\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level.\nFor both risk management purposes and regulatory capital calculations, the firm uses a single VaR model which captures risks, including those related to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. However, VaR used for risk management purposes differs from VaR used for regulatory capital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to differences in time horizons, confidence levels and the scope of positions on which VaR is calculated. For risk management purposes, a \n95\n% \none-day\n VaR is used, whereas for regulatory capital requirements, a \n99\n% \n10-day\n VaR is used to determine Market RWAs and a \n99\n% \none-day\n VaR is used to determine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the daily net revenues used to determine risk management VaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the VaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business day) include intraday activity, whereas the Capital Framework requires that intraday activity be excluded from daily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. As a result, there may be differences in the number of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily net revenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to the amounts calculated for risk management VaR. \nThe firm’s positional losses observed on a single day exceeded its \n99\n% \none-day\n regulatory VaR on two occasions during 2024 and on one occasion during 2023. There was no change in the firm’s VaR multiplier used to calculate Market RWAs; \n•\nStressed VaR is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, during a period of significant market stress; \n•\nIncremental risk is the potential loss in value of non-securitized positions due to the default or credit migration of issuers of financial instruments over a one-year time horizon; \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n207\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n•\nComprehensive risk is the potential loss in value, due to price risk and defaults, within the firm’s credit correlation positions; and \n•\nSpecific risk is the risk of loss on a position that could result from factors other than broad market movements, including event risk, default risk and idiosyncratic risk. The standardized measurement method is used to determine specific risk RWAs, by applying supervisory defined risk-weighting factors after applicable netting is performed. \nOperational Risk\n \nOperational RWAs are only required to be included under the Advanced Capital Rules.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGS Bank USA\n \nGS Bank USA is the firm’s primary U.S. bank subsidiary. GS Bank USA is a New York State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and is subject to regulatory capital requirements that are calculated under the Capital Framework. GS Bank USA is an “Advanced approaches” banking organization under the Capital Framework. The deposits of GS Bank USA are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. \nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements (consisting of a \n2.5\n% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer). The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as CET1 capital. In addition, the Capital Framework includes the leverage ratio requirement. GS Bank USA is required to calculate the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. The lower of each risk-based capital ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules is the ratio against which GS Bank USA’s compliance with its risk-based capital requirements is assessed. In addition, under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action applicable to GS Bank USA, in order to meet the quantitative requirements for a “well-capitalized” depository institution, GS Bank USA must also meet the “well-capitalized” requirements in the table below. GS Bank USA’s capital levels and prompt corrective action classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Failure to comply with the capital requirements, including a breach of the buffers described below, would result in restrictions being imposed by the regulators. \nThe table below presents GS Bank USA’s risk-based capital, leverage and “well-capitalized” requirements. \nAs of December\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n\"Well-capitalized\"\nRequirements\nRequirements\nRisk-based capital requirements\n \nCET1 capital ratio\n7.0\n \n%\n7.0\n \n%\n6.5\n \n%\n6.5\n \n%\nTier 1 capital ratio\n8.5\n \n%\n8.5\n \n%\n8.0\n \n%\n8.0\n \n%\nTotal capital ratio\n10.5\n \n%\n10.5\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\nLeverage requirements\n \nTier 1 leverage ratio\n4.0\n \n%\n4.0\n \n%\n5.0\n \n%\n5.0\n \n%\nSLR\n3.0\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\n6.0\n \n%\n6.0\n \n%\nIn the table above: \n•\nThe CET1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of \n4.5\n%, the Tier 1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of \n6.0\n% and the Total capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of \n8.0\n%.

For example, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test.  \nIn addition, subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax and legal guidelines, rating agency requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk. \nGroup Inc.’s equity investment in subsidiaries was $\n140.79\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n133.75\n billion as of December 2023, of which Group Inc. was required to maintain $\n98.48\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n95.80\n billion as of December 2023, of minimum equity capital in its regulated subsidiaries in order to satisfy the regulatory requirements of such subsidiaries. \nGroup Inc.’s capital invested in certain non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries is exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is managed through a combination of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt and derivatives.

Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the dilutive effect of the common stock deliverable for RSUs for which the delivery of the underlying common stock is subject to satisfaction of future service, performance or market conditions.\n \nThe table below presents information about basic and diluted EPS. \nYear Ended December\nin millions, except per share amounts\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet earnings to common\n$\n13,525\n \n$\n7,907\n \n$\n10,764\n \nWeighted average basic shares\n328.1\n340.8\n352.1\nEffect of dilutive RSUs\n5.5\n5.0\n6.0\nWeighted average diluted shares\n333.6\n345.8\n358.1\nBasic EPS\n$\n41.07\n \n$\n23.05\n \n$\n30.42\n \nDiluted EPS\n$\n40.54\n \n$\n22.87\n \n$\n30.06\n \nIn the table above: \n•\nNet earnings to common represents net earnings applicable to common shareholders, which is calculated as net earnings less preferred stock dividends. \n•\nUnvested share-based awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are treated as a separate class of securities under the two-class method. Distributed earnings allocated to these securities reduce net earnings to common to calculate EPS under this method. The impact of applying this methodology was a reduction in basic EPS of $\n0.15\n for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n•\nDiluted EPS does not include antidilutive RSUs, including those that are subject to market or performance conditions, of \n0.1\n million for 2024, \n0.4\n million for 2023 and \n0.5\n million for 2022.\n \nNote 22.\n \nTransactions with Affiliated Funds\n \nThe firm has formed nonconsolidated investment funds with third-party investors.

These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized and primarily relate to the ability to utilize losses and tax credits in various tax jurisdictions.

The firm also recorded a valuation allowance of $\n328\n million as of December 2024 and $\n396\n million as of December 2023, related to these net operating loss carryforwards.  \nAs of December 2024, the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward was $\n1.3\n billion, the state and local net operating loss carryforward was $\n3.3\n billion, and the foreign net operating loss carryforward was $\n1.5\n billion. If not utilized, the U.S. federal, the state and local, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. If these carryforwards expire, they will not have a material impact on the firm’s results of operations. As of December 2024, the firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $\n405\n million in connection with foreign tax credit carryforwards and a related valuation allowance of $\n289\n million. As of December 2024, the firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $\n45\n million in connection with general business credit carryforwards and $\n11\n million in connection with state and local tax credit carryforwards. If not utilized, the foreign tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2033, the general business credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2025 and the state and local tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2026.\nAs of both December 2024 and December 2023, the firm had no U.S. federal capital loss carryforwards and no related net deferred income tax assets. \nAs of December 2024, the firm had deferred tax assets of\n $\n7\n million \nin connection with state and local capital loss carryforwards and a valuation allowance of $\n1\n million related to these capital loss carryforwards.\n As of December 2024, the firm had deferred tax assets of $\n365\n million in connection with foreign capital loss carryforwards and a valuation allowance of $\n346\n million related to these capital loss carryforwards. \nThe valuation allowance increased by $\n86\n million during 2024 and $\n409\n million during 2023. The increases in both 2024 and 2023 were primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets from which the firm does not expect to realize any benefit. \nThe firm permanently reinvested eligible earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. As of both December 2024 and December 2023, all U.S. taxes were accrued on these subsidiaries’ distributable earnings. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n213\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits \nThe firm recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. \nThe accrued liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and income tax penalties was $\n475\n million as of December 2024 and $\n320\n million as of December 2023. The firm recognized interest expense and income tax penalties of $\n113\n million for 2024, $\n90\n million for 2023 and $\n59\n million for 2022. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly during the twelve months subsequent to December 2024 due to potential audit settlements. However, at this time it is not possible to estimate any potential change.\nThe table below presents the changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in other liabilities.\nYear Ended or as of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n1,726\n \n$\n1,533\n \n$\n1,446\n \nIncreases based on current year tax positions\n381\n \n143\n \n190\n \nIncreases based on prior years' tax positions\n87\n \n164\n \n10\n \nDecreases based on prior years' tax positions\n(\n23\n)\n(\n92\n)\n(\n32\n)\nDecreases related to settlements\n(\n9\n)\n(\n20\n)\n(\n76\n)\nExchange rate fluctuations\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n5\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n2,162\n \n$\n1,726\n \n$\n1,533\n \nIn the table above, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits included $\n1.8\n billion as of December 2024, $\n1.4\n billion as of December 2023 and $\n1.2\n billion as of December 2022 of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits in the table above would not affect the annual tax rate, as such benefits have jurisdictional offsets or relate to temporary differences.\nRegulatory Tax Examinations \nThe firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where the firm has significant business operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The firm does not expect completion of these audits to have a material impact on the firm’s financial condition, but it may be material to operating results for a particular period, depending, in part, on the operating results for that period.\n \nThe table below presents the earliest tax years that remain subject to examination by major jurisdiction. \nAs of\nJurisdiction\nDecember 2024\nU.S. Federal\n2011\nNew York State and City\n2015\nUnited Kingdom\n2017\nJapan\n2018\nHong Kong\n2018\nThe firm has been accepted into the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) program by the IRS for each of the tax years from 2013 through 2025. This program allows the firm to work with the IRS to identify and resolve potential U.S. Federal tax issues before the filing of tax returns. All issues addressed through the CAP program for the 2011 through 2018 tax years have been resolved and completion is pending final review by the Joint Committee on Taxation. All issues for the 2019 through 2022 tax years have been resolved and will be effectively settled pending administrative completion by the IRS. Final completion of tax years 2011 through 2022 will not have a material impact on the effective tax rate. The 2023 tax year remains subject to post-filing review. New York State and City examinations of tax years 2015 through 2018 commenced during 2021.\nAll years, including and subsequent to the years in the table above, remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. The firm believes that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits it has established is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments.\n214\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 25. \nBusiness Segments \nThe firm manages and reports its activities in \nthree\n business segments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. These business segments are determined and organized based on products and services provided, and the types of customers and counterparties served. See Note 1 for a description of the firm’s business segments. \nThe firm’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) is its president and chief operating officer. The CODM makes operating decisions, assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, the firm’s operating segments principally based on the total net revenues of the segments, revenues net of provision for credit losses, total operating expenses, pre-tax earnings, net earnings applicable to common shareholders and the return on average common equity to assess the performance of the segments. The CODM evaluates segment operating performance against the firm’s targets and industry metrics and considers the current and future business and operating environment.\nThe accounting policies used to prepare the operating results and other metrics for the segments are consistent with those described in Note 3. The following provides a description of the primary components of the firm’s segment results disclosed in the table below.\n•\nThe firm fully allocates its revenues, expenses, assets and shareholders’ equity to the firm’s \nthree\n business segments.\n•\nRevenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining pre-tax earnings for the respective segment.  \n•\nNet revenues in the firm’s segments include allocations of interest income and expense based on the funding generated by, or the funding and liquidity requirements of the respective segments. Net interest is included in segment net revenues as it is consistent with how management assesses segment performance. \n•\nExpenses not directly associated with specific segments are allocated among the business segments based on an estimate of support provided to each segment. \n•\nCompensation and benefits expenses in the firm’s segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of the firm’s business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm’s other business segments.\n•\nCertain assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, and secured client financing), not directly associated with specific segments are generally allocated among the business segments based on the funding and liquidity requirements of the segments. \n•\nCommon shareholders’ equity and preferred stock dividends are allocated to each segment based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements. \n•\nNet earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment’s pre-tax earnings. \n•\nManagement believes that this allocation provides a reasonable representation of each segment’s contribution to consolidated net earnings to common, return on average common equity and total assets.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGeographic Information \nDue to the highly integrated nature of international financial markets, the firm manages its businesses based on the profitability of the enterprise as a whole. The methodology for allocating profitability to geographic regions is dependent on estimates and management judgment because a significant portion of the firm’s activities require cross-border coordination in order to facilitate the needs of the firm’s clients. Geographic results are generally allocated as follows: \n•\nGlobal Banking & Markets: Investment banking fees and Other: location of the client and investment banking team; FICC intermediation and Equities intermediation: location of the market-making desk; FICC financing and Equities financing: location of the desk. \n•\nAsset & Wealth Management (excluding direct-to-consumer business, Equity investments and Debt investments): location of the sales team; Direct-to-consumer business: location of the client; Equity investments and Debt investments: location of the investment or investment professional. \n•\nPlatform Solutions: location of the client.\n \nThe table below presents total net revenues, pre-tax earnings and net earnings by geographic region. \n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nYear Ended December\nAmericas\n$\n34,448\n \n64\n \n%\n$\n29,335\n \n64\n \n%\n$\n28,669\n \n61\n \n%\nEMEA\n12,250\n \n23\n \n%\n11,744\n \n25\n \n%\n12,860\n \n27\n \n%\nAsia\n6,814\n \n13\n \n%\n5,175\n \n11\n \n%\n5,836\n \n12\n \n%\nTotal net revenues\n$\n53,512\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n46,254\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n47,365\n \n100\n \n%\nAmericas\n$\n12,106\n \n66\n \n%\n$\n6,038\n \n56\n \n%\n$\n7,016\n \n52\n \n%\nEMEA\n4,418\n \n24\n \n%\n4,033\n \n38\n \n%\n5,260\n \n39\n \n%\nAsia\n1,873\n \n10\n \n%\n668\n \n6\n \n%\n1,210\n \n9\n \n%\nTotal pre-tax earnings\n$\n18,397\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n10,739\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n13,486\n \n100\n \n%\nAmericas\n$\n9,354\n \n66\n \n%\n$\n4,849\n \n57\n \n%\n$\n6,067\n \n54\n \n%\nEMEA\n3,470\n \n24\n \n%\n3,137\n \n37\n \n%\n4,164\n \n37\n \n%\nAsia\n1,452\n \n10\n \n%\n530\n \n6\n \n%\n1,030\n \n9\n \n%\nTotal net earnings\n$\n14,276\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n8,516\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n11,261\n \n100\n \n%\nIn the table above: \n•\nAmericas pre-tax earnings for 2023 were impacted by impairments related to commercial real estate in CIEs, the write-down related to GreenSky, an impairment of goodwill related to Consumer platforms and the FDIC special assessment fee.\n•\nSubstantially all of the amounts in the Americas were attributable to the U.S. \n•\nAsia includes Australia and New Zealand.\n \nNote 26. \nCredit Concentrations\n \nThe firm’s concentrations of credit risk arise from its market-making, client facilitation, investing, underwriting, lending and collateralized transactions, and cash management activities, and may be impacted by changes in economic, industry or political factors. These activities expose the firm to many different industries and counterparties, and may also subject the firm to a concentration of credit risk to a particular central bank, counterparty, borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, or to a particular clearinghouse or exchange. The firm seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring exposures and obtaining collateral from counterparties as deemed appropriate. \nThe firm measures and monitors its credit exposure based on amounts owed to the firm after taking into account risk mitigants that the firm considers when determining credit risk. Such risk mitigants include netting and collateral arrangements and economic hedges, such as credit derivatives, futures and forward contracts. Netting and collateral agreements permit the firm to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and/or enable the firm to obtain collateral on an upfront or contingent basis.\n \nThe table below presents the credit concentrations included in trading cash instruments and investments. \n \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nU.S. government and agency obligations\n$\n389,148\n \n$\n260,531\n \nPercentage of total assets\n23.2\n \n%\n15.9\n \n%\nNon-U.S. government and agency obligations\n$\n74,496\n \n$\n90,681\n \nPercentage of total assets\n4.4\n \n%\n5.5\n \n%\n \nIn addition, the firm had $\n151.84\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n206.07\n billion as of December 2023 of cash deposits held at central banks (included in cash and cash equivalents),\n \nof which $\n105.78\n billion as of December 2024 and $\n105.66\n billion as of December 2023 was held at the Federal Reserve. \nAs of both December 2024 and December 2023, the firm did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded \n2\n% of total assets.\nCollateral obtained by the firm related to derivative assets is principally cash and is held by the firm or a third-party custodian. Collateral obtained by the firm related to resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions is primarily U.S. government and agency obligations, and non-U.S. government and agency obligations. See Note 11 for further information about collateralized agreements and financings. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n217\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents U.S. government and agency obligations, and non-U.S. government and agency obligations that collateralize resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions. \n \nAs of December\n$ in millions\n2024\n2023\nU.S. government and agency obligations\n$\n129,942\n \n$\n154,056\n \nNon-U.S. government and agency obligations\n$\n76,932\n \n$\n92,833\n \nIn the table above: \n•\nNon-U.S. government and agency obligations primarily consists of securities issued by the governments of the U.K., Japan, Germany and France.\n•\nGiven that the firm’s primary credit exposure on such transactions is to the counterparty to the transaction, the firm would be exposed to the collateral issuer only in the event of counterparty default.\n \nNote 27. \nLegal Proceedings \nThe firm is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of the firm’s businesses. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages. \nUnder ASC 450, an event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” and an event is “remote” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.” Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the firm is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the firm believes the risk of loss is more than slight.\nWith respect to matters described below for which management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an amount of money damages, (ii) the firm is being, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers in a securities offering and is not being indemnified by a party that the firm believes will pay the full amount of any judgment, or (iii) the purchasers are demanding that the firm repurchase securities, management has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss based on (a) in the case of (i), the amount of money damages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the difference between the initial sales price of the securities that the firm sold in such offering and the estimated lowest subsequent price of such securities prior to the action being commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), the price that purchasers paid for the securities less the estimated value, if any, as of December 2024 of the relevant securities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into account any other factors believed to be relevant to the particular matter or matters of that type. As of the date hereof, the firm has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for such matters and for any other matters described below where management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible aggregate loss to be approximately $\n1.7\n billion in excess of the aggregate reserves for such matters. \nManagement is generally unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters other than those included in the estimate above, including where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of money damages, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (ii) matters are in early stages, (iii) matters relate to regulatory investigations or reviews, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (vi) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (vii) there are novel legal issues presented. For example, the firm’s potential liabilities with respect to the investigations and reviews described below in “Regulatory Investigations and Reviews and Related Litigation” generally are not included in management’s estimate of reasonably possible loss. However, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of such other matters will have a material adverse effect on the firm’s financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the firm’s operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.\n \n218\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1MDB-Related Matters \nBetween 2012 and 2013, subsidiaries of the firm acted as arrangers or purchasers of approximately $\n6.5\n billion of debt securities of 1MDB. \nOn November 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a criminal information and guilty plea by Tim Leissner, a former participating managing director of the firm, and an indictment against Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing director of the firm. On August 28, 2018, Leissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York of conspiring to launder money and to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act’s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. Ng was charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions, and on April 8, 2022, Ng was found guilty on all counts following a trial. \nOn August 18, 2020, the firm announced that it entered into a settlement agreement with the Government of Malaysia to resolve the criminal and regulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving the firm, which includes a guarantee that the Government of Malaysia receives at least $\n1.4\n billion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further information about this guarantee, including related arbitration proceedings. \nOn October 22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached settlements of governmental and regulatory investigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Singapore Attorney General’s Chambers, the Singapore Commercial Affairs Department, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. Group Inc. entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a charge against the firm, one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and was later dismissed on May 6, 2024 in accordance with the agreement. In addition, GS Malaysia pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was sentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor granted the firm a five-year exemption to maintain its status as a qualified professional asset manager (QPAM).\nOn December 20, 2018, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and certain former officers of the firm alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act with respect to Group Inc.’s disclosures and public statements concerning 1MDB and seeking unspecified damages. The plaintiff filed the second amended complaint on October 28, 2019. On June 28, 2021, the court dismissed the claims against one of the individual defendants but denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss with respect to the firm and the remaining individual defendants. On August 4, 2023, the plaintiff filed a third amended complaint. On September 29, 2023, the plaintiff moved for class certification. On April 5, 2024, the Magistrate Judge recommended that the plaintiff’s motion for class certification be granted in part and denied in part. On May 3, 2024, the defendants filed objections to the Magistrate Judge’s report and recommendation with the district court.\nMortgage-Related Matters \nComplaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 25, 2019 and May 29, 2020 against Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and GS Mortgage Securities Corp. by U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee for two residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts that issued $\n1.7\n billion of securities. The complaints generally allege that mortgage loans in the trusts failed to conform to applicable representations and warranties and seek specific performance or, alternatively, compensatory damages and other relief. On November 23, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint in the first action and denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint in the second action. On January 14, 2021, amended complaints were filed in both actions. \nCurrencies-Related Litigation\n \nGS&Co. is among the defendants named in a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on August 4, 2021. The amended complaint, filed on January 6, 2022, generally asserts claims under federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy among the defendants to manipulate auctions for foreign exchange transactions on an electronic trading platform, as well as claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizatio\nns Act. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of treble and other damages. On May 18, 2023, the court dismissed certain state common law claims, but denied dismissal of the remaining claims. On July 7, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n219\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nBanco Espirito Santo S.A. and Oak Finance \nIn December 2014, September 2015 and December 2015, the Bank of Portugal (BoP) rendered decisions to reverse an earlier transfer to Novo Banco of an $\n835\n million facility agreement (the Facility), structured by GSI, between Oak Finance Luxembourg S.A. (Oak Finance), a special purpose vehicle formed in connection with the Facility, and Banco Espirito Santo S.A. (BES) prior to the failure of BES. In response, GSI and, with respect to the BoP’s December 2015 decision, GSIB commenced actions beginning in February 2015 against Novo Banco S.A. (Novo Banco) in the English Commercial Court and the BoP in the Portuguese Administrative Court. In July 2018, the English Supreme Court found that the English courts will not have jurisdiction over GSI’s action unless and until the Portuguese Administrative Court finds against BoP in GSI’s parallel action. In July 2018, the Liquidation Committee for BES issued a decision seeking to claw back from GSI $\n54\n million paid to GSI and $\n50\n million allegedly paid to Oak Finance in connection with the Facility, alleging that GSI acted in bad faith in extending the Facility, including because GSI allegedly knew that BES was at risk of imminent failure. In October 2018, GSI commenced an action in the Lisbon Commercial Court challenging the Liquidation Committee’s decision and has since also issued a claim against the Portuguese State seeking compensation for losses of approximately $\n222\n million related to the failure of BES, together with a contingent claim for the $\n104\n million sought by the Liquidation Committee. On April 11, 2023, GSI commenced administrative proceedings against the BoP, seeking the nullification of the BoP’s September 2015 and December 2015 decisions on new grounds.\nFinancial Advisory Services\n \nGroup Inc. and certain of its affiliates are from time to time parties to various civil litigation and arbitration proceedings and other disputes with clients and third parties relating to the firm’s financial advisory activities. These claims generally seek, among other things, compensatory damages and, in some cases, punitive damages, and in certain cases allege that the firm did not appropriately disclose or deal with conflicts of interest. \nArchegos-Related Matters \nGS&Co. is among the underwriters named as defendants in a putative securities class action filed on August 13, 2021 in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, relating to ViacomCBS Inc.’s (ViacomCBS) March 2021 public offerings of $\n1.7\n billion of common stock and $\n1.0\n billion of preferred stock. In addition to the underwriters, the defendants include ViacomCBS and certain of its officers and directors. GS&Co. underwrote \n646,154\n shares of common stock representing an aggregate offering price of approximately $\n55\n million and \n323,077\n shares of preferred stock representing an aggregate offering price of approximately $\n32\n million. The complaint asserts claims under the federal securities laws and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including, among other things, that the offering documents failed to disclose that Archegos Capital Management, LP (Archegos) had substantial exposure to ViacomCBS, including through total return swaps to which certain of the underwriters (the trading underwriters), including GS&Co., were allegedly counterparties, and that such underwriters failed to disclose their exposure to Archegos. On December 21, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a corrected amended complaint. The complaint seeks rescission and compensatory damages in unspecified amounts. On February 6, 2023, the trial court dismissed the claims against ViacomCBS and the individual defendants, but denied the defendants’ motions to dismiss with respect to GS&Co. and the other underwriter defendants. On January 4, 2024, the trial court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, and on February 14, 2024, the underwriter defendants appealed. On April 4, 2024, the Appellate Division for the First Department affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of the claims against ViacomCBS and the individual defendants, reversed the trial court’s failure to dismiss the claims against the non-trading underwriter defendants, and affirmed the trial court’s denial of the motion to dismiss claims against the trading underwriter defendants, including GS&Co. \nGroup Inc. is also a defendant in putative securities class actions filed beginning in October 2021 and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints allege that Group Inc., along with another financial institution, sold shares in Baidu Inc. (Baidu), Discovery Inc. (Discovery), GSX Techedu Inc. (Gaotu), iQIYI Inc. (iQIYI), Tencent Music Entertainment Group (Tencent), ViacomCBS, and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (Vipshop) based on material nonpublic information regarding the liquidation of Archegos’ position in Baidu, Discovery, Gaotu, iQIYI, Tencent, ViacomCBS and Vipshop, respectively. The complaints generally assert violations of Sections 10(b), 20A and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seek unspecified damages.

In addition to the underwriters, the defendants include agilon, certain of its officers and directors and certain of its shareholders. GS&Co. underwrote \n10,631,949\n shares of common stock in the April 2021 initial public offering representing an aggregate offering price of approximately $\n245\n million, \n3,759,588\n shares of common stock in the September 2021 secondary equity offering representing an aggregate offering price of approximately $\n113\n million and \n26,879,772\n shares of common stock in the May 2023 secondary equity offering, of which \n2,731,638\n shares were purchased by agilon, representing an aggregate offering price of approximately $\n519\n million sold to third parties.

These claims generally seek, among other things, restitution or other compensatory damages and, in some cases, punitive damages. \nVariable Rate Demand Obligations Antitrust Litigation \nGroup Inc. and GS&Co. were among the defendants named in a putative class action relating to variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs), filed beginning in February 2019 under separate complaints and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The consolidated amended complaint, filed on May 31, 2019, generally asserts claims under federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy among the defendants to manipulate the market for VRDOs. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of compensatory, treble and other damages. Group Inc. was voluntarily dismissed from the putative class action on June 3, 2019. On November 2, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss, dismissing the state common law claims against GS&Co., but denying dismissal of the federal antitrust law claims. \nGS&Co. is also among the defendants named in a related putative class action filed on June 2, 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges the same conspiracy in the market for VRDOs as that alleged in the consolidated amended complaint filed on May 31, 2019, and asserts federal antitrust law, state law and state common law claims against the defendants. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of compensatory, treble and other damages. On August 6, 2021, plaintiffs in the May 31, 2019 action filed an amended complaint consolidating the June 2, 2021 action with the May 31, 2019 action. On September 14, 2021, defendants filed a joint partial motion to dismiss the August 6, 2021 amended consolidated complaint. On June 28, 2022, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss, dismissing the state breach of fiduciary duty claim against GS&Co., but declining to dismiss any portion of the federal antitrust law claims. On September 21, 2023, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On February 5, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted the defendants’ petition seeking interlocutory review of the district court’s grant of class certification. On February 15, 2024, the district court granted the defendants’ request to stay the proceedings pending their appeal of the district court’s grant of class certification.\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n227\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInterest Rate Swap Antitrust Litigation\n \nGroup Inc., GS&Co., GSI, GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. are among the defendants named in a putative antitrust class action relating to the trading of interest rate swaps, filed in November 2015 and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The same Goldman Sachs entities are also among the defendants named in two antitrust actions relating to the trading of interest rate swaps, commenced in April 2016 and June 2018, respectively, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by three operators of swap execution facilities and certain of their affiliates. These actions have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings. The complaints generally assert claims under federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy among the defendants to preclude exchange trading of interest rate swaps. The complaints in the individual actions also assert claims under state antitrust law. The complaints seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as treble damages in an unspecified amount. Defendants moved to dismiss the class and the first individual action and the district court dismissed the state common law claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the first individual action and otherwise limited the state common law claim in the putative class action and the antitrust claims in both actions to the period from 2013 to 2016. On November 20, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the second individual action, dismissing the state common law claims for unjust enrichment and tortious interference, but denying dismissal of the federal and state antitrust claims. On March 13, 2019, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion in the putative class action to amend their complaint to add allegations related to conduct from 2008 to 2012, but granted the motion to add limited allegations from 2013 to 2016, which the plaintiffs added in a fourth consolidated amended complaint filed on March 22, 2019. On December 15, 2023, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, and on December 28, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit seeking interlocutory review of the district court’s denial of class certification. On July 11, 2024, the court preliminarily approved a settlement among the plaintiffs and certain defendants, including the firm, to resolve the class action. The firm has paid the full amount of its proposed contribution to the settlement into an escrow account. The individual actions remain pending.\nCommodities-Related Litigation \nGSI is among the defendants named in putative class actions relating to trading in platinum and palladium, filed beginning on November 25, 2014 and most recently amended on May 15, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The amended complaint generally alleges that the defendants violated federal antitrust laws and the Commodity Exchange Act in connection with an alleged conspiracy to manipulate a benchmark for physical platinum and palladium prices and seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as treble damages in an unspecified amount. On March 29, 2020, the court granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss and for reconsideration, resulting in the dismissal of all claims, and on February 27, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court’s dismissal of certain plaintiffs’ antitrust claims and vacated the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiffs’ Commodity Exchange Act claim. On April 12, 2023, the defendants’ petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was denied. On July 21, 2023, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. On January 17, 2025, the court approved a settlement to resolve this action. The firm has paid the full amount of its contribution to the settlement.\nCorporate Bonds Antitrust Litigation \nGroup Inc. and GS&Co. are among the dealers named as defendants in a putative class action relating to the secondary market for odd-lot corporate bonds, filed on April 21, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The amended consolidated complaint, filed on October 29, 2020, asserts claims under federal antitrust law in connection with alleged anti-competitive conduct by the defendants in the secondary market for odd-lots of corporate bonds, and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified monetary damages, including treble and punitive damages and restitution. On October 25, 2021, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss with prejudice. On November 10, 2022, the district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for an indicative ruling that the judgment should be vacated because the wife of the district judge owned stock in one of the defendants and the district judge did not recuse himself. On July 2, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the district court’s dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings. On September 3, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, and on October 18, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint.\n228\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCredit Default Swap Antitrust Litigation \nGroup Inc., GS&Co. and GSI were among the defendants named in a putative antitrust class action relating to the settlement of credit default swaps, filed on June 30, 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico. The complaint generally asserts claims under federal antitrust law and the Commodity Exchange Act in connection with an alleged conspiracy among the defendants to manipulate the benchmark price used to value credit default swaps for settlement. The complaint also asserts a claim for unjust enrichment under state common law. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of treble and other damages. On November 15, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On February 4, 2022, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and voluntarily dismissed Group Inc. from the action. On June 5, 2023, the court dismissed the claims against certain foreign defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction but denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss with respect to GS&Co., GSI and the remaining defendants. On January 24, 2024, the court granted the defendants’ motion to stay the proceedings pending the resolution of the motion filed by the defendants on November 3, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce a 2015 settlement and release among the parties. On January 26, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the defendants’ motion to enforce the settlement and release and enjoined the plaintiffs from pursuing any claims against the defendants in the New Mexico action for any alleged violation of law based on conduct before June 30, 2014, and on February 23, 2024, the plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nConsumer Investigation and Review\nThe firm has been cooperating with the CFPB and other governmental bodies relating to investigations and/or inquiries concerning GS Bank USA’s credit card account management practices and is providing information regarding the application of refunds, crediting of nonconforming payments, billing error resolution, advertisements, reporting to credit bureaus, and any other consumer-related information requested by them, and GS Bank USA has entered into a consent order, without admitting or denying the findings, to resolve the CFPB’s investigation. The consent order requires a $\n45\n million penalty, approximately $\n20\n million in restitution (to be offset by restitution GS Bank USA has already provided to consumers), and certain non-monetary remedial measures. The firm has paid the full amount of the settlement.\nRegulatory Investigations and Reviews and Related Litigation\nGroup Inc. and certain of its affiliates are subject to a number of other investigations and reviews by, and, in some cases, have received subpoenas and requests for documents and information from, various governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations and litigation and shareholder requests relating to various matters relating to the firm’s businesses and operations, including: \n•\nThe securities offering process and underwriting practices; \n•\nThe firm’s investment management and financial advisory services; \n•\nConflicts of interest; \n•\nResearch practices, including research independence and interactions between research analysts and other firm personnel, including investment banking personnel, as well as third parties; \n•\nTransactions involving government-related financings and other matters, municipal securities, including wall-cross procedures and conflict of interest disclosure with respect to state and municipal clients, the trading and structuring of municipal derivative instruments in connection with municipal offerings, political contribution rules, municipal advisory services and the possible impact of credit default swap transactions on municipal issuers; \n•\nConsumer lending, as well as residential mortgage lending, servicing and securitization, and compliance with related consumer laws; \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n229\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n•\nThe offering, auction, sales, trading and clearance of corporate and government securities, currencies, commodities and other financial products and related sales and other communications and activities, as well as the firm’s supervision and controls relating to such activities, including compliance with applicable short sale rules, algorithmic, high-frequency and quantitative trading, the firm’s U.S. alternative trading system (dark pool), futures trading, options trading, when-issued trading, transaction and regulatory reporting, technology systems and controls, communications recordkeeping and recording, securities lending practices, prime brokerage activities, trading and clearance of credit derivative instruments and interest rate swaps, commodities activities and metals storage, private placement practices, allocations of and trading in securities, and trading activities and communications in connection with the establishment of benchmark rates, such as currency rates;\n•\nCompliance with the FCPA;\n•\nThe firm’s hiring and compensation practices;\n•\nThe firm’s system of risk management and controls; and\n•\nInsider trading, the potential misuse and dissemination of material nonpublic information regarding corporate and governmental developments and the effectiveness of the firm’s insider trading controls and information barriers.\nThe firm is cooperating with all such governmental and regulatory investigations and reviews.\nNote 28.\n \nEmployee Benefit Plans\nThe firm sponsors various pension plans and certain other postretirement benefit plans, primarily healthcare and life insurance. The firm also provides certain benefits to former or inactive employees prior to retirement. \nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and Postretirement Plans\nEmployees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries participate in various defined benefit pension plans. These plans generally provide benefits based on years of credited service and a percentage of eligible compensation. The firm maintains a defined benefit pension plan for certain U.K. employees. As of April 2008, the U.K. defined benefit plan was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants as of March 31, 2016. The non-U.S. plans do not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated results of operations. \nThe firm also maintains a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to November 1, 2003. As of November 2004, this plan was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants. In addition, the firm maintains unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for eligible retirees and their dependents covered under these programs. These plans do not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated results of operations.\nThe firm recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation, in the consolidated balance sheets.\n As of December 2024, other assets included $\n73\n million (related to overfunded pension plans) and other liabilities included $\n344\n million related to these plans. As of December 2023, other assets included $\n93\n million (related to overfunded pension plans) and other liabilities included $\n449\n million related to these plans. \nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe firm contributes to employer-sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans. The firm’s contribution to these plans was $\n382\n million for 2024, $\n377\n million for 2023 and $\n378\n million for 2022.\n230\nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 29.\n \nEmployee Incentive Plans\nThe cost of employee services received in exchange for a share-based award is generally measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Share-based awards that do not require future service (i.e., vested awards, including awards granted to retirement-eligible employees) are expensed immediately. Share-based awards that require future service are amortized over the relevant service period. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur. \nCash dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged to retained earnings. If RSUs that require future service are forfeited, the related dividend equivalents originally charged to retained earnings are reclassified to compensation expense in the period in which forfeiture occurs.\nThe firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon delivery of share-based awards. In limited cases, as outlined in the applicable award agreements, the firm may cash settle share-based awards accounted for as equity instruments. For these awards, additional paid-in capital is adjusted to the extent of the difference between the value of the award at the time of cash settlement and the grant-date value of the award. The tax effect related to the settlement of share-based awards and payments of dividend equivalents is recorded in income tax benefit or expense. \nStock Incentive Plan\nThe firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2021) (2021 SIP), which provides for grants of RSUs, restricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other share-based awards, each of which may be subject to terms and conditions, including performance or market conditions. On April 29, 2021, shareholders approved the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is a successor to several predecessor stock incentive plans, the first of which was adopted on April 30, 1999, and each of which was approved by the firm’s shareholders.\nAs of December 2024, \n55.7\n million shares were available to be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. If any shares of common stock underlying awards granted under the 2021 SIP or awards granted under predecessor stock incentive plans are not delivered because such awards are forfeited, terminated or canceled, or if shares of common stock underlying such awards are surrendered or withheld to satisfy any obligation of the grantee (including taxes), those shares will become available to be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. Shares available to be delivered under the 2021 SIP also are subject to adjustment for certain events or changes in corporate structure as provided under the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is scheduled to terminate on the date of the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nRestricted Stock Units \nThe firm grants RSUs (including RSUs subject to performance or market conditions) to employees, which are generally valued based on the closing price of the underlying shares on the date of grant, after taking into account a liquidity discount for any applicable post-vesting and delivery transfer restrictions. The value of equity awards also considers the impact of material non-public information, if any, that the firm expects to make available shortly following grant. RSUs not subject to performance or market conditions generally vest and underlying shares of common stock are delivered (net of required withholding tax) over a \nthree-year\n period as outlined in the applicable award agreements. Award agreements generally provide that vesting is accelerated in certain circumstances, such as on retirement, death, disability and, in certain cases, conflicted employment. Delivery of the underlying shares of common stock is conditioned on the grantees satisfying certain vesting and other requirements outlined in the award agreements. \nRSUs that are subject to performance or market conditions generally are settled after the end of a \nthree\n- to \nfive-year\n period. For awards that are subject to performance or market conditions, generally the final award is adjusted from \nzero\n up to \n150\n% of the original grant based on the extent to which those conditions are satisfied. Dividend equivalents that accrue on these awards are paid when the awards settle. \nGoldman Sachs 2024 Form 10-K\n231\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These RSUs are subject to additional conditions as outlined in the award agreements. Shares underlying these RSUs, net of required withholding tax, generally are delivered over a \nthree-year\n period and are generally subject to a \none-year\n post-vesting and delivery transfer restriction. These awards are not included in the table above.\nAs of December 2024, there was $\n630\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based awards.
