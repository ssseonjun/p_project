however an estimate\n \nof the amount of these charges \nhas not yet been determined. \nDuring the year ended December 28, 2024, in connection with the 2024 Plan,\n \nwe recorded an impairment of \ngoodwill and intangible assets of $13 million related to the disposal of a portion\n \nof a business.\n \nThis impairment is \nincluded in the $73 million of restructuring charges discussed above and related\n \nto the Global Specialty Products \nsegment. \nOn August 1, 2022, we committed to a restructuring plan (the “2022\n \nPlan”) focused on funding the priorities of the \nBOLD+1 strategic plan, streamlining operations and other initiatives to\n \nincrease efficiency.\n \nThe 2022 Plan has \nbeen completed as of July 31, 2024.\n \nDuring the years ended December 28, 2024, December\n \n30, 2023, and \nDecember 31, 2022, in connection with our 2022 Plan, we recorded restructuring\n \ncosts of $37 million, $80 million, \nand $128 million, respectively.\n \nThe restructuring costs for these periods primarily related to\n \nseverance and \nemployee-related costs, accelerated amortization of right-of-use\n \nlease assets and fixed assets, impairment of \nintangible assets related to disposal of a U.S. business,\n \nand other exit costs.\n \nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, in connection with the 2022 Plan,\n \nwe recorded an impairment of an \nintangible asset of $12 million related to disposal of a U.S. business.\n \nThis impairment is included in the $80 \nmillion of restructuring costs discussed above and related to the Global Specialty\n \nProducts segment.\n \nThe disposal \nwas completed during the first quarter of 2024.\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, in connection with the 2022 Plan,\n \nwe vacated one of the buildings at our \ncorporate headquarters in Melville, New York, which resulted in an accelerated amortization of a right-of-use lease \nasset of $34 million.\n \nWe also initiated the disposal of a non-profitable U.S. business within the Global Specialty \nProducts segment and recorded related costs of $49 million, which primarily\n \nconsisted of impairment of intangible \nassets and goodwill, inventory impairment, and severance and employee-related\n \ncosts, which are included in the \nGlobal Specialty Products segment.\n \nThese costs are included in the $128 million of restructuring\n \ncharges discussed \nabove.\n \nThe disposal was completed during the first quarter of 2023.\n \nOn August 26, 2022, we acquired Midway Dental Supply.\n \nIn connection with this acquisition, during the year \nended December 31, 2022, we recorded integration costs of $3 million\n \nrelated to one-time employee and other \ncosts, as well as restructuring charges of $9 million, which are included in the\n \n$128 million of restructuring charges \ndiscussed above.\n \nThe integration and restructuring costs related to Midway Dental\n \nSupply are recorded in the \nGlobal Distribution and Value-Added Services segment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n54 \n2024 Compared to 2023 \nNote: Percentages for Net Sales;

above.\n \nThe 4.2% decrease in our internally generated local currency sales was primarily\n \nattributable to a decrease in sales \nof PPE products and COVID-19 test kits.\n \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the estimated\n \nincrease in \ninternally generated local currency sales, excluding PPE products\n \nand COVID-19 test kits, was 3.5%.\n \nHowever, as \na result of the adverse impact of the 2023 cyber incident during the quarter ended\n \nDecember 30, 2023, our \ninternally generated local currency sales, excluding sales of PPE products\n \nand COVID-19 test kits, on a full year \nbasis were flat compared to the prior year. \nGlobal Distribution and Value-Added Services Sales \nGlobal Distribution and Value-Added Services net sales for the year ended December 30, 2023 decreased 3.8%.\n \nThe components of our sales decline are presented in the table above.\n \nThe 0.6% decrease in internally generated local currency dental sales was attributable\n \nto a decrease in sales of \ndental merchandise and dental equipment as a result of the adverse\n \nimpact of the 2023 cyber incident. \nThe 11.0% decrease in internally generated local currency medical sales is primarily attributable\n \nto the impact of \nthe 2023 cyber incident and to lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19\n \ntest kits and other point-of-care \ndiagnostic products. \nThe acquisition growth in medical sales was attributable to our expansion\n \nin the Home Solutions market, including \nthe acquisition of Shield Healthcare during the year ended December\n \n30, 2023.\n \nThe acquisition growth in value-\nadded services was attributable primarily to an acquisition of a practice\n \ntransitions business in 2023. \nThe increase in internally generated local currency value-added services\n \nsales is attributable to an increase in our \ndental billing solutions, partially offset by the expiration, during the year ended\n \nDecember 31, 2022, of a modestly \nprofitable government contract in one of our value-added services businesses.\n \nWe estimate that sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits were approximately $710\n \nmillion for the year \nended December 30, 2023\n \nas compared to $1,238 million for the year ended December 31, 2022\n \nrepresenting an \nestimated decrease of $528 million.\n \nThe estimated $528 million net decrease in sales of PPE products\n \nand COVID-\n19 test kits represents 5.0%\n \nof Global Distribution and Value-Added Services net sales for the year ended \nDecember 30, 2023 and was primarily due to lower market prices and loss of\n \ndemand during the 2023 cyber \nincident.\n \nExcluding PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, our internally\n \ngenerated local currency sales were flat. \nGlobal Specialty Products \nGlobal Specialty Products net sales for the year ended December 30, 2023\n \nincreased 4.6%.\n \nThe components of \nsales increase are presented in the table above. \nThe decrease in internally generated local currency sales was primarily\n \nattributable to lower sales in our \northodontics business,\n \npartially impacted by a patent expiration and the October 2023\n \ncyber incident and declines in \ncertain other health care related consumable merchandise products. \nThe acquisition growth in Global Specialty Products sales was attributable\n \nto the

result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks\n \nthroughout our \nindustry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.\n \nGross margin \npercentages vary between our segments.\n \nWe realize substantially higher gross margin from sales of products that \nwe develop and manufacture within our Global Specialty Products segment\n \ncompared to gross margin from sales of \nproducts that we distribute within our Global Distribution and Value-Added Services segment.\n \nWithin our Global \nTechnology segment, higher gross margins result from us being both the developer and seller of software products \nand services.\n \nWithin our Global Distribution and Value\n \n-Added Services segment, gross profit margins may vary between the \nperiods as a result of the changes in the mix of products sold as well as\n \nchanges in our customer mix.\n \nFor example, \nsales of our corporate brand and certain specialty products achieve\n \ngross profit margins that are higher than average \ntotal gross profit margins of all products.\n \nWith respect to customer mix, sales to our large-group customers are \ntypically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed\n \nto the gross margin on sales \nto office-based practitioners, who normally purchase lower volumes.\n \nThe decrease in Global Distribution and Value-Added Services gross profit for the year ended December 30, 2023 \ncompared to the prior year was due to the 2023 cyber incident and a\n \nreduction in sales of PPE products and \nCOVID-19 test kits, partially offset by additional gross profit from acquisitions. \nThe increase in Global Specialty Products gross profit is primarily attributable\n \nto gross profit from our acquisitions \noffset by lower gross profit from our orthodontics business and certain other health\n \ncare related consumable \nmerchandise products.\n \nThe increase in gross margin rates was due to a favorable impact of sales mix. \nThe increase in Global Technology gross profit reflects increased local currency revenues and additional gross \nprofit from acquisitions.

year.\n \nIn \neach year, the difference between our effective and federal statutory tax rates primarily relates to state and foreign \nincome taxes and interest expense. \nThe Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) issued\n \ntechnical and administrative \nguidance on Pillar Two rules in December 2021, which provides for a global minimum tax rate on the earnings of \nlarge multinational businesses on a country-by-country basis.\n \nEffective January 1, 2024, the minimum global tax \nrate is 15% for various jurisdictions pursuant to the Pillar Two rules.\n \nFuture tax reform resulting from these \ndevelopments may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which\n \nmay adversely impact our effective tax \nrate going forward or result in higher cash tax liabilities.\n \nAs of December 30, 2023, the impact of the Pillar Two \nrules to our financial statements was immaterial. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n64 \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nOur principal capital requirements have included funding of acquisitions, purchases\n \nof additional noncontrolling \ninterests, repayments of debt principal, the funding of working capital needs,\n \npurchases of fixed assets and \nrepurchases of common stock.\n \nWorking capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special \ninventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables\n \nand payables.\n \nHistorically, sales have \ntended to be stronger during the second half of the year and special inventory\n \nforward buy-in opportunities have \nbeen most prevalent just before the end of the year, and have caused our working capital requirements\n \nto be higher \nfrom the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of\n \nthe following year. \nWe finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt \nplacements.\n \nPlease see \nNote 14 – Debt\n \nfor further information.\n \nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flows from \noperations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers\n \nfor our products and services, and access to \nproducts and services from our suppliers. \nOur business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which\n \nis susceptible to fluctuations during the \nyear as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.\n \nInventory purchase activity is a function of \nsales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory. \nWe finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months.\n \nFunding requirements are based on \nforecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may\n \nchange.\n \nConsequently, we may change \nour funding structure to reflect any new requirements. \nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets, \nand our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with\n \nsufficient liquidity to meet our currently \nforeseeable short-term and long-term capital needs. \nOur acquisition strategy is focused on investments in companies that\n \nadd new customers and sales teams, increase \nour geographic footprint (whether entering a new country, such as emerging markets, or building scale where we \nhave already invested in businesses), and finally, those that enable us to access new products and technologies. \nNet cash provided by operating activities was $848 million for the\n \nyear ended December 28, 2024, compared to net \ncash provided by operating activities of $500 million for the prior year.\n \nThe net change of $348 million was \nprimarily attributable to changes in working capital accounts (primarily accounts\n \nreceivable and inventory), and \nhigher cash net income.\n \nThe residual impacts of the 2023 cyber incident on our working\n \ncapital during the year \nended December 28, 2024 included an increase in operating cash flows from\n \naccounts receivable due to improved \ncollection levels and decreased cash flows from accounts payable and accrued\n \nexpenses resulting from previously \ndelayed payments. \nNet cash used in investing activities was $430 million for the year\n \nended December 28, 2024, compared to net cash \nused in investing activities of $1,135 million for the prior year.\n \nThe net change of $705 million was primarily \nattributable to decreased payments for equity investments and business\n \nacquisitions. \nNet cash used in financing activities was $510 million for the year\n \nended December 28, 2024, compared to net cash \nprovided by financing activities of $701 million for the prior year.\n \nThe net change of $1,211 million was primarily \ndue to decreased net borrowings from debt to finance our investments,\n \nincreased acquisitions of noncontrolling \ninterests in subsidiaries and increased repurchases of common stock.

further information. \nStock Repurchases \nOn January 27, 2025, our Board authorized the repurchase of up\n \nto an additional $500 million in shares of our \ncommon stock. \nFrom March 3, 2003 through December 28, 2024, we repurchased $5.1\n \nbillion, or 95,814,454 shares, under our \ncommon stock repurchase programs, with $380 million available\n \nas of December 28, 2024 for future common stock \nshare repurchases.\n \nSubject to market conditions and other factors, we plan to continue\n \nto accelerate our share \nrepurchase activity. \nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests \nSome minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right,\n \nat certain times, to require us to acquire \ntheir ownership interest in those entities at fair value.\n \nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 480-10 is \napplicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required\n \nto purchase all or a portion of the \noutstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling\n \ninterest holder under the terms of a put \noption contained in contractual agreements.\n \nAs of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, our balance\n \nfor \nredeemable noncontrolling interests was $806 million and $864 million,\n \nrespectively.\n \nPlease see \nNote 20 –\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n \nfor further information. \nUnrecognized tax benefits\n \nAs more fully disclosed in \nNote 15 – Income Taxes\n \nof “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” we cannot \nreasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to our unrecognized\n \ntax benefits, including accrued \ninterest, of $108 million and $115 million as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.\n \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting policies are described in \nNote 1 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n \nof the \nconsolidated financial statements.\n \nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us\n \nto make \nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues\n \nand expenses and related \ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.\n \nWe base our estimates on historical data, when available, \nexperience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions\n \nthat are believed to be reasonable under \nthe circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for\n \nmaking judgments about the carrying values of \nassets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\n \nWe believe that the estimates, judgments and \nassumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information\n \navailable to us at the time that these \nestimates, judgments and assumptions are made.\n \nHowever, by their nature, estimates are subject to various \nassumptions and uncertainties.\n \nTherefore, reported results may differ from estimates and any such differences may \nbe material to our consolidated financial statements.\n \nWe believe that the following critical accounting estimates, which have been discussed with the Audit Committee \nof our Board, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation\n \nof our consolidated financial \nstatements: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n67 \nInventories and Reserves\nInventories consist primarily of finished goods, raw materials and\n \nwork-in-process and are valued at the lower of \ncost or net realizable value.\n \nCost is determined by the weighted average method for merchandise and\n \nactual cost \nfor large equipment,\n \nhigh tech equipment and drop-shipments.\n \nWe include product costs, labor, and related fixed \nand variable overhead in the cost of inventory\n \nthat we manufacture.\n \nIn estimating carrying value of inventory, we \nconsider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory\n \nby reviewing on-hand quantities, \nhistorical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.\n \nBusiness Combinations \nThe estimated fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets (i.e., customer\n \nrelationships and lists, trademarks \nand trade names, product development and non-compete agreements)\n \nis based on critical judgments and \nassumptions derived from analysis of market conditions, including discount\n \nrates, projected revenue growth rates \n(which are based on historical trends and assessment of financial projections),\n \nestimated customer attrition and \nprojected cash flows.\n \nThese assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic\n \nand market \nconditions.\n \nPlease see \nNote 5 – Business Acquisitions\n \nfor further discussion of our acquisitions. \nGoodwill \nGoodwill is subject to impairment analysis at least once annually as\n \nof the first day of our fourth quarter, or if an \nevent occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than\n \nnot reduce a reporting unit’s fair value below \ncarrying value.\n \nWe regard our reporting units to be our operating segments or one level below the operating \nsegments.\n \nGoodwill is allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of\n \npreparing our impairment analyses, \nbased on a specific identification basis.\n \nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including\n \nthe identification of reporting units, \nassignment of assets and liabilities that are considered shared services\n \nto the reporting units, and ultimately the \ndetermination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\n \nThe fair value of each reporting unit is calculated by \napplying the discounted cash flow methodology and confirming with\n \na market approach.\n \nThere are inherent \nuncertainties, however, related to fair value models, the inputs and our judgments in applying them\n \nto this analysis.\n \nThe most significant inputs include estimation of detailed future cash flows based\n \non budget expectations, and \ndetermination of comparable companies to develop a weighted average\n \ncost of capital for each reporting unit.\n \nOn an annual basis, we prepare financial projections.\n \nThese projections are based on input from our leadership and \nare presented annually to our Board.\n \nInfluences on this year's forecasted financial information and\n \nthe fair value \nmodel include: the impact of planned strategic initiatives, the continued\n \nintegration of recent acquisitions and \noverall market conditions.\n \nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change\n \nfrom year to \nyear based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors.\nDuring the year ended December 28, 2024, we engaged third-party valuation\n \nspecialists to determine the relative \nfair value of our goodwill related to the revision of our reportable segments.\n \nOur management reviewed and \napproved this valuation. \nDuring the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 28, 2024,\n \nwe revised our segment structure to align \nwith how our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer manages the business, assesses\n \nperformance and allocates \nresources.\n \nOur revised reportable segments now consist of: (i) Global Distribution\n \nand Value\n \n-Added Services; (ii) \nGlobal Specialty Products; and (iii) Global Technology.\n \nReporting units under the former structure were tested for \nimpairment, and no impairment was identified.\n \nAs a result of the realignment and the change in operating \nsegments, we reallocated goodwill to each of our new reporting units using\n \na relative fair value approach.\n \nBased on \nthe impairment test under the new structure, it was determined that the\n \nfair values of our reporting units more likely \nthan not exceeded their carrying values, resulting in no impairment.\n \nFor both the former and new structure \ngoodwill impairment tests as of September 30, 2024, the fair values of reporting\n \nunits were computed using the \nmethodology described above. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n68 \nIn connection with our restructuring initiatives, during the year ended\n \nDecember 28, 2024, we recorded an $11 \nmillion impairment of goodwill in the Global Specialty Products segment,\n \nrelating to the disposal of a portion of a \nbusiness; such impairment was calculated based on the relative fair value of\n \ngoodwill.\n \nFor the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, in connection with our restructuring activities, we\n \nrecorded a $20 million impairment of \ngoodwill, in the Global Specialty Products segment, relating to the disposal\n \nof an unprofitable business for which \nestimated fair value was lower than carrying value.\n \nApart from the above impairments identified in connection with\n \nour restructuring initiative, we did not record any \nadditional impairment during the years ended December 28, 2024, December\n \n30, 2023, and December 31, 2022.\n \nWe performed our annual quantitative testing for the remaining goodwill and the fair value of each of our reporting \nunits sufficiently exceeded the carrying values.\n \nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \nAnnually or if we identify an impairment indicator,\n \ndefinite-lived intangible assets such as non-compete \nagreements, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships and lists, and\n \nproduct development are reviewed for \nimpairment indicators.\n \nIf any impairment indicators exist, quantitative testing\n \nis performed on the asset. \nThe quantitative impairment model is a two-step test under which we\n \nfirst calculate the recoverability of the \ncarrying value by comparing the undiscounted projected cash flows associated\n \nwith the asset or asset group, \nincluding its estimated residual value, to the carrying amount.\n \nIf the cash flows associated with the asset or asset \ngroup are less than the carrying value, we perform a fair value assessment\n \nof the asset, or asset group.\n \nIf the \ncarrying amount is found to be greater than the fair value, we record an\n \nimpairment loss for the excess of book \nvalue over the fair value.\n \nIn addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful \nlives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.\n \nAlthough we believe our judgments, estimates and/or \nassumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value\n \nare reasonable, making material changes to \nsuch judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect such impairment\n \nanalyses and our financial \nresults.\n \nDuring the year ended December 28, 2024, we recorded $4 million of\n \nimpairment charges related to businesses in \nour Global Distribution and Value-Added Services segment.\n \nIt included $2 million of a trade name impairment, \ncalculated using the relative fair value, related to a disposal of a business,\n \nand $1 million related to trade name \nimpairment due to business integration in connection with our restructuring\n \ninitiatives.\n \nThe remaining $1 million \nimpairment charges related to trade names and non-compete agreements and were\n \ncalculated as the differences \nbetween the carrying values and the estimated fair values of the impaired\n \nintangible assets, using a discounted \nestimate of future cash flows. \n \nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, we recorded $19 million of\n \nimpairment charges related to businesses in \nour Global Distribution and Value-Added Services segment, consisting of $7 million primarily related to customer \nlists and relationships attributable to lower than anticipated operating\n \nmargins in certain businesses, and a $12 \nmillion charge related to the planned exit of a business in connection with our restructuring\n \ninitiatives.\n \nThese \nimpairment charges were calculated as the differences between the carrying values and the\n \nestimated fair values of \nthe impaired intangible assets, using a discounted estimate of future\n \ncash flows. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $49 million of\n \nimpairment charges related to businesses in \nour Global Distribution and Value-Added Services segment, consisting of a $15 million charge related to the \ndisposal of an unprofitable business in connection with our restructuring\n \ninitiatives, and a $34 million charge \nrelated to customer lists and relationships attributable to customer attrition rates\n \nbeing higher than expected in \ncertain other Global Distribution and Value-Added Services businesses.\n \nThese impairment charges were calculated \nas the differences between the carrying values and the estimated fair values of\n \nthe impaired intangible assets, using \na discounted estimate of future cash flows. \nPlease see \nNote 16 – Plans of Restructuring and Integration Costs\n \nfor additional details. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n69 \nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests \nSome minority stockholders in certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have\n \nthe right, at certain times, to require us \nto acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.\n \nThe redemption amounts have been estimated \nbased on recent transactions and/or implied multiples of earnings\n \nand, if such earnings and cash flows are not \nachieved, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests might be impacted.\n \nSee \nNote 1 – Basis of \nPresentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n \nand \nNote 20 – Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n \nfor additional \ninformation. \nIncome Tax \nWhen determining if the realization of a deferred tax asset is likely to assess\n \nthe need to record a valuation \nallowance, estimates and judgement are required.\n \nWe \nconsider all available evidence, both positive and negative, \nincluding estimated future taxable earnings, ongoing planning strategies,\n \nfuture reversals of existing temporary \ndifferences and historical operating results.\n \nAdditionally, changes to tax laws and statutory tax rates can have an \nimpact on our determination.\n \nWe \nevaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized \nin the financial statements in accordance with provisions contained within\n \nits guidance.\n \nThis topic prescribes a \nrecognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement\n \nrecognition and measurement of tax \npositions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\n \nFor those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be \nmore likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.\n \nThe amount recognized is \nmeasured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being\n \nrealized upon ultimate \naudit settlement.\n \nIn the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject\n \nto examination by various taxing \nauthorities.\n \nSuch examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments\n \nby these taxing authorities for \nuncertain tax positions taken in respect of certain tax matters.\n \nPlease see \nNote 15 – Income Taxes\n \nfor further \ndiscussion.

are exposed to market risks, interest rate risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as \nmeasured against the U.S. dollar and each other, and changes to the credit markets.\n \nWe attempt to minimize these \nrisks primarily by using foreign currency forward contracts and by\n \nmaintaining counter-party credit limits.\n \nThese \nhedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange\n \nand credit risks.\n \nFactors that could \ninfluence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and\n \navailability of hedging \ninstruments and liquidity of the credit markets.\n \nAll foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are \ncomponents of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose\n \nof hedging an existing or anticipated \ncurrency exposure.\n \nWe do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by \ndiversifying our investments, maintaining a strong balance sheet and having\n \nmultiple sources of capital. \nForeign Currency \nThe value of certain foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar may\n \naffect our financial results.\n \nFluctuations in \nexchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses\n \nand retained \nearnings, all of which are expressed in U.S. dollars.\n \nWhere we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs \nusing primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting\n \nthe impact of foreign currency exchange rate \nfluctuations on earnings.\n \nWe purchase short-term (i.e., generally 18 months or less) foreign currency forward \ncontracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany\n \nloans due from our international \nsubsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign\n \nsuppliers.\n \nWe do not hedge the translation of \nforeign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we consider foreign\n \ncurrency translation to be an accounting exposure, \nnot an economic exposure.\n \nA hypothetical 5% change in the average value of the U.S. dollar in 2024 compared\n \nto \nforeign currencies would have changed our 2024 reported Net income\n \nattributable to Henry Schein, Inc. by \napproximately $7 million. \nAs of December 28, 2024, our forward foreign currency exchange agreements,\n \nwhich expire through November 3, \n2028, had a fair value of $12 million as determined by quoted market prices.\n \nIncluded in the forward foreign \ncurrency exchange agreements, Henry Schein, Inc. had net investment\n \ndesignated EUR/USD forward contracts \nwith notional values of approximately €300 million and reported fair values\n \nof $9 million.\n \nA 5% increase in the \nvalue of the Euro to the USD from December 28, 2024 would decrease the fair\n \nvalue of these forward contracts by \n$17 million. \nTotal\n \nReturn Swaps \nOn March 20, 2020, we entered into a total return swap for the purpose\n \nof economically hedging our unfunded non-\nqualified supplemental retirement plan and our deferred compensation plan obligation.\n \nAt inception, the notional value of the investments in these plans was $43\n \nmillion.\n \nAt December 28, 2024, the \nnotional value of the investments in these plans was $106 million.\n \nAt December 28, 2024, the financing blended \nrate for this swap was based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n \n(“SOFR”) of 4.53% plus 0.61%, for a \ncombined rate of 5.14%.\n \nFor the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023, and\n \nDecember 31, 2022 we \nhave recorded a gain/(loss), within selling, general and administrative\n \nexpense, of approximately $8 million, $10 \nmillion and $(17) million, respectively, net of transaction costs, related to this undesignated swap.\n \nThis swap is \nexpected to be renewed on an annual basis and is expected to result\n \nin a neutral impact to our results of operations.\n \nCredit Risk Monitoring \nWe limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivative instruments by \nmonitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are\n \nthe counterparties to such financial \ninstruments.\n \nAs a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing \nnumerous investment grade counterparties. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n71 \nInterest Rate Risk \nAs of December 28, 2024, we had variable interest rate exposure for certain\n \nof our revolving credit facilities and \nour U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization. \nOur revolving credit facility,\n \nwhich we entered into on July 11,\n \n2023 and expires on July 11, 2028,\n \nhas a variable \ninterest rate that is based on the SOFR plus a spread based on our leverage\n \nratio at the end of each financial \nreporting quarter.\n \nAs of December 28, 2024, there was $0 million outstanding under\n \nthis revolving credit facility.\n \nDuring the year ended December 28, 2024, the average outstanding balance was\n \napproximately $50 million.\n \nBased \nupon our average outstanding balances, for each hypothetical increase\n \nof 25 basis points, our interest expense \nthereunder would have increased by $0.1 million. \nOur U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization, which we entered\n \ninto on April 17, 2013 and expires on \nDecember 6, 2027, has a variable interest rate that is based upon the asset-backed\n \ncommercial paper rate.\n \nAs of \nDecember 28, 2024, the commercial paper rate was 4.73% plus 0.75%,\n \nfor a combined rate of 5.48%,\n \nand the \noutstanding balance under this securitization facility was $150 million.\n \nDuring the year ended December 28, 2024, \nthe average outstanding balance was approximately $252 million.\n \nBased upon our average outstanding balances, \nfor each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points, our interest expense thereunder\n \nwould have increased by $1 \nmillion. \nOn July 11, 2023, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flow of our variable\n \nrate $750 \nmillion floating debt term loan facility, with three years maturity, effectively changing the floating rate portion of \nour obligation to a fixed rate.\n \nUnder the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we receive variable\n \ninterest \npayments based on the one-month Term SOFR rate and pay interest at a fixed rate.\n \nAs of December 28, 2024, the \nnotional value of the interest rate swap agreements was $713\n \nmillion.\n \nOn July 11, 2023, we entered into a three-year $750 million term loan credit agreement (the “Term Credit \nAgreement”).\n \nThe interest rate on this term loan is based on the Term SOFR plus a spread based on our leverage \nratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter.\n \nThis term loan matures on July 11, 2026.\n \nAt December 28, \n2024, the interest rate under the Term Credit Agreement was 4.45% plus 1.60% for a combined rate of 6.05%.\n \nHowever, we have a hedge in place (see \nNote 13 – Derivatives and Hedging Activities\n \nfor additional information) \nthat ultimately creates an effective fixed rate of 6.04%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTable of Contents\n72 \nITEM 8.\n \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nHENRY SCHEIN, INC. \nPage \nNumber\nReport of

(“TriMed”) in \n2024. As a result of this acquisition, management was required\n \nto determine the fair values of the identifiable assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed. In connection with the acquisition of TriMed, the Company recorded\n \n$204 million \nof identifiable intangible assets related to product development. \nWe identified the revenue growth rates for certain periods used in the determination of the fair value of the acquired \nproduct development in the acquisition of TriMed as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our \ndetermination was the subjective judgement required by management\n \nin formulating these revenue growth rates. \nAuditing these considerations involved especially subjective\n \nand challenging auditor judgement due to the nature \nand extent of audit effort required to address these matters. \nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter\n \nincluded: \n●\nEvaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth rates used in the determination\n \nof the fair values of the \nacquired product development\n \nin the\n \nacquisition of TriMed\n \nby: (i) reviewing\n \nthe historical performance\n \nof \nthe acquired company utilizing their\n \nfinancial statements, and (ii)\n \nassessing the revenue

clinics and alternate care clinics.\n \nWe also provide software and technology \nservices to health care practitioners.\n \nOur dental businesses serve office-based dental practitioners, dental \nlaboratories, schools, government and other institutions.\n \nOur medical businesses serve physician offices, urgent \ncare centers, ambulatory care sites, emergency medical technicians, dialysis centers,\n \nhome health, federal and state \ngovernments and large enterprises, such as group practices and integrated delivery\n \nnetworks, among other providers \nacross a wide range of specialties. \nWe have operations or affiliates in the United States, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, \nChina, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, \nLuxembourg, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Portugal, South\n \nAfrica, Spain, \nSweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.\nBasis of Presentation \nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry\n \nSchein, Inc. and all of our controlled \nsubsidiaries and VIE.\n \nAll intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated\n \nin consolidation.\n \nInvestments in \nunconsolidated affiliates for which we have the ability to influence the operating or\n \nfinancial decisions are \naccounted for under the equity method.\n \nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform\n \nto the \ncurrent period presentation.\n \nThese reclassifications, individually and in the aggregate, did not\n \nhave a material \nimpact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations\n \nor cash flows. \nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the assets and\n \nliabilities of the VIE.\n \nWe are deemed to \nbe the primary beneficiary of the VIE when we have the power to direct activities\n \nthat most significantly affect its \neconomic performance and have the obligation to absorb the majority\n \nof its losses or the right to receive benefits \nthat could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n \nIn determining whether we are the primary beneficiary, we \nconsider factors such as ownership interest, debt investments, management\n \nrepresentation, authority to control \ndecisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of each party.\n \nFor this VIE, the trade accounts \nreceivable transferred to the VIE are pledged as collateral to the related debt.\n \nThe VIE’s creditors have recourse to \nus for losses on these trade accounts receivable.\n \nAt December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023,\n \ncertain trade \naccounts receivable that can only be used to settle obligations of this VIE\n \nwere $\n241\n \nmillion and $\n284\n \nmillion, \nrespectively, and the liabilities of this VIE where the creditors have recourse to us were $\n150\n \nmillion and $\n210\nmillion, respectively.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFair Value\n \nMeasurements \nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or\n \npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n \nThe fair value hierarchy distinguishes between \n(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained\n \nfrom independent sources (observable \ninputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best \ninformation available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). \nThe fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the\n \nhighest priority to unadjusted quoted prices \nin active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority\n \nto unobservable inputs (Level 3).\n \nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n81 \n \n\n\n \n\n\n•\n \nLevel 1— Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets\n \nor liabilities that are accessible at the \nmeasurement date. \n•\n \nLevel 2— Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are\n \nobservable for the asset or liability, \neither directly or indirectly.\n \nLevel 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities\n \nin active markets; \nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\n \nthat are not active; inputs other than quoted \nprices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are\n \nderived principally from or corroborated by \nobservable market data by correlation or other means. \n•\n \nLevel 3— Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.\nSee \nNote 11 – Fair Value\n \nMeasurements\n \nfor additional information. \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nUse of Estimates \nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with\n \naccounting principles generally accepted in \nthe United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that\n \naffect the reported amounts of assets and \nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\n \nthe financial statements and the reported \namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n \nActual results could differ from those estimates. \nOur consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions\n \nmade by us that affect, among other things, \nour goodwill, long-lived asset and definite-lived intangible asset valuation;\n \ninventory valuation; equity investment \nvaluation; assessment of the annual effective tax rate; valuation of deferred income\n \ntaxes and income tax \ncontingencies; the allowance for credit losses; hedging activity; supplier\n \nrebates; measurement of compensation \ncost for certain share-based performance awards and cash bonus plans; and\n \npension plan assumptions.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFiscal Year \nWe report our results of operations and cash flows on a \n52\n \nor \n53\n \nweeks per fiscal year basis ending on the last \nSaturday of December.\n \nThe year ended December 28, 2024 consisted of \n52\n \nweeks, and the years ended December \n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 consisted of \n52\n \nweeks and \n53\n \nweeks, respectively.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n \nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods\n \nor services in an amount that reflects the \nconsideration that we expect to receive for those goods or services.\n \nTo recognize revenue, we: \n•\n \nidentify the contract(s) with a customer;\n \n•\n \nidentify the performance obligations in the contract;\n \n•\n \ndetermine the transaction price;\n \n•\n \nallocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;\n \nand\n \n•\n \nrecognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. \nWe generate revenue from the sale of dental and medical consumable products, equipment, and services such as \nequipment repair and financial services (Global Distribution and Value-Added Services revenues), company-\nmanufactured specialty products (Global Specialty Products revenue), and software\n \nproducts and related services \n(Global Technology revenues).\n \nProvisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer\n \nreturns and other contra \nrevenue adjustments are included in the transaction price at contract\n \ninception by estimating the most likely amount \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n82 \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nbased upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the\n \nperiod in which the related sales are \nrecognized. \nRevenue derived from the sale of consumable products and company-manufactured\n \nspecialty products is \nrecognized at the point in time when control transfers to the customer, (e.g. when legal title and risks and\n \nrewards \nof ownership transfer to the customer, we have no post-shipment obligations, and we have an enforceable\n \nright to \npayment).\n \nSales of consumable products typically entail high-volume, low-dollar\n \norders shipped using third-party \ncommon carriers.\n \nRevenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when control\n \ntransfers to the customer.\n \nThis occurs \nwhen the equipment is delivered.\n \nSuch sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily\n \nby \nequipment service technicians.\n \nMost equipment requires minimal installation, which is\n \ntypically completed at the \ntime of delivery. \nOur merchandise and equipment products generally carry standard warranty\n \nterms provided by the manufacturer; \nhowever, in instances where we provide a warranty on company-manufactured products or labor services, the \nwarranty costs are accrued in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\n \n(“ASC”) Topic 460 Guarantees.\n \nAt December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we had accrued approximately\n \n$\n8\n \nmillion and $\n12\n \nmillion, \nrespectively, for warranty costs.\n \nRevenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when\n \nproducts are delivered to customers or \nmade available electronically.\n \nSuch software is generally installed by customers and does\n \nnot require extensive \ntraining.\n \nRevenue derived from post-contract customer support for software,\n \nincluding annual support and/or \ntraining, is generally recognized over time using time elapsed as the input method\n \nthat best depicts the transfer of \ncontrol to the customer.\n \nRevenue derived from software sold on a Software-as-a-Service\n \nbasis is recognized ratably \nover the subscription period as control is transferred to the customer. \nRevenue derived from other sources, including freight charges, equipment repairs\n \nand financial services, is \nrecognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when\n \nthe services are provided.\n \nWe apply the \npractical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities performed after\n \nthe customer obtains control as \nfulfillment activities, rather than a separate performance obligation in the\n \ncontract. \nSales, value-add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing\n \nactivities are excluded from \nrevenue. \nSome of our revenue is derived from bundled arrangements that include\n \nmultiple distinct performance obligations, \nwhich are accounted for separately.\n \nWhen we sell software products together with related services (i.e.,\n \ntraining \nand technical support), we allocate the transaction price to each\n \ndistinct performance obligation based on the \nestimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation.\n \nBundled arrangements that include elements \nthat are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related\n \ninstallation service.\n \nWe allocate \nrevenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the goods\n \nor services.\n \nIf an observable selling \nprice is not available (i.e., because we or others do not sell the goods or\n \nservices separately), we use one of the \nfollowing techniques to estimate the standalone selling price: adjusted\n \nmarket approach; cost-plus-margin \napproach; or the residual method.\n \nThere is no specific hierarchy for the use of these methods, but\n \nthe estimated \nselling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable\n \nwould be if it were sold \nregularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure\n \nof our business, technical skill required, \ncustomer location and other market conditions.\nSee \nNote 3 – Net Sales from Contracts with Customers\n \nfor additional disclosures of disaggregated net sales and \nNote 4 – Segment and Geographic Data\n \nfor disclosures of net sales by segment and geographic data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n83 \nSales Returns \nSales returns are recognized as a reduction of revenue by the amount\n \nof expected returns and are recorded as refund \nliability within accrued expenses-other within our consolidated balance sheets.\n \nWe estimate the sales return \nliability based on historical data for specific products, adjusted as necessary\n \nfor new products.\n \nThe allowance for \nreturns is presented gross as a refund liability and we record a right of\n \nreturn asset (and a corresponding adjustment \nto cost of sales) for any products that we expect to be returned and resaleable. \nCost of Sales \nThe primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product\n \n(net of purchase discounts, supplier \nchargebacks and rebates) and inbound and outbound freight charges. \nCosts related to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing,\n \ninternal inventory transfers and other costs of our \ndistribution network are included in selling, general and administrative\n \nexpenses along with other operating costs.\n \nTotal distribution network costs were $\n105\n \nmillion, $\n105\n \nmillion and $\n103\n \nmillion for the years ended December \n28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nSupplier Rebates \n \nSupplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized\n \nover the period they are earned.\n \nThe \nfactors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted\n \ninventory purchases,\n \nsales, supplier \nrebate contract terms, which generally provide for increasing rebates based\n \non either increased purchase or sales \nvolumes.\nDirect Shipping and Handling Costs \nFreight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales.\n \nDirect handling costs, which represent \nprimarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise\n \nprepare, if necessary, merchandise \nfor shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general and administrative\n \nexpenses.\n \nDirect handling costs \nwere $\n106\n \nmillion, $\n98\n \nmillion and $\n96\n \nmillion for the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023\n \nand \nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\nAdvertising and Promotional Costs \nWe expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred.\n \nTotal advertising and promotional expenses were $\n43\nmillion, $\n47\n \nmillion and $\n47\n \nmillion for the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and\n \nDecember \n31, 2022, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation Costs\nWe \nmeasure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated\n \nfair value of the award, and \nrecognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) as compensation expense on\n \na straight-line basis over the requisite \nservice period for time-based restricted stock units and on a graded vesting\n \nbasis for the option awards.\n \nFor \nperformance-based awards, at each reporting date, we reassess whether achievement\n \nof the performance condition \nis probable and accrue compensation expense when achievement of\n \nthe performance condition is probable.\n \nOur \nstock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general and administrative\n \nexpenses.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n84 \nEmployment Benefit Plans and other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nSome of our employees in our international markets participate\n \nin various noncontributory defined benefit plans.\n \nWe recognize the funded status, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected \nbenefit obligation.\n \nEach unfunded plan is recognized as a liability and each funded\n \nplan is recognized as either an \nasset or liability based on its funded status.\n \nWe measure our plan assets and liabilities at the end of our fiscal year. \nNet periodic pension costs and valuations are dependent on assumptions\n \nused by third-party actuaries in calculating \nthose amounts.\n \nThese assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan\n \nassets, rate of future \ncompensation levels, retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors.\n \nWe record the service cost component of \nnet pension cost in selling, general and administrative expenses within\n \nour consolidated statements of income. \nGains and losses that result from changes in actuarial assumptions or\n \nfrom actual experience that differs from \nactuarial assumptions are recognized in and then amortized from Accumulated\n \nother comprehensive income (loss).\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n \nWe consider all highly liquid short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash \nequivalents.\n \nDue to the short-term maturity of such investments,\n \nthe carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of \nfair value.\n \nOutstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit of $\n33\n \nmillion and $\n52\n \nmillion, primarily related to \npayments for inventory, were classified as accounts payable as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023.\n \nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses \nAccounts receivable are generally recognized when revenues are recognized.\n \nIn accordance with the “expected \ncredit loss” model, the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced\n \nby a valuation allowance that reflects our \nbest estimate of the amounts that we do not expect to collect.\n \nIn addition to reviewing delinquent accounts \nreceivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including\n \ntypes of customers and their credit \nworthiness, experience and historical data adjusted for current conditions\n \nand reasonable supportable forecasts.\n \nWe \nrecord allowances for credit losses based upon a specific review of all\n \nsignificant outstanding invoices.\n \nFor \nthose invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates,\n \nbased upon the age of the \nreceivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region\n \nthat the receivable was recorded in, current \neconomic trends and reasonable supportable forecasts.\n \nWe \nwrite off a receivable and charge it against its recorded \nallowance when we deem them uncollectible. \nOur net accounts receivable balance was $\n1,482\n \nmillion, $\n1,863\n \nmillion, and $\n1,442\n \nmillion, at December 28, 2024, \nDecember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. \nThe following table presents our allowances for credit

contract\n \nliabilities \n$ \n89\n$ \n98\n$ \n94\nInventories and Reserves\n \nInventories consist primarily of finished goods,\n \nraw materials and work-in-process and are valued at the lower\n \nof \ncost or net realizable value.\n \nCost is determined by the weighted average method for merchandise and by\n \nactual cost \nfor large equipment and high-tech equipment.\n \nWe manufacture certain of our products for our specialty businesses \n(oral surgery solutions including dental implants, endodontics, and orthopedics).\n \nIn accordance with our policy for \ninventory valuation, we consider many factors including the\n \ncondition and salability of the inventory, historical \nsales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.\n \nFrom time to time, we adjust our assumptions for \nanticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or\n \namortization.\n \nDepreciation is \ncomputed under the straight-line method using estimated useful lives\n \n(See \nNote 7 – Property and Equipment, Net\nfor estimated useful lives).\n \n \n\n\nAmortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line\n \nmethod \nover the lesser of the useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs \nCapitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software\n \nfor internal use and for sale or use by \ncustomers.\n \nFor software to be used solely to meet internal needs, we capitalize\n \ncosts incurred during the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n86 \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\napplication development stage and include such costs within property\n \nand equipment, net within our consolidated \nbalance sheets.\n \nFor software to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, we capitalize\n \nsoftware development \ncosts when technological feasibility is reached, and for cloud-based applications\n \nused to deliver our services we \ncapitalize costs incurred during the application development stage,\n \nand include such costs within investments and \nother within our consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases \n \nWe \ndetermine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception.\n \nAn arrangement contains a lease if it implicitly or \nexplicitly identifies an asset to be used and conveys the right to control\n \nthe use of the identified asset in exchange \nfor consideration.\n \nAs a lessee, we include operating leases in operating lease right-of-use\n \n(“ROU”) assets, \noperating lease liabilities, and non-current operating lease liabilities in our\n \nconsolidated balance sheets.\n \nFinance \nleases are included in property and equipment, current maturities of\n \nlong-term debt, and long-term debt in our \nconsolidated balance sheets.\n \nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease\n \nterm and lease liabilities represent our \nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\n \nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized \nupon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments\n \nover the lease term.\n \nAs most of \nour leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we generally use our incremental\n \nborrowing rate based on the \nestimated rate of interest for fully collateralized and fully amortizing borrowings\n \nover a similar term of the lease \npayments at commencement date to determine the present value of\n \nlease payments.\n \nWhen readily determinable, we \nuse the implicit rate.\n \nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably \ncertain that we will exercise that option.\n \nLease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line\n \nbasis \nover the lease term.\n \nExpenses associated with operating leases and finance leases\n \nare included in selling, general \nand administrative and interest expense, respectively within our consolidated\n \nstatement of income.\n \nShort-term \nleases with a term of 12 months or less are not capitalized. \nWe \nhave lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are\n \ngenerally accounted for as a single \nlease component, except non-lease components for leases of vehicles, which\n \nare accounted for separately.\n \nWhen a \nvehicle lease contains both lease and non-lease components, we allocate the\n \ntransaction price based on the relative \nstandalone selling price.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nWe account for business acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting, under which the net assets of \nacquired businesses are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition\n \ndate and our consolidated financial statements \ninclude the acquired businesses’ results of operations from that date. \nSome prior owners of acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional\n \npurchase price cash consideration, or \nwe may be entitled to recoup a portion of purchase price cash consideration\n \nif certain financial targets are met.\n \nWe \nhave accrued liabilities for the estimated fair value of additional purchase\n \nprice consideration at the time of the \nacquisition, using the income approach, including a probability-weighted\n \ndiscounted cash flow method or an option \npricing method, where applicable.\n \nAny adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded\n \nin selling, general and \nadministrative within our consolidated statements of income.\n \nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value\n \nassets acquired and liabilities assumed at the \nacquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject\n \nto refinement.\n \nAs a result, within \n12 months\nfollowing the date of acquisition, or the measurement period, we\n \nmay record adjustments to the assets acquired and \nliabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill within our consolidated balance\n \nsheets.\n \nAt the end of \nthe measurement period or final determination of the values of such assets\n \nacquired or liabilities assumed, \nwhichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized\n \nin our consolidated statements of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n87 \nGoodwill\n \nAny excess of acquisition consideration over the fair value of identifiable\n \nnet assets acquired is recorded as \ngoodwill.\n \nGoodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits\n \narising from other assets acquired in a \nbusiness combination that are not individually identified and separately\n \nrecognized, such as future customers and \ntechnology, as well as the assembled workforce. \nGoodwill represents, for acquired business, the excess of the purchase price\n \nover the estimated fair value of the net \nassets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible\n \nassets.\n \nGoodwill is subject to impairment \nanalysis annually or more frequently if needed.\n \nSuch impairment analyses for goodwill requires a comparison\n \nof \nthe fair value to the carrying value of reporting units.\n \nWe aggregate operating segments into the reportable \nsegments based on economic similarities, the nature of their products, customer\n \nbasis, and methods of distribution \nas follows: Global Distribution and Value-Added Services; Global Specialty Products;\n \nand Global Technology.\n \nGoodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purpose of\n \npreparing our impairment analyses, based on a \nspecific identification basis. \nDuring the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 28, 2024,\n \nwe revised our segment structure to align \nwith how our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer manages the business, assesses\n \nperformance and allocates \nresources.\n \nOur revised reportable segments now consist of: (i) Global Distribution\n \nand Value\n \n-Added Services; (ii) \nGlobal Specialty Products;\n \nand (iii) Global Technology.\n \nReporting units under the former structure were tested for \nimpairment, and no impairment was identified.\n \nAs a result of the realignment and the change in operating \nsegments, we reallocated goodwill to each of our new reporting units using\n \na relative fair value approach.\n \nBased on \nthe impairment test under the new structure, it was determined that the\n \nfair values of our reporting units more likely \nthan not exceeded their carrying values, resulting in no impairment.\n \nFor both the former and new structure \ngoodwill impairment tests as of September 30, 2024, the fair values of reporting\n \nunits were computed using the \nmethodology described above. \nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including\n \nthe identification of reporting units, \nassignment of assets and liabilities that are considered shared services\n \nto the reporting units, and ultimately the \ndetermination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\n \nThe fair value of each reporting unit is calculated by \napplying the discounted cash flow methodology and confirming with\n \na market approach.\n \nThere are inherent \nuncertainties related to fair value models, the inputs and our judgments\n \nin applying them to this analysis.\n \nThe most \nsignificant inputs include estimation of future cash flows based on budget\n \nexpectations, and determination of \ncomparable companies to develop a weighted average cost of capital for each\n \nreporting unit. \nIn connection with our restructuring initiatives, during the year ended\n \nDecember 28, 2024, we recorded an $\n11\nmillion impairment of goodwill in the Global Specialty Products segment,\n \nrelating to the disposal of a portion of a \nbusiness; such impairment was calculated based on the relative fair value\n \nof goodwill.\n \nFor the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022, we recorded a $\n20\n \nmillion impairment of goodwill, in the Global Specialty Products segment, \nrelating to the disposal of an unprofitable business for which estimated\n \nfair value was lower than carrying value.\nIntangible Assets\nIn connection with our business acquisitions, the major classes of\n \nassets and liabilities to which we generally \nallocate acquisition consideration to, excluding goodwill, include\n \nidentifiable intangible assets (i.e., customer \nrelationships and lists, trademarks and trade names, product development\n \nand non-compete agreements), inventory \nand accounts receivable.\n \nThe estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets\n \nis based on critical judgments \nand assumptions derived from analysis of market conditions, including\n \ndiscount rates, projected revenue growth \nrates (which are based on historical trends and assessment of financial projections),\n \nestimated customer attrition and \nprojected cash flows.\n \nWe have calculated the value of these intangible assets using the multi-period excess \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n88 \n \n\n\n \n\n\nearnings method, the relief-from-royalty method, and the with and without\n \nmethod, where applicable.\n \nThese \nassumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and\n \nmarket conditions. \n \nIntangible assets, other than goodwill, are evaluated for impairment whenever\n \nevents or changes in circumstances \nindicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable\n \nthrough the undiscounted future cash flows \nexpected to be derived from such asset or asset group. \nDefinite and indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete\n \nagreements, trademarks, trade \nnames, customer lists, customer relationships and product development.\n \nFor long-lived assets used in operations, \nimpairment losses are only recorded if the asset or asset groups carrying amount\n \nis not recoverable through its \nundiscounted future cash flows.\n \nWe measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying \namount and the estimated fair value.\n \nWhen an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to\n \nfair value. \nDuring the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023\n \nand December 31, 2022, we recorded total \nimpairment charges within the selling, general and administrative line of our consolidated statements\n \nof income on \nintangible assets of $\n0\n \nmillion, $\n7\n \nmillion and $\n34\n \nmillion, respectively, as more fully discussed in\nNote 9 –\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles, Net\n.\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023\n \nand \nDecember 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges, within the restructuring and\n \nintegration costs line of our \nconsolidated statements of income, of $\n14\n \nmillion, $\n12\n, million, and $\n35\n \nmillion, respectively.\n \nSee \nNote 16 – Plans \nof Restructuring and Integration Costs\n \nfor additional information. \nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred income \ntax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events\n \nthat have been recognized in our \nfinancial statements or tax returns.\n \nIn estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected\n \nfuture \nevents other than expected enactments of changes in tax laws or rates.\n \nThe effect on deferred income tax assets and \nliabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in\n \nthe period that includes the enactment date.\n \nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our 80% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests \nSome minority stockholders in certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have\n \nthe right, at certain times, to require us \nto acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.\n \nTheir interests in these subsidiaries are classified \noutside permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets and are\n \ncarried at the estimated redemption amounts.\n \nThe redemption amounts have been estimated based on recent transactions\n \nand/or implied multiples of earnings \nand, if such earnings and cash flows are not achieved, the value of the\n \nredeemable noncontrolling interests might be \nimpacted.\n \nChanges in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling\n \ninterests subject to put options are \nreflected at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment\n \nto Additional paid-in capital.\n \nFuture reductions \nin the carrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal\n \nto the fair value of the redeemable \nnoncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.\n \nThe recorded value of the redeemable \nnoncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.\n \nAdjustments to the carrying amount of noncontrolling \ninterests to reflect a fair value redemption feature do not impact the\n \ncalculation of earnings per share.\n \nOur net \nincome is reduced by the portion of the subsidiaries’ net income\n \nthat is attributable to redeemable noncontrolling \ninterests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n89 \n \n\n\n \n\n\nNoncontrolling Interests \nNoncontrolling interest represents the ownership interests of certain\n \nminority owners of our consolidated \nsubsidiaries.\n \nOur net income is reduced by the portion of the subsidiaries’\n \nnet income that is attributable to \nnoncontrolling interests.\nComprehensive Income \nComprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting\n \nprinciples generally accepted in the \nUnited States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded\n \ndirectly as an adjustment to \nstockholders’ equity.\n \nOur comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income,\n \nforeign currency \ntranslation gain (loss), unrealized gain (loss) from hedging activities\n \nand unrealized pension adjustment gain.\n \n\n\nRisk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments\n \nWe use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest \nrates, and our unfunded non-qualified supplemental retirement plan (“SERP”)\n \nand our deferred compensation plan \n(“DCP”).\n \nOur objective is to manage the impact that foreign currency\n \nexchange rate fluctuations could have on \nrecognized asset and liability fair values, earnings and cash flows, as well\n \nas our net investments in foreign \nsubsidiaries, the interest rate risk on variable rate debt, and the returns on\n \nour SERP and DCP.\n \nOur risk \nmanagement policy requires that derivative contracts used as hedges be\n \neffective at reducing the risks associated \nwith the exposure being hedged and be designated hedges at inception\n \nof the contracts.\n \nWe do not enter into \nderivative instruments for speculative purposes.\n \nOur derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency \nforward contracts, total return swaps, and interest rate swaps.\n \nForeign currency forward agreements related to forecasted inventory\n \npurchase commitments with foreign suppliers, \nforeign currency swaps related to foreign currency denominated debt, and\n \ninterest rate swaps related to variable rate \ndebt are designated as cash flow hedges.\n \nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges,\n \nthe \nchanges in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded as a\n \ncomponent of Accumulated other comprehensive \nincome in stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into\n \nearnings in the period(s) during which the hedged \ntransactions affect earnings.\n \nWe classify the cash flows related to our hedging activities in the same category in our \nconsolidated statements of cash flows as the cash flows related\n \nto the hedged item. \nForeign currency forward contracts related to our euro-denominated\n \nforeign operations are designated as net \ninvestment hedges.\n \nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as net investment\n \nhedges, changes in the fair \nvalue of the derivatives are recorded in the foreign currency translation gain\n \n(loss) component of Accumulated \nother comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity until the net\n \ninvestment is sold or substantially liquidated. \nInterest swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of hedging\n \nthe cash flow of our variable interest rate term \nloan. \nOur foreign currency forward agreements related to foreign currency\n \nbalance sheet exposure provide economic \nhedges but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. \nFor agreements not designated as hedges, changes in the value of the derivative,\n \nalong with the transaction gain or \nloss on the hedged item, are recorded in other, net, within our consolidated statements of income. \nTotal return swaps are entered into for the purpose of economically hedging our SERP and DCP.\n \nThese swaps are \nexpected to be renewed on an annual basis.\n \nChanges in the fair values of these total return swaps are recorded in \nselling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated\n \nstatements of income and offset recognized \nchanges in the fair values of our SERP and DCP liabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of

Standards\n \nUpdate (“ASU”) 2023-07, “\nSegment \nReporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segments\n” (“Topic 280”),\n \nwhich aims to improve financial \nreporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual\n \nand interim basis for all public \nentities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses.\n \nThe amendments in Topic 280 do \nnot change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates\n \nthose operating segments, or applies \nthe quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments.\n \nWe adopted Topic\n \n280 on a retrospective basis, \nwhich resulted in the required additional disclosures included in our 2024\n \nfiscal year annual consolidated financial \nstatements.\n \nDuring the year ended December 30, 2023, we adopted ASC Topic 848, \n“Reference Rate Reform” (Topic 848): \nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”\n \nwhich provides optional expedients \nand exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and\n \nother transactions affected by the \ndiscontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate or by another reference rate\n \nexpected to be discontinued \nbecause of reference rate reform.\n \nThe adoption of Topic 848 did not have a material impact on our consolidated \nfinancial statements. \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards \nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update \n(“ASU”) 2024-03, “\nIncome Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosure \n(Subtopic 220-40)\n: \nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n,” which requires additional disclosure about the \nspecific expense categories in the notes to financial statements at interim and\n \nannual reporting periods.\n \nThe \namendments in this ASU do not change or remove current expense\n \ndisclosure requirements but affect where this \ninformation appears in the notes to financial statements.\n \nThis ASU is effective for annual reporting periods \nbeginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning\n \nafter December 15, 2027, with early \nadoption permitted.\n \nUpon adoption, the guidance can be applied prospectively or retrospectively.\n \nWe are currently \nevaluating the impact that ASU 2024-03 will have on our consolidated\n \nfinancial statements. \nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, “\nCompensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope \nApplication of Profits Interest and Similar Awards,\n” which clarifies how to determine whether profits interest and \nsimilar awards should be accounted for as a share-based payment arrangement\n \nunder Topic 718 or within the scope \nof other guidance.\n \nThe ASU provides an illustrative example with multiple fact patterns\n \nand amends the structure \nof paragraph 718-10-15-3 of Topic 718 to improve its clarity and operability.\n \nThe guidance in ASU 2024-01 \napplies to all entities that issue profits interest awards as compensation\n \nto employees or nonemployees in exchange \nfor goods or services.\n \nEntities can apply the amendments either retrospectively to\n \nall periods presented in the \nfinancial statements or prospectively to profits interest awards granted\n \nor modified on or after the date of adoption.\n \nIf prospective application is elected, an entity must disclose the nature\n \nof and reason for the change in accounting \nprinciple that resulted from the adoption of the ASU.\n \nThis ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n91 \n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years.\n \nWe do not expect that the requirements of \nASU 2024-01 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial\n \nstatements. \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “\nIncome Taxes (Topic\n \n740): Improvements to Income Tax \nDisclosures\n,” which requires public business entities to disclose additional\n \ninformation in specified categories with \nrespect to the reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory rate for federal, state and\n \nforeign income taxes.\n \nIt also requires greater detail about individual reconciling items in\n \nthe rate reconciliation to the extent the impact of \nthose items exceeds a specified threshold.\n \nIn addition to new disclosures associated with the rate reconciliation,\n \nthe \nASU requires information pertaining to taxes paid (net of refunds received)\n \nto be disaggregated for federal, state, \nand foreign taxes and further disaggregated for specific jurisdictions\n \nto the extent the related amounts exceed a \nquantitative threshold.\n \nThe ASU also describes items that need to be disaggregated\n \nbased on their nature, which is \ndetermined by reference to the item’s fundamental or essential characteristics, such as the transaction or event\n \nthat \ntriggered the establishment of the reconciling item and the activity with which\n \nthe reconciling item is associated.\n \nThe ASU eliminates the historic requirement that entities disclose information\n \nconcerning unrecognized tax \nbenefits having a reasonable possibility of significantly increasing\n \nor decreasing in the 12 months following the \nreporting date.\n \nThis ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.\n \nEarly adoption is \npermitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been\n \nissued or made available for issuance.\n \nThis ASU \nshould be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted.\n \nWe are currently \nevaluating the impact that ASU 2023-09 will have on our consolidated\n \nfinancial statements.\nNote 2 – Cyber Incident\nIn October 2023 Henry Schein experienced a cyber incident that primarily\n \naffected the operations of our North \nAmerican and European dental and medical distribution businesses.\n \nHenry Schein One, our practice management \nsoftware, revenue cycle management and patient relationship management\n \nsolutions business, was not affected, and \nour manufacturing businesses were mostly unaffected.\n \nOn November 22, 2023, we experienced a disruption of our \necommerce platform and related applications, which was remediated. \nDuring the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we had\n \na sales decrease in our dental and \nmedical distribution businesses, which we believe was primarily a\n \nresult of lower sales to episodic customers \nfollowing last year’s cyber incident. \nDuring the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we incurred\n \n$\n9\n \nmillion and $\n11\n \nmillion, \nrespectively, of expenses directly related to the cyber incident, mostly consisting of professional fees.\n \nWe maintain \ncyber insurance, subject to certain retentions and policy limitations.\n \nWith respect to the October 2023 cyber \nincident, we have a $\n60\n \nmillion insurance policy, following a $\n5\n \nmillion retention.\n \nDuring the years ended \nDecember 28, 2024 we received insurance proceeds of $\n40\n \nmillion under this policy representing a partial \ninsurance recovery of losses related to the cyber incident, with the remaining\n \n$\n20\n \nmillion of the claim being under \nreview by our insurance providers.\n \nThe expenses and insurance recoveries related to the cyber\n \nincident are \nincluded in the selling,

the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 28, 2024,\n \nwe revised our reportable segments to align \nwith how the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer manages the business, assesses\n \nperformance and allocates \nresources.\n \nOur revised reportable segments now consist of: (i) Global Distribution\n \nand Value\n \n-Added Services; (ii) \nGlobal Specialty Products; and (iii) Global Technology.\n \nThese segments offer different products and services to \nthe same customer base.\n \nAll prior comparative segment information has been recast\n \nto reflect our new segment \nstructure. \nWe aggregate operating segments into these reportable segments based on economic similarities, the nature of their \nproducts, customer base, and methods of distribution.\n \nGlobal Distribution and Value-Added Services includes \nmerchandise and equipment distribution businesses that serve the global dental\n \nand medical markets; it also \nincludes value-added services such as equipment repair services, financial\n \nservices on a non-recourse basis, \ncontinuing education services for practitioners, consulting and other\n \nservices.\n \nGlobal Distribution and Value-Added Services includes distribution to the global dental and medical markets of \nnational brand and corporate brand merchandise, as well as equipment and related\n \ntechnical services.\n \nThis segment \nalso includes value-added services such as financial services, continuing\n \neducation services, consulting and other \nservices.\n \nThis segment also markets and sells under our own corporate brand,\n \na portfolio of cost-effective, high-\nquality consumable merchandise.\n \nGlobal Specialty Products includes manufacturing, marketing and sales\n \nof dental \nimplant and biomaterial products; and endodontic, orthodontic and orthopedic\n \nproducts and other health care-\nrelated products and services.\n \nGlobal Technology includes development and distribution of practice management \nsoftware, e-services, and other products, which are distributed to health\n \ncare providers. \nOur organizational structure also includes Corporate, which consists primarily of\n \nincome and expenses associated \nwith support functions and projects. \nOur chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is our Chairman\n \nand Chief Executive Officer.\n \nOur CODM uses \nadjusted operating income as the profitability metric for purposes of making\n \ndecisions about allocation of resources \nto each segment and assessing performance of each segment.\n \nAdjusted operating income provides a measure of our \nunderlying segment results that is in line with our approach to risk and performance\n \nmanagement.\n \nWe define \nadjusted operating income as operating income adjusted to exclude\n \n(a) direct cybersecurity costs and related \ninsurance recovery proceeds, (b) impairment of capitalized assets, (c)\n \namortization of acquisition intangibles, (d) \nsettlement and litigation, (e) organizational restructuring expenses, (f) impairment\n \nof intangible assets, (g) changes \nin fair value of contingent consideration, and (h) costs associated with\n \nshareholder advisory matters.\n \nThese \nadjustments are either: (i) non-cash or non-recurring in nature; (ii) not allocable\n \nor controlled by the segment; or \n(iii) not tied to the operational performance of the segment.\n \nAssets by segment are not a measure used to assess the \nperformance of the Company by CODM and thus are not reported in\n \nour disclosures. \nThe accounting policies of the reportable segments are generally\n \nthe same as those described in\nNote 1 – Basis of \n \n\n\nPresentation and Significant Accounting

receivable.\n \nCertain of our notes receivable contain variable interest rates.\n \nWe believe the carrying amounts of the notes \nreceivable are a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the interest rates\n \nin the applicable markets.\n \nOur notes \nreceivable fair value is based on Level 3 inputs within the fair value\n \nhierarchy. \nDebt \nThe fair value of our debt (including bank credit lines, current maturities\n \nof long-term debt and long-term debt) is \nbased on Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, and as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 was \nestimated at $\n2,536\n \nmillion and $\n2,351\n \nmillion, respectively.\n \nFactors that we considered when estimating the fair \nvalue of our debt include market conditions, such as interest rates and credit\n \nspreads. \nDerivative contracts \nDerivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices and\n \nsignificant other observable inputs.\n \nOur derivative \ninstruments primarily include foreign currency forward contracts, interest\n \nrate swaps, and total return swaps. \nThe fair values for the majority of our foreign currency derivative contracts\n \nare obtained by comparing our contract \nrate to a published forward price of the underlying market rates, which\n \nare based on market rates for comparable \ntransactions that are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \nThe fair value of the interest rate swap, which is classified within Level 2\n \nof the fair value hierarchy, is determined \nby comparing our contract rate to a forward market rate as of the\n \nvaluation date. \nThe fair value of total return swaps is determined by valuing the underlying\n \nexchange traded funds of the swap \nusing market-on-close pricing by industry providers as of the valuation\n \ndate that are classified within Level 2 of the \nfair value hierarchy. \nRedeemable noncontrolling interests \nThe values for redeemable noncontrolling interests are based on recent\n \ntransactions and/or implied multiples of \nearnings that are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n \nSee \nNote 20 – Redeemable Noncontrolling \nInterests for additional information\n.\n \n\n\nIntangible Assets \nAssets measured on a non-recurring basis at fair value include intangibles.\n \nInputs for measuring intangibles are \nclassified

instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of credit\n \nrisk.\n \nThese financial instruments \nconsist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables, long-term investments,\n \nnotes receivable and derivative \ninstruments.\n \nIn all cases, our maximum exposure to loss from credit\n \nrisk equals the gross fair value of the financial \ninstruments.\n \nWe routinely maintain cash balances at financial institutions in excess of insured amounts.\n \nWe have \nnot experienced any loss in such accounts and we manage this risk through\n \nmaintaining cash deposits and other \nhighly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions.\n \nWe continuously assess the need for reserves for \nsuch losses, which have been within our expectations.\n \nWe do not require collateral or other security to support \nfinancial instruments subject to credit risk, except for long-term notes receivable. \nWe limit credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and derivative \ninstruments, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions\n \nwho are the counter-parties to such \nfinancial instruments.\n \nAs a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and \nutilizing numerous investment grade counterparties. \nWith respect to our trade receivables, credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively large customer base and\n \nits \ndispersion across different types of health care professionals and geographic areas.\n \nNo single customer accounted \nfor more than \n2\n% of our net sales in each of the years ended December 28, 2024,\n \nDecember 30, 2023 or December \n31, 2022.\n \nWith respect to our sources of supply, our top 10 Global Distribution and Value\n \n-Added Services \nsuppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately \n25\n% and \n4\n%, respectively, of our aggregate \npurchases for the year ended December 28, 2024 and approximately \n24\n% and \n4\n%, respectively, of our aggregate \npurchases for the year ended December 30, 2023. \nOur long-term notes receivable primarily represent strategic financing arrangements\n \nwith certain affiliates.\n \nGenerally, these notes are secured by certain assets of the counterparty; however, in most cases our security is \nsubordinate to the rights of other commercial financial institutions.\n \nWhile we have exposure to credit loss in the \nevent of non-performance by these counterparties, we conduct ongoing assessments\n \nof their financial and \noperational performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per

changes to the credit risk of the derivative counterparties.\n \nWe attempt to minimize these risks using \nforeign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counter-party credit limits.\n \nOur hedging activities provide \nonly limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks.\n \nFactors that could influence the effectiveness of \nour hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging\n \ninstruments and liquidity of the credit \nmarkets.\n \nAll foreign currency forward contracts that we enter are for the sole\n \npurpose of hedging an existing or \nanticipated currency exposure.\n \nWe do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative purposes \nand we manage our credit risks by diversifying our counterparties,\n \nmaintaining a strong balance sheet and having \nmultiple sources of capital.\n \nOur derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency forward contracts,\n \ntotal \nreturn swaps, and interest rate swaps. \nDuring 2019 we entered foreign currency forward contracts that we designated\n \nas net investment hedges to hedge a \nportion of our euro-denominated foreign operations.\n \nThese net investment hedges offset changes in the U.S. dollar \nvalue of our investments in certain euro-functional currency subsidiaries due\n \nto fluctuating foreign exchange rates.\n \nGains and losses related to these net investment hedges are recorded\n \nin accumulated other comprehensive loss \nwithin our consolidated balance sheets.\n \nAmounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\n \nincluded \nin interest expense within our consolidated statements of income.\n \nThe aggregate notional value of these net \ninvestment hedges, which matured on \nNovember 16, 2023\n, was approximately €\n200\n \nmillion.\n \nOn November 3, \n2023 we entered into new foreign currency forward contracts to\n \nhedge a portion of our euro-denominated foreign \noperations which are designated as net investment hedges.\n \nThe aggregate notional value of this net investment \nhedge, which matures on \nNovember 3, 2028\n, is approximately €\n300\n \nmillion.\n \nDuring the years ended December 28, \n2024, December 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we recorded an\n \nincrease/(decrease) of $\n10\n \nmillion, $(\n32\n) \nmillion, and $\n9\n \nmillion, respectively, within other comprehensive income related to these foreign currency forward \ncontracts.\n \nSee \nNote 11 – Fair Value\n \nMeasurements\n \nfor additional information. \n \n\n\nOn \nMarch 20, 2020\n, we entered a total return swap to economically hedge our unfunded\n \nnon-qualified SERP and \nour DCP.\n \nThis swap will offset changes in our SERP and DCP liabilities.\n \nAt the swap’s inception, the notional \nvalue of the investments in these plans was $\n43\n \nmillion.\n \nAt December 28, 2024, the notional value of the \ninvestments in these plans was $\n106\n \nmillion.\n \nAt December 28, 2024, the financing blended rate for this swap\n \nwas \nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) of \n4.53\n% plus \n0.61\n%, for a combined rate of \n5.14\n%.\n \nFor \nthe years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023,\n \nand December 31, 2022,\n \nwe recorded within selling, \ngeneral and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income,\n \na gain (loss) of $\n8\n \nmillion, \n10\nmillion, and $(\n17\n) million, respectively, net of transaction costs, related to this undesignated swap.\n \nSee \nNote 19 –\nEmployee Benefit Plans\n \nfor additional information. \nOn July 11, 2023, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flow of our variable\n \nrate $\n750\nmillion floating debt term loan facility, with \nthree years\n \nmaturity, effectively changing the floating rate portion of \nour obligation to a fixed rate.\n \nUnder the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we receive variable\n \ninterest \npayments based on the one-month Term SOFR rate and pay interest at a fixed rate.\n \nAs of December 28, 2024, the \nnotional value of the interest rate swap agreements was $\n713\n \nmillion.\n \nFor the years ended December 28, 2024 and \nDecember 30, 2023, we recorded, within accumulated other comprehensive\n \nloss within our consolidated balance \nsheets, a loss of $\n3\n \nmillion and $\n10\n \nmillion, respectively, related to the change in the fair value of these interest rate \nswap agreements, since we have designated these swaps agreements as cash flow\n \nhedges. \nFluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies as compared\n \nto the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively \naffect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and retained earnings, all of which are expressed\n \nin U.S. \ndollars.\n \nWhere we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily\n \nforeign currency forward \ncontracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange\n \nrate fluctuations on earnings.\n \nWe purchase \nshort-term (i.e., generally 18 months or less) foreign currency forward

agreement (the “Term Credit \nAgreement”).\n \nThe interest rate on this term loan is based on the \nTerm SOFR\n \nplus a spread based on our leverage \nratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter.\n \nThis term loan matures on \nJuly 11, 2026\n.\n \nWe are required to \nmake quarterly payments of $\n9\n \nmillion from September 2024 through June 2026, with the remaining\n \nbalance due in \nJuly 2026.\n \nPreviously, we had been required to make quarterly payments of $\n5\n \nmillion from September 2023 \nthrough June 2024.\n \nAs of December 28, 2024, the borrowings outstanding under\n \nthis term loan were $\n712\n \nmillion.\n \nAt December 28, 2024, the interest rate under the Term Credit Agreement was \n4.45\n% plus \n1.60\n% for a combined \nrate of \n6.05\n%.\n \nAs of December 30, 2023, the borrowings outstanding under\n \nthis term loan were $\n741\n \nmillion.\n \nAt \nDecember 30, 2023, the interest rate under the Term Credit Agreement was \n5.36\n% plus \n1.35\n% for a combined rate \nof \n6.71\n%.\n \nHowever, we have a hedge in place that ultimately creates an effective fixed rate of \n6.04\n% and \n5.79\n% at \nDecember 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.\n \nThe Term Credit Agreement requires, among other \nthings, that we maintain certain maximum leverage ratios.\n \nAdditionally, the Term\n \nCredit Agreement contains \ncustomary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants as well as customary\n \nnegative covenants, subject \nto negotiated exceptions, on liens, indebtedness, significant corporate changes\n \n(including mergers), dispositions and \ncertain restrictive agreements.\nU.S. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization \nWe have a facility agreement based on our U.S. trade accounts receivable that is structured as an asset-backed \nsecuritization program with pricing committed for up to \nthree years\n.\n \nOn December 6, 2024, we extended the \nexpiration date of this facility agreement to \nDecember 6, 2027\n \n(the previous maturity date was \nDecember 15, 2025\n).\n \nThis facility agreement has a purchase limit of $\n450\n \nmillion with two banks as agents. \nAs of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the borrowings outstanding\n \nunder this securitization facility \nwere $\n150\n \nmillion and $\n210\n \nmillion, respectively.\n \nAt December 28, 2024, the interest rate on borrowings under \nthis facility was based on the \nasset-backed commercial paper rate\n \nof \n4.73\n% plus \n0.75\n%, for a combined rate of \n5.48\n%.\n \nAt December 30, 2023, the interest rate on borrowings under\n \nthis facility was based on the asset-backed \ncommercial paper rate of \n5.67\n% plus \n0.75\n%, for a combined rate of \n6.42\n%. \nIf our accounts receivable collection pattern changes due to customers\n \neither paying late or not making payments, \nour ability to borrow under this facility may be reduced. \nWe are required to pay a commitment fee of \n30\n \nto \n35\n \nbasis points depending upon program utilization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN,

2022, our effective tax rate was \n23.5\n%.\n \nThe difference between our effective tax rate and the federal \nstatutory tax rate is primarily due to state and foreign income taxes\n \nand interest expense.\n \nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which requires U.S. companies to \npay a mandatory one-time transition tax on historical offshore earnings that have not\n \nbeen repatriated to the U.S.\n \nThe transition tax is payable over eight years.\n \nWithin our consolidated balance sheets, transition tax of $\n24\n \nmillion \nand $\n11\n \nmillion were included in accrued taxes for 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $\n24\n \nmillion was included in \nother liabilities for 2023. \nDue to the one-time transition tax and the imposition of the GILTI provisions, all previously unremitted earnings \nwill no longer be subject to U.S. federal income tax; however, there could be U.S., state and/or foreign withholding \ntaxes upon distribution of such unremitted earnings.\n \nDetermination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax \nliability with respect to such earnings is not practicable. \nThe Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) issued\n \ntechnical and administrative \nguidance on Pillar Two rules in December 2021, which provides for a global minimum tax rate on the earnings of \nlarge multinational businesses on a country-by-country basis.\n \nEffective January 1, 2024, the minimum global tax \nrate is 15% for various jurisdictions pursuant to the Pillar Two rules.\n \nFuture tax reform resulting from these \ndevelopments may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which\n \nmay adversely impact our effective tax \nrate going forward or result in higher cash tax liabilities.\n \nAs of December 28, 2024, the impact of the Pillar Two \nrules to our financial statements was immaterial. \nASC Topic 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with other \nprovisions contained within its guidance.\n \nThis topic prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement\n \nattribute \nfor the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or\n \nexpected to be taken in a tax \nreturn.\n \nFor those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be\n \nmore likely than not to be sustained upon \nexamination by the taxing authorities.\n \nThe amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has \na greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement.\n \nIn the normal course of business, \nour tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities.\n \nSuch examinations may result in future tax \nand interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain tax positions\n \ntaken in respect of certain tax \nmatters. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial

which are included in “other\n \nliabilities” within our consolidated \nbalance sheets, as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 was $\n108\n \nmillion and $\n115\n \nmillion, respectively, \nof which $\n100\n \nmillion and $\n107\n \nmillion, respectively, would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.\n \nIt is \npossible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12\n \nmonths, which may result in a \nmaterial impact on our consolidated statements of income. \nAll tax returns audited by the IRS are officially closed through 2020.\n \nThe tax years subject to examination by the \nIRS include years 2021 and forward.\n \nIn addition, limited positions reported in the 2017 tax year are subject\n \nto IRS \nexamination. \nThe amount of tax interest expense

$\n4\n \nmillion, $\n0\n \nmillion, $\n0\n \nmillion, $\n0\nmillion, and $\n0\n \nmillion, respectively.\n \nWe also have lifetime consulting agreements that provide for current \ncompensation of \nfour-hundred thousand\n \ndollars per year, with small scheduled increases every fifth year with the \nnext increase in 2027.\n \nIn addition, some agreements have provisions for additional\n \nincentives and compensation.\n \n \n\n\nLegal Proceedings\nHenry Schein, Inc. has been named as a defendant in multiple opioid\n \nrelated lawsuits (currently less than one-\nhundred and seventy-five (\n175\n); one or more of Henry Schein, Inc.’s subsidiaries is also named as a defendant in a \nnumber of those cases).\n \nGenerally, the lawsuits allege that the manufacturers of prescription opioid drugs engaged \nin a false advertising campaign to expand the market for such drugs and\n \ntheir own market share and that the entities \nin the supply chain (including Henry Schein, Inc. and its subsidiaries) reaped\n \nfinancial rewards by refusing or \notherwise failing to monitor appropriately and restrict the improper distribution\n \nof those drugs.\n \nThese actions \nconsist of some that have been consolidated within the MultiDistrict Litigation\n \n(“MDL”) proceeding In Re National \nPrescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804; Case No. 17-md-2804)\n \nand are currently stayed, and others which \nremain pending in state courts and are proceeding independently and outside\n \nof the MDL.\n \nOn January 29, 2025, \nthe court granted our motion for summary judgment in the action\n \nfiled by Mobile County Board of Health, et al. in \nAlabama state court and dismissed all claims against Henry Schein\n \nwith prejudice.\n \nWe have settled the action filed \nby DCH Health Care Authority, et al. in Alabama state court (\nthirty-four\n \nplaintiffs) for an immaterial amount and \nthe claims against Henry Schein have been dismissed with prejudice.\n \nWe have also settled \nforty-four\n \ncases (plus \none\n \ncase in which we were not yet named a defendant) filed by plaintiffs represented\n \nby the Napoli Shkolnik PLLC \nlaw firm for an immaterial amount.\n \nStipulations of Discontinuance with Prejudice in those cases\n \nare pending.\n \nAt \nthis time, the following case is set for trial: the action filed by Florida Health Sciences\n \nCenter, Inc. (and \n25\nother \nhospitals located throughout the State of Florida) in Florida state court,\n \nwhich is currently scheduled for a jury trial \nin September 2025.\n \nOf Henry Schein’s 2024 net sales of approximately $\n12.7\n \nbillion, sales of opioids represented \nless than \nfour\n-tenths of 1 percent.\n \nOpioids represent a negligible part of our business.\n \nWe intend to defend \nourselves vigorously against these actions. \nOn January 18, 2024, a putative class action was filed against the Company\n \nin the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of New York (“EDNY”), Case No. 24-cv-387 (the “Cruz-Bermudez Action”), based on the \nOctober 2023 cyber incident described in\nNote 3 – Cyber Incident\n.\n \n \n\n\nOn January 26, 2024, a second putative class

Depperschmidt Action was voluntarily dismissed\n \nwithout \nprejudice.\n \nOn February 16, 2024, an amended complaint was filed in\n \nthe Cruz-Bermudez Action with additional \nplaintiffs’ counsel from the Depperschmidt Action and an additional new plaintiff.\n \n \nPlaintiffs in the Cruz-Bermudez Action seek to represent a class of all individuals\n \nwhose personally identifying \ninformation and personal health information was compromised by\n \nthe incident.\n \nPlaintiffs generally claim to have \nbeen harmed by alleged actions and/or omissions by the Company\n \nin connection with the incident and that the \nCompany made deceptive public statements regarding privacy and data protection.\n \nPlaintiffs assert a variety of \nclaims seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys’\n \nfees, and other related relief.\n \nOn March \n22, 2024, plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew two of their five causes of action.\n \nOn April 8, 2024, the court denied the \nCompany’s motion to dismiss the remaining claims. \nOn June 6, 2024, plaintiffs and the Company informed the court that they had agreed\n \nto a term sheet for a class \naction settlement of the Cruz-Bermudez Action.\n \nPlaintiffs and the Company entered into a class action settlement \nagreement on September 13, 2024, and the court preliminarily approved\n \nthe settlement on September 16, \n2024.\n \nUnder the terms of the settlement, all claims in the Cruz-Bermudez\n \nAction will be dismissed, the Cruz-\nBermudez Action will be terminated, the Company will receive a\n \nrelease of claims from the class, and the \nCompany will pay $\n2.9\n \nmillion into a fund for class members.\n \nThe court has approved the settlement and entered \nthe final approval order on February 20, 2025.\n \nThe settlement agreement’s effective date is \n35 days\n \nafter the final \napproval order assuming no appeals have been filed. \nFrom time to time, we may become a party to other legal proceedings,\n \nincluding, without limitation, product \nliability claims, employment matters, commercial disputes, governmental\n \ninquiries and investigations (which may \nin some cases involve our entering into settlement arrangements or consent\n \ndecrees), and other matters arising out \nof the ordinary course of our business.\n \nWhile the results of any legal proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty, \nin our opinion none of these other pending matters are currently\n \nanticipated to have a material adverse effect on our \nconsolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. \nAs of December 28, 2024, we had accrued our best estimate of potential\n \nlosses relating to claims that were probable \nto result in liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate\n \na loss.\n \nThis accrued amount, as well as \nrelated expenses, was not material to our financial position, results of operations\n \nor cash flows.\n \nOur method for \ndetermining estimated losses considers currently available\n \nfacts, presently enacted laws and regulations and other \nfactors, including probable recoveries from third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n126 \nNote 18 – Stock-Based Compensation\n \nStock-based awards are provided to certain employees under our 2024 Stock Incentive\n \nPlan (formerly known as our \n2020 Stock Incentive Plan) and to non-employee directors under our 2023 Non-Employee\n \nDirector Stock Incentive \nPlan (together, the “Plans”).\n \nThe Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board\n \n(the \n“Compensation Committee”).\n \nHistorically, equity-based awards to our employees have been granted solely in the \nform of time-based and performance-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”)\n \nwith the exception of our 2021 plan year \nin which non-qualified stock options were issued in place of performance-based\n \nRSUs and in 2022, when we \ngranted time-based and performance-based RSUs, as well as non-qualified\n \nstock options.\n \nStarting with our 2023 \nplan year, we returned to granting our employees equity-based awards solely in the form of\n \ntime-based and \nperformance-based RSUs.\n \nOur non-employee directors receive equity-based awards solely in the form\n \nof time-\nbased RSUs. \nAs of December 28, 2024, there were \n75,742,657\n \nshares authorized and \n9,973,475\n \nshares available to be granted \nunder the 2024 Stock Incentive Plan and \n2,075,000\n \nshares authorized and \n361,724\n \nshares available to be granted \nunder the 2023 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan.\nRSUs are stock-based awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions.\n \nIn the case of RSUs, common \nstock is delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions.\n \nWe issue RSUs to employees that primarily \nvest (i) solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time, primarily with \nfour\n-year cliff vesting and/or (ii) \nbased on achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time, primarily \nwith \nthree\n-year cliff vesting.\n \nRSUs granted to our non-employee directors primarily include \n12\n-month cliff vesting.\n \nFor these RSUs, we recognize the cost as compensation expense on a straight-line\n \nbasis. \nFor all RSUs, we estimate the fair value based on our closing stock\n \nprice on the grant date.\n \nWith respect to \nperformance-based RSUs, the number of shares that ultimately vest and\n \nare received by the recipient is based upon \nour performance as measured against specified targets over a specified period, as\n \ndetermined by the Compensation \nCommittee.\n \nAlthough there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we\n \nestimate the fair value of \nperformance-based RSUs based on our closing stock price at time of grant. \nEach of the Plans provide for certain adjustments to the performance measurement\n \nin connection with awards under \nthe Plans.\n \nWith respect to the performance-based RSUs granted under our 2024 Stock Incentive Plan, such \nperformance measurement adjustments relate to significant events, including,\n \nwithout limitation, acquisitions, \ndivestitures, new business ventures, certain capital transactions (including share\n \nrepurchases), differences in \nbudgeted average outstanding shares (other than those resulting from capital\n \ntransactions referred to above), \nrestructuring costs, if any, amortization expense recorded for acquisition-related intangible assets (solely with \nrespect to performance-based RSUs granted in the 2023 and 2024 plan years),\n \ncertain litigation settlements or \npayments, if any, changes in accounting principles or in applicable laws or regulations, changes in income tax rates \nin certain markets, foreign exchange fluctuations, the financial impact\n \neither positive or negative, of the difference \nin projected earnings generated by COVID-19 test kits (solely with respect\n \nto performance-based RSUs granted in \nthe 2022 and 2023 plan years) and impairment charges (solely with respect to performance-based\n \nRSUs granted in \nthe 2023 and 2024 plan years), and unforeseen events or circumstances\n \naffecting us. \nOver the performance period, the number of RSUs that will ultimately vest\n \nand be issued and the related \ncompensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our\n \nestimation of achieving such performance \ntargets.\n \nThe ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation\n \ncost recognized as an \nexpense is based on our actual performance against the pre-determined performance\n \nmetrics (in each case as \nadjusted). \nStock options are awards that allow the recipient to purchase shares of our\n \ncommon stock after vesting at a fixed \nprice set at the time of grant.\n \nStock options were granted at an exercise price equal to our\n \nclosing stock price on the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS

\nduring the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December\n \n31, 2022, respectively.\n \nWe \nrecord deferred income tax assets for awards that will result in\n \nfuture income tax deductions based on the \namount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax rate in the\n \njurisdiction in which we will receive a \ndeduction. \nOur consolidated statements of cash flows present our stock-based compensation\n \nexpense as a reconciling \nadjustment between net income and net cash provided by operating\n \nactivities for all periods presented.\n \nThere were \nno cash

TO CONSOLIDATED\n \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n(in millions, except share and per share data) \n135 \nNote 24 – Related Party Transactions\n \nIn connection with the formation of Henry Schein One, LLC, our joint venture\n \nwith Internet Brands, which was \nformed on July 1, 2018, we entered into a \nten-year\n \nroyalty agreement with Internet Brands whereby we will pay \nInternet Brands approximately $\n31\n \nmillion annually for the use of their intellectual property.\n \nDuring the years \nended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we recorded\n \n$\n31\n \nmillion, $\n31\n \nmillion and \n$\n31\n \nmillion, respectively, within selling, general and administrative in our consolidated statements of income, in \nconnection with costs related to this royalty agreement.\n \nAs of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, Henry \nSchein One, LLC had a net payable balance to Internet Brands of $\n1\n \nmillion and $\n1\n \nmillion, respectively, \ncomprised of amounts related to results of operations and the royalty agreement.\n \nThe components of this payable \nare recorded within accrued expenses: other within our consolidated balance sheets. \nWe \nhave interests in entities that we account for under the equity accounting\n \nmethod.\n \nIn our normal course of \nbusiness, during the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023\n \nand December 31, 2022, we recorded net \nsales of $\n52\n \nmillion, $\n47\n \nmillion, and $\n46\n \nmillion respectively, to such entities.\n \nDuring the years ended December \n28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we purchased\n \n$\n11\n \nmillion, $\n10\n \nmillion and $\n9\n \nmillion \nrespectively, from such entities.\n \nAt December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we had an aggregate\n \n$\n31\n \nmillion \nand $\n32\n \nmillion, respectively, due from our equity affiliates, and $\n6\n \nmillion and $\n5\n \nmillion, respectively, due to our \nequity affiliates. \nCertain of our facilities related to our acquisitions are leased from employees\n \nand minority shareholders.\n \nPlease see \nNote 8 – Leases\n \nfor further information. \nNote 25 – Subsequent Event\nOn January 29, 2025, Henry Schein, Inc. announced a strategic investment\n \nby funds affiliated with KKR, a leading \nglobal investment firm.\n \nIn addition to KKR’s current holdings, KKR will make an additional $\n250\n \nmillion \ninvestment in the Company’s common stock.\n \nAs a result, KKR will own approximately \n12\n% of the Company’s \nstock.\n \nKKR will also have the ability to purchase additional shares via\n \nopen market purchases up to a total equity \nstake of \n14.9\n% of the outstanding common shares of the Company.\n \nIn addition, under the agreement \nbetween Henry Schein and KKR, \ntwo\n \nindependent directors will join our Board of Directors.\n \nUpon consummation \nof this strategic investment,\n \nwe will issue new shares of common stock to funds affiliated with KKR for an \ninvestment of $\n250\n \nmillion, at approximately $\n76.10\n \nper share.\n \nAs part of the agreement, KKR has also agreed to \ncustomary voting and other provisions.\n \nConsummation of these transactions is subject to customary closing \nconditions, including the expiration or termination of any waiting\n \nperiod under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and \ncertain foreign regulatory approvals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n136 \nITEM 9.\n \nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and\n \nFinancial Disclosure \nNone. \nITEM 9A.\n \nControls and Procedures \nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including\n \nour principal executive officer and \nprincipal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and \nprocedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report as such\n \nterm is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and \n15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\n \nas amended (the “Exchange Act”).\n \nBased on \nthis evaluation, our management, including our principal executive\n \nofficer and principal financial officer, \nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 28, 2024,\n \nto ensure that all \nmaterial information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file\n \nor submit under the Exchange Act is \naccumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely\n \ndecisions regarding required disclosure and \nthat all such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported\n \nwithin the time periods specified in the \nSEC’s rules and forms, and the rules of the Nasdaq stock exchange. \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nThe combination of continued acquisition integrations and systems\n \nimplementation activity undertaken during the \nquarter and carried over from prior quarters, when considered in\n \nthe aggregate, represents a material change in our \ninternal control over financial reporting.\n \nAs previously reported, the full integration of TriMed Inc. (“TriMed”) \nwill extend beyond year-end and, therefore, we excluded TriMed, which represents less than 0.5% of our total\n \nnet \nsales, from our annual assessment of internal control over financial\n \nreporting as of December 28, 2024,\n \nas permitted \nby related SEC staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses. \nDuring the quarter ended December 28, 2024,\n \npost-acquisition integration related activities continued for our\n \ndental \nand medical businesses acquired during prior quarters.\n \nThese acquisitions, the majority of which utilize separate \ninformation and financial accounting systems, have been included\n \nin our consolidated financial statements since \ntheir respective dates of acquisition.\n \nAlso, during the quarter ended December 28, 2024, we completed the systems\n \nimplementation activities for \nimplementing a new e-commerce system for our dental and medical\n \nbusinesses in the UK.\n \nFinally, we continued \nsystems implementation activities for our dental business in France and\n \nIreland. \nAll acquisitions, continued acquisition integrations and systems implementation\n \nactivities involve necessary and \nappropriate change-management controls that are considered in our quarterly\n \nassessment of the design and \noperating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. \nThe deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting identified\n \nas of December 30, 2023 at the application \ncontrol level related to logical and user access management and segregation\n \nof duties have continued to be the \nsubject of ongoing remediation, including implementation of specific\n \naction plans and the testing/validation of \ncontrol operating effectiveness, which were substantially completed as of our year-end on December\n \n28, 2024. \nManagement’s\n \nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate\n \ninternal control over financial reporting, \nas such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).\n \nOur internal control system is designed to provide \nreasonable assurance to our management and Board regarding the preparation\n \nand fair presentation of published \nfinancial statements.\n \nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management,\n \nincluding our principal \nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal \ncontrol over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated\n \nFramework (2013), updated \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n137 \nand reissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, or the COSO Framework.\n \nBased on our evaluation \nunder the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our\n \ninternal control over financial reporting was \neffective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 28, 2024. \nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28,\n \n2024, has been independently \naudited by BDO USA, P.C., an independent registered public accounting firm and their attestation is included \nherein. \nLimitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control\n \nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\n \nreasonable, not absolute, assurance \nthat the objectives of the internal control system are met.\n \nBecause of the inherent limitations of any internal control \nsystem, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that\n \nall control issues, if any, within a company \nhave been detected. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndex to
