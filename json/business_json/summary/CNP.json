  "item1_summary": " Indiana Electric received approval from the IURC for a CPCN seeking approval to construct two natural gas combustion turbines to replace portions of its existing coal-fired generation fleet . The turbines are targeted to be operational by mid-year 2025 . Houston Electric is leasing TEEEF that can aid in restoring power to customers during certain significant power outages that are impacting its distribution system .\n As of December 31, 2024, Houston Electric leased 505 MW of TEEEF . Houston Electric did not receive revenue or profit from ERCOT and would not charge Houston-area customers for these units . A substation is a facility that transforms electricity from a higher voltage to a lower voltage or vice versa . Service centers consist of office buildings, warehouses and repair facilities that are used in transmitting and distributing electricity .\n CenterPoint Energy and CERC’s Natural Gas mains are located in Indiana and Ohio except for pipeline facilities extending from points in northern Kentucky to points in southern Indiana so that gas may be transported to Indiana and sold or transported to customers in Indiana . With a few exceptions, the measuring stations at which Center point Energy’�s and Cerc. receive gas are owned, operated and maintained by others .\n As of December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, through CEIP, owned and operated over 219 miles of intrastate pipeline in Louisiana and Texas . The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025 . For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements .\n CenterPoint Energy’s common stock is listed on the NYSE and NYSE Chicago and is traded under the symbol “CNP.” The amount of future cash dividends will be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors . Houston Electric, LLC and CERC Corp. held by Utility Holding, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint .\n Houston Electric, LLC and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. are collectively referred to as the Registrants . Houston Electric provides electric transmission service to transmission service customers in the ERCOT region and distribution service to REPs serving the Texas Gulf Coast area that includes the city of Houston . CERC Corp. is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the company .\n CenterPoint Energy is first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these regulated segments . The Electric reportable segment includes electric transmission and distribution services that are subject to rate regulation in Houston Electric's and Indiana Electric’s service territories . The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025 .\n Houston Electric and CERC each consist of a single reportable segment . The corporate and Other segment includes (i) energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services by Energy Systems Group through June 30, 2023, the date of the sale of CenterPoint Energy . We expect our businesses to continue to be affected by the key factors and trends discussed below .\n The majority of our revenues are generated from the transmission and delivery of electricity and the sale of natural gas by our subsidiaries . Our focus continues to be on the growth of our regulated utility businesses including our electric and gas utility operations, which comprise over 95% of our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024 .\n A reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets . Disruptions in the financial markets along with high or rising interest rates can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive .\n 80% of CenterPoint Energy’s projected consolidated investments are expected to be recovered through interim capital recovery trackers or rate cases based on a forward test year . The outcome of these base rate proceedings is uncertain and may be impacted by the current economic environment . Indiana Electric filed a rate case during 2023, and Houston Electric and CERC’�s Ohio jurisdiction filed rate cases in 2024 .\n CenterPoint Energy and CERC have weather normalization or other rate mechanisms that largely mitigate the impact of weather on Natural Gas in Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Minnesota and Ohio . Each state has a unique economy and is driven by different industrial sectors . Some industries are driven by population growth like education and health care, while others may be influenced by strength in the nationa\n Adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment and increased availability of alternate energy sources, may cause consumers to use less energy . Long-term national trends indicate residential customers have reduced their energy consumption, which could adversely affect our results . Management expects residential meter growth for Houston Electric to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 2%. Management additionally anticipates significant increased electric load growth demand in our Houston Electric service territory .\n Global supply chain has experienced significant disruptions due to a multitude of factors, such as geopolitical and economic uncertainty, regulatory and political instability, import tariffs and trade agreements . These disruptions have adversely impacted the utility industry . President Trump has expressed a desire to impose substantial new or increased tariffs, and in February 2025, imposed tariffs on several countries and certain imports into the United States .\n CenterPoint Energy is the first combined electric and natural gas utility with regulated generation assets to adopt net zero for its Scope 1 and certain Scope 2 emissions by 2035 goals . In addition, we set a Scope 3 emission reduction goal across our multi-state footprint by committing to help our residential and commercial customers reduce GHG emissions attributable to their end use of natural gas by 20%."
