If any of such events should occur, the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of APA’s securities could lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently considers immaterial may also adversely affect the Company.\nRISKS RELATED TO PRICING, DEMAND, AND PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND NGLs\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices and their volatility could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and the price of APA’s common stock.\nThe Company’s revenues, operating results, future rate of growth, and carrying value of its oil and gas properties depend highly upon the prices it receives for its sales of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL products. Historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2024 ranged from a high of $87.69 per barrel to a low of $66.73 per barrel, and the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2024 ranged from a high of $13.20 per MMBtu to a low of $1.21 per MMBtu. The market prices for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs depend on factors beyond the Company’s control. These factors include demand, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:\n•\nworldwide and domestic supplies and/or inventories of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs and the availability of related pipeline, transportation, import/export, and refining capacity and infrastructure;\n•\nactions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC members that participate in OPEC initiatives (OPEC+);\n•\npolitical conditions and events in oil and gas producing regions, including instabilities, changes in governments, or armed conflicts, such as the Russian war in Ukraine and the armed conflict in Israel and Gaza;\n•\nthe price, competitiveness, decision to use, and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources, including coal, biofuels, and renewables;\n•\nincreased competitiveness of, and demand for, alternative energy sources;\n•\ntechnological advances affecting energy supply and energy consumption, including those that alter fuel choices;\n•\nthe availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;\n•\nthe availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;\n•\nweather conditions;\n•\nthe impact of political pressure and the influence of environmental groups, investors, and other stakeholders on decisions and policies related to the oil and gas industry, including with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters;\n•\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including changes or initiatives to address the impacts of global climate change, hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, flaring, or water disposal; and\n•\nthe overall economic environment, including rates of growth, trade tensions, and increasing inflationary pressure.\nLow prices have previously adversely affected and could from time to time in the future adversely affect the Company’s revenues, operating income, cash flow, and proved reserves, and a prolonged period of low prices could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows and limit its ability to fund capital expenditures. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, the Company would be unable to replace reserves and production. Sustained low prices of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs could also further adversely impact the Company’s business, including by weakening the Company’s financial condition and reducing its liquidity, limiting the Company’s ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations, causing the Company to delay or postpone some of its capital projects or reallocate capital to different projects or regions, limiting the Company’s access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt, or reducing the carrying value of the Company’s oil and gas properties, resulting in additional non-cash impairments.\n19\nThe Company’s ability to sell crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs, receive market prices for these commodities, and/or meet volume commitments under transportation services agreements may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints, the inability to procure and resell volumes economically, and various transportation interruptions.\nA portion of the Company’s crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production in any region may be, and previously have been, interrupted, limited, or shut in from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, cyberattacks or terrorist events, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport the Company’s production. Additionally, the Company has previously and may in the future voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions, such as weak or negative prices. If a substantial amount of the Company’s production is interrupted or curtailed at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect the Company’s cash flows. Further, if the Company is unable to procure and resell third-party volumes at or above a net price that covers the cost of transportation, the Company’s cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company has previously not realized, and may in the future not realize, an adequate return on wells that it drills.\nDrilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including that the Company may not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs or may not recover all or any portion of its investment in the wells it drills. Management has previously determined, and may in the future determine, that future drilling or development activities will not, or are unlikely to, occur for a well or reservoir, based on drilling results, current or future estimated commodity prices or demand for oil, natural gas, and NGLs, or other information. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations are subject to a variety of risks, including unexpected drilling conditions (such as pressure or formation irregularities), equipment failures or accidents, catastrophic events, marine risks, adverse weather conditions, and increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs, equipment, and labor. In addition, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Any such events could have an adverse effect on the Company’s future results of operations and financial condition. Exploration costs and dry hole expenses incurred by the Company during the reporting period are further discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and reflected in the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nThe Company’s commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent it from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose it to other risks.\nTo the extent that the Company engages in price risk management activities to protect itself from commodity price declines, the Company may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases. The Company’s hedging arrangements may expose it to the risk of financial loss, including when production falls short of the hedged volumes, price-basis differentials widen, a hedging counterparty defaults, or an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices.\nGlobal pandemics have previously, may continue to, and may in the future adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations; the global economy; the demand for and prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs; and the performance of the Company’s workforce.\nGlobal pandemics and the actions taken by third parties, including, but not limited to, governmental authorities, businesses, and consumers, in response to such pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have previously adversely impacted and may from time to time in the future adversely impact the global economy, resulting in significant volatility in the global financial markets, and the demand for, and the prices of, oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which may materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Additionally, the Company’s operations rely on its workforce having access to its wells, platforms, structures, offices, and facilities. If a significant portion of the Company’s workforce cannot effectively perform their responsibilities, whether resulting from a lack of physical or virtual access, quarantines, illnesses, governmental actions or restrictions (including vaccine mandates and the reactions thereto), or other restrictions or adverse impacts resulting from a pandemic, the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n20\nRISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS\nThe Company’s operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage to or loss of property, and environmental accidents.\nThe Company’s operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, including well blowouts, explosions, fires, cratering, pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills, adverse weather conditions, including those impacting the Company’s offshore operating areas, surface spillage and ground water contamination, and failure or loss of equipment. These events, including ineffective containment of such events, have previously and could in the future result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution, and other damages for which the Company could be liable. If a significant amount of the Company’s production is interrupted, containment efforts prove to be ineffective, or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, the Company’s cash flows and, in turn, its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWeather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s revenues and production.\nDemand for oil and natural gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price the Company receives for the commodities it produces. In addition, the Company’s exploration, development, and production activities and equipment have been and can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the Gulf of America, or major storms in the North Sea, each of which have previously caused and may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. The Company’s planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.\nThe Company’s insurance policies do not cover all of the risks the Company faces, which could result in significant financial exposure.\nExploration for and production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs involves hazards, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment. The Company’s international operations are also subject to political and economic risks. The insurance coverage that the Company maintains against certain losses or liabilities arising from its operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to the Company against all operational risks. While certain insurance policies of the Company may provide coverage for such events, if the Company were to incur a significant liability for which it was not fully insured, then it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, if such an event were to occur, then the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner or may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company’s losses.\nA cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by the Company or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact the Company’s operations.\nThere are numerous and evolving risks to the Company’s data, technology, and information systems from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, and employee malfeasance. The Company’s operations are dependent on digital technologies, including to estimate reserves, process financial and operating data, analyze drilling information, and communicate with personnel. Unauthorized access to the Company’s data, technology, and information systems could lead to operational disruption, communication interruption, disruption in access to financial reporting systems, and loss, misuse, or corruption of data and proprietary information. In addition, unauthorized access to third party information systems could interrupt the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the U.S. and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market the Company’s production. Cyberattacks directed at oil and gas distribution systems have previously and could again in the future damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment. The potential impacts of a cyber incident could be made worse by a delay or failure to detect the occurrence, continuance, or extent of such an incident.\n21\nThe Company expends significant resources to protect its digital systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or externally by third parties, against cyberattacks and may be required to expend further resources as cyber threat actors become more sophisticated and as regulations related to cyberattacks become more complex. Cyberattacks, including malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees, insiders, or others with authorized access to the Company’s systems, cyber or phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, supply chain vulnerabilities, business email compromises, other attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Company’s data and systems, and other electronic security breaches could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, cause it to incur a material financial loss, subject it to possible legal claims and liability, and/or damage its reputation.\nWhile the Company has not suffered any material losses as a result of cyberattacks, there is no assurance that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future.\nMaterial differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.\nThe Company is involved in several large development projects, and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond the Company’s anticipated completion dates. These projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical vessels and equipment, and other unforeseen events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events and development costs (including for equipment and personnel) may adversely affect the Company’s large development projects (including forcing the Company to abandon such projects) and its ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. \nRISKS RELATED TO RESERVES AND LEASEHOLD ACREAGE\nDiscoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.\nThe production rate from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, future oil and gas production is highly dependent upon the Company’s level of success in adding reserves through exploration and development activities, identifying additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies, or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves. As oil or natural gas prices increase, the Company’s cost for additional reserves could also increase.\nThe Company may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.\nAlthough the Company performs a review of properties that it acquires, which the Company believes is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. There can be no assurance that acquisitions will not adversely impact the Company’s operating results, particularly during their integration into the Company’s ongoing operations.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in the process of estimating crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and their value, which is highly subjective and relies on the quality of available data and the accuracy of engineering and geological interpretation. The Company’s reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist, causing reserves quantities to change when actual prices increase or decrease. The estimates of the Company’s proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including historical production from the area compared with production from other areas, the results of drilling, testing, and production for a reservoir over time, the use of volumetric analysis versus production history, the effects of changes in laws (including emissions regulations, infrastructure modernization requirements, and taxes), future operating, workover, and remediation costs, and capital expenditures. For example, during 2024, the Company recorded $796 million of impairments for certain of its North Sea proved properties as a result of several new regulatory guidelines and obligations in the U.K. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to adjustment, and actual production, revenue, and expenditures with respect to the Company’s reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates. In addition, realization or recognition of \n22\nproved undeveloped reserves will depend on the Company’s development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.\nCertain of the Company’s undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nA sizeable portion of the Company’s acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If the leases expire, the Company will lose its right to develop the related properties. The Company’s drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.\nRISKS RELATED TO COUNTERPARTIES\nThe credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect the Company and result in a significant loss.\nThe Company is party to numerous transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions, including in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges and claims under the Company’s insurance policies, which expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty. Deterioration or volatility in the credit or financial markets, changes in commodity prices, and changes in a counterparty’s liquidity may affect the counterparties’ ability to fulfill their existing obligations to the Company. In addition, if any lender under the Company’s credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, the Company’s liquidity may be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender’s commitment thereunder. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of the Company’s counterparties or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that the Company would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to it by the distressed entity or entities, and the Company could incur a significant loss.\nThe distressed financial conditions of the Company’s partners and the purchasers of the Company’s products or assets have had and could have an adverse impact on the Company in the event they are unable to reimburse the Company for their share of costs or to pay the Company for the products or services the Company provides.\nThe Company is exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. As a result of previous severe declines in commodity prices, some of the Company’s customers and non-operating partners experienced severe financial problems. The Company cannot provide assurance that one or more of its financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to the Company (including as a result of their filing for bankruptcy or other liquidity constraints) or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows.\nThe Company’s liabilities, including for the decommissioning of previously owned assets, could be adversely affected in the event one or more of its transaction counterparties are financially distressed or become the subject of a bankruptcy case.\nThe agreements relating to the Company’s divestment of domestic and international assets generally contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations (one of the most significant of which is the decommissioning of wells and facilities) are allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, surety bonds, letters of credit, and similar arrangements. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress or bankruptcy, which may force the Company to use available cash to cover the costs of such obligations, pending final resolution of any claims the Company may have against the counterparty, which could adversely impact the Company’s cash flows, operations, or financial condition.\nFor additional information regarding Apache’s prior Gulf of America properties and the bankruptcy of the purchaser of those properties, see the information set forth under “Potential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties” in \nNote 11—Commitments and Contingencies\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n23\nThe Company does not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements or joint ventures, and the parties to such agreements or ventures may fail to meet their obligations.\nThe Company conducts many of its exploration and production (E&P) operations through joint operating agreements or joint ventures with other parties. The Company may not control decisions made under such agreements or ventures, either because it does not have a controlling interest in the venture or is not an operator under the agreement. The other parties to these arrangements may have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with the Company’s, and, therefore, decisions may be made that the Company does not believe are in its best interest. Moreover, parties to such agreements or ventures may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and the Company may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of the investment and the Company’s business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO CAPITAL MARKETS\nA downgrade in the Company’s credit rating could negatively impact its cost of and ability to access capital.\nThe Company receives debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact the Company’s credit ratings include its debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, commodity pricing levels, and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact the Company’s ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt. During 2024, Standard and Poor’s upgraded the Company’s rating to BBB-/Stable, Moody’s affirmed the Company’s rating at Baa3/Stable, and Fitch affirmed the Company’s rating at BBB-/Stable. Past ratings downgrades have required, and any future downgrades may require, the Company to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations. \nMarket conditions may restrict the Company’s ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit its financial flexibility.\nThe financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable swings. The Company has a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. The Company and/or its partners may need to seek financing to fund these or other future activities. The Company’s future access to capital, as well as that of its partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. This could significantly delay development of the Company’s property interests.\nThe Company’s syndicated revolving credit facilities currently mature in January 2030. There is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future agreements will make loans or other extensions of credit available to the Company or its subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders.\nThe Company’s ability to declare and pay dividends, and to repurchase common stock, is subject to limitations.\nThe payment of future dividends on, and any repurchases of, the Company’s common stock are each subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, taking into consideration, among other factors, the Company’s operating results, available cash, overall financial condition, credit risks, capital requirements, restrictions under the Company’s indentures and other financing agreements, restrictions under Delaware law, general business and market conditions, and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Board of Directors is not required to declare dividends on or repurchase APA’s common stock and may decide not to declare dividends or repurchase common stock at the current rate or at all. Any downward revision in the amount of dividends the Company pays to shareholders, or reduction in the pace of share repurchases, could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock.\nActions by advocacy groups to advance climate change and energy transition initiatives, unfavorable ESG ratings, and funding limitation initiatives may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the Company and to the diversion of capital from companies in the oil and gas industry, which could negatively impact the Company’s access to and costs of capital or the market for the Company’s securities.\nOrganizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform and advise their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the Company, which may cause the market for the Company’s securities to be negatively impacted.\n24\nIn addition, a number of advocacy groups have campaigned for governmental and private action to influence change in the business strategies of oil and gas companies, including through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, public pension funds, universities, and other members of the investing community. These campaign efforts have resulted in the divestment of investments in the oil and gas industry and increased pressure on lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with oil and gas companies. If investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in the oil and gas industry, the Company’s access to and costs of capital or the market for the Company’s securities may be negatively impacted.\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe Company faces strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on the Company’s results of operations.\nStrong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas E&P industry. The Company competes for leases, equipment, labor, key personnel, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production, the prices of which impact the costs of properties and the financial resources available to pursue acquisitions. These competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on the Company’s results of operations.\nThe Company’s ability to utilize net operating losses and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income may be limited if the Company experiences an ownership change.\nAs described in \nNote 10—Income Taxes\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and other tax attributes available to potentially offset future taxable income. If the Company were to experience an “ownership change” under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change, by value, in the Company’s equity ownership by five-percent shareholders over a three-year period, the Company’s ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to potentially offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Such a limitation could materially adversely affect the Company’s operating results or cash flows.\nThe Company’s ability to realize its deferred tax assets may be limited if it experiences changes in expected future cash flows related to reserves or ARO.\nAs described in \nNote 10—Income Taxes\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. Future changes in expected cash outflows for ARO or inflows from reserves could impact the Company’s ability to realize its deferred tax assets in future periods.\nAPA is a holding company and is dependent on the operations of and distributions from its subsidiaries, including Apache.\nAs a holding company, APA has no business operations of its own, and its primary assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries, including Apache. As a result, APA relies on cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends on, and make repurchases of, its common stock and to meet its financial obligations, including to service any amounts outstanding under its notes, debentures, credit agreements or commercial paper program, and any additional financial obligations that the Company may incur from time to time in the future. If the subsidiaries are limited in their ability to distribute cash to the Company, such as through legal or contractual limitations, or if the subsidiaries’ earnings or other available assets are not sufficient to pay distributions or make loans to the Company in the amounts or at the times necessary to meet the Company’s financial obligations, then the Company’s financial condition, cash flows, and reputation may be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND POLITICAL RISKS\nThe Company may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.\nAs an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, the Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, require significant capital expenditures to comply with increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. The Company’s efforts to limit its \n25\nexposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to the Company’s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company’s U.S. operations are subject to governmental risks.\nThe Company’s U.S. operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including restrictions on production, changes in taxes and other amounts payable to governments, price or gathering rate controls, environmental protection laws and regulations, and security for plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations, including in the Gulf of America.\nNew political developments, the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting the Company’s U.S. operations, and increased liability for companies operating in the oil and gas E&P industry may adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.\nProposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase the Company’s operating and capital costs.\nThe Company routinely uses fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for oil and natural gas to migrate toward the wellbore, typically at substantial depths in formations with low permeability. Governmental entities have previously taken actions to regulate, and several proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would further regulate, hydraulic fracturing. If adopted, such regulations could impose more stringent permitting, reporting, and well construction requirements or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities. These activities and the associated water disposal activities are under scrutiny due to their potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible water contamination and possible links to induced seismicity. Any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could result in increased compliance costs or additional restrictions on the Company’s U.S. operations.\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFederal, state, and foreign income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, the U.K. enacted the Energy Profits Levy (EPL), which assesses an additional levy of 35 percent, effective for the period of January 1, 2023, through March 31, 2028, on the profits of oil and gas companies operating in the U.K. and the U.K. Continental Shelf. Further changes to the EPL regime were announced in 2024, with enactment expected in 2025. Such changes, effective for the period of November 1, 2024, through March 31, 2030, would increase the levy to 38 percent, remove certain allowances, and extend the EPL period. Additionally, in the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (Corporate AMT) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, on applicable corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) that exceeds $1.0 billion for any three consecutive tax years preceding the tax year at issue. Effective January 1, 2024, the Company is subject to the Corporate AMT. Accordingly, any resulting Corporate AMT liability could adversely affect the Company’s future financial results, including earnings and cash flows.\nPrevious legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas E&P companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development. The Company is unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. Any such changes could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE\nThe impacts of energy transition could adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn recent years, increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to climate change and energy transition. This focus, together with shifting preferences and attitudes with respect to the generation and consumption of energy, the use of hydrocarbons, and the use of products manufactured with, or powered by, hydrocarbons, may result in increased availability of, and demand for, energy sources other than oil and natural gas, including wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, and the \n26\ndevelopment of, and increased demand from consumers and industries for, lower-emission products and services, including electric vehicles and renewable residential and commercial power supplies, as well as more energy-efficient products and services.\nThese developments could adversely impact the demand for products powered by or manufactured with hydrocarbons and the demand for, and in turn the prices the Company receives for, its crude oil, natural gas, and NGL products, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance.\nChanges to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact the Company’s business.\nCertain countries where the Company operates, including the U.K., either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (GHG) related fees on the Company’s operations. Exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect the Company’s cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, there has been discussion in other countries where the Company operates, including the U.S., regarding changes in legislation or heightened regulation of GHGs, including to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs and to restrict or eliminate future emissions. Moreover, in January 2024, the EPA announced a proposed rule to assess a charge on certain methane emissions in the oil and gas industry. The Company is currently evaluating the proposed rule and its applicability to the Company and is monitoring ongoing litigation related to the proposed rule.\nAdditionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations, or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, restriction of emissions, electric vehicle mandates, and combustion engine phaseouts.\nAny such legislation, regulations, or other regulatory initiatives, if enacted, or additional or increased taxes, assessments, or GHG-related fees on the Company’s operations could lead to increased operating expenses or cause the Company to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications.\nEnhanced focus on ESG matters could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations.\nEnhanced focus on ESG matters related to, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change, hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission pipelines may lead to increased regulatory review, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens, increased risk of litigation, and adverse impacts on the Company’s access to capital. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and regulatory approvals. Negative public perception could cause the permits or regulatory approvals the Company requires to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict the Company’s ability to profitably conduct its business.\nThe Company’s estimates used in various scenario planning analyses could differ materially from actual results and could expose the Company to new or additional risks.\nGiven the dynamic nature of the Company’s business, the Company generally performs annual scenario analyses with five-year time horizons. When analyzing longer-term scenarios, the Company relies on external analysis for demand scenarios, carbon pricing, and comparison-pricing scenarios, which are then compared to the Company’s internally prepared base-case pricing analysis averaged out to the year 2040. Given the numerous estimates that are required to run these scenarios, the Company’s estimates could differ materially from actual results. The Company publicly discloses these metrics and its related assumptions and analysis in its annual sustainability report. By electing to disclose these metrics, the Company may face increased scrutiny related to its ESG initiatives. Any harm to the Company’s reputation resulting from publicly disclosing such these metrics, expanding disclosures related to such metrics, or failing to achieve such metrics or abiding by such disclosures could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial performance, and growth. \nThe treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted and could expose the Company to additional costs or limit certain operations.\nThe treatment and disposal of produced water is becoming more highly regulated and restricted. Regulators in some states, such as the Railroad Commission of Texas, have taken actions to limit disposal well activities (including orders to temporarily shut down or to curtail water injection) and to require the monitoring of seismic activity. While the Company remains focused on reusing or recycling water over disposal of water, the Company’s costs for obtaining and disposing of water \n27\ncould increase significantly if reusing and recycling water becomes impractical. Further, compliance with reporting and environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage, use, and discharge of water and restrictions related to disposal wells may increase the Company’s operating costs or capital expenses or cause the Company to limit production, which could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial conditions.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\nInternational operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.\nThe Company’s operations outside the U.S. are based primarily in Egypt and the U.K., with significant exploration and appraisal activities offshore Suriname. On a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 38 percent of the Company’s 2024 production was outside the U.S., and approximately 28 percent of the Company’s estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2024, were located outside the U.S. As a result, a significant portion of the Company’s production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations, including, but not limited to strikes and civil unrest; war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, including through prospective or retroactive changes in the laws and regulations applicable to such contracts; import and export regulations; taxation policies and investment restrictions; price controls; exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluations, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds; constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area; laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions and tariffs; the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where the Company currently operates; the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the U.S.; and difficulties in enforcing the Company’s rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.\nForeign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to the Company by another country, the Company’s interests could decrease in value or be lost. Even the Company’s smaller international assets may affect its overall business and results of operations by distracting management’s attention from its more significant assets. Certain regions of the world in which the Company operates have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as the Company’s. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of the Company’s assets. This could adversely affect the Company’s interests and its future profitability.\nThe impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities, as have occurred in countries and regions in which the Company operates, may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on the Company’s operations in particular is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. The Company may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard its assets against terrorist activities.\nA further deterioration of conditions in Egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in Egypt could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business.\nFurther deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of the Company’s assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of the Company’s existing contracts with Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), or threats or acts of terrorism could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business and operations. Additionally, deteriorating economic conditions in Egypt have led to a shortage of foreign currency, including U.S. dollars, resulting in a decline in the timeliness of payments from EGPC. As described under “Revenue Recognition—Payment Terms and Contract Balances” in \nNote \n1\n—\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s receivable balance from EGPC in the past year has gradually increased as payments for the Company’s Egyptian oil and gas sales have been delayed for periods longer than historically experienced. A continuation or worsening of the currency shortage in Egypt or further deterioration of economic conditions there could lead to additional payment delays, deferrals of payment, or non-payment in the future. The Company’s operations in Egypt, excluding the impacts of a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed 22 percent of the Company’s 2024 production and accounted for 12 percent of the Company’s year-end estimated proved reserves and 21 \n28\npercent of the Company’s estimated discounted future net cash flows. If conditions continue to deteriorate in Egypt, then it could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company’s operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.\nThe Company’s operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the British pound. The Company’s financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nCertain anti-takeover provisions in the Company’s charter and Delaware law could delay or prevent a hostile takeover.\nThe Company’s charter authorizes the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the voting rights and dividend rights, dividend rates, liquidation preferences, conversion rights, redemption rights, including sinking fund provisions and redemption prices, and other terms and rights of each series of preferred stock. In addition, Delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any holder of 15 percent or more of APA’s outstanding common stock. These provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of the Company that would have been financially beneficial to APA’s shareholders.",

The Company monitors and oversees the material risks related to vulnerabilities, threats, and incidents impacting its third-party service providers via onboarding reviews, threat intelligence reports, and annual assessments.\n \nAs an example of the Company’s efforts to manage third-party cybersecurity risks, when third parties are engaged to provide software-as-a-service offerings, the Company’s standard licensing terms require such third parties to utilize safeguards to protect the Company’s data, in compliance with applicable standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) regarding security techniques, and to notify the Company within 24 hours of becoming aware of a cybersecurity incident impacting the Company’s data.\nAs of December 31, 2024, no risks from cybersecurity threats or incidents have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\nGovernance\nThe standing Cybersecurity Committee of the Company’s \nBoard of Directors\n assists with oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity program and the material risks associated with the threats identified under the program.\n Given the Cybersecurity Committee’s chair’s previous military experience in positions relevant to information security and his NACD-sponsored CERT Certificate in Cybersecurity Oversight from Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute, the committee benefits from his perspectives, skills, and training when reviewing and managing the Company’s exposure to cybersecurity risks.\n29\nAs stated in its charter, the Cybersecurity Committee’s responsibilities include: \n•\nproviding oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity policies, procedures, and plans, including the quality and effectiveness of the cybersecurity program;\n•\nreviewing the Company’s policies and procedures related to its preparation for, defense against, response to, and recovery from material cybersecurity incidents;\n•\nreviewing with management the plans and methodology for periodic assessments of the Company’s cybersecurity program by outside professionals, including the findings of such assessments and plans to remediate any material deficiencies identified by such assessments;\n•\noverseeing the Company’s management of risks related to its cybersecurity systems and processes;\n•\nreviewing with management any cybersecurity insurance program the Company may procure, including with respect to coverage and limits; and\n•\noverseeing the preparation of the Company’s disclosures in its reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the Company’s cybersecurity systems.\nThe Cybersecurity Committee also has authority to retain cybersecurity and other consultants and advisors to assist and advise the committee in its evaluation of the Company’s cybersecurity program.\nThe Cybersecurity Committee receives regular reports from Company management regarding the Company’s cybersecurity systems and programs, and the committee from time to time also receives updates from external cybersecurity specialists on cybersecurity trends and incidents, including those that may be particularly relevant to the Company’s industry or operations. In addition, in exercising its oversight responsibilities, the Cybersecurity Committee has full access to Company management and may inquire into any matter that it considers to be of material concern to the committee or the full Board of Directors.\nThe Cybersecurity Committee reports regularly to the full Board of Directors, with respect to such matters as are relevant to the committee’s discharge of its responsibilities and with respect to such recommendations as the committee deems appropriate for consideration by the Board of Directors.\n The Cybersecurity Committee also refers to the Audit Committee any matters that come to the attention of the Cybersecurity Committee that fall within the purview of the Audit Committee, including any matters related to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nAPA’s Executive Vice President, Administration, is primarily responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing the material risks associated with cybersecurity threats and the incidents identified from time to time thereunder. He manages the Company’s Information Security Team, which comprises cybersecurity professionals responsible for the day-to-day operation of the Company’s cybersecurity program and managing the Company’s threat intelligence, vulnerability management, forensics, and security architecture systems. \nAPA’s Executive Vice President, Administration, has 35 years of experience managing data and technology in the energy industry, including serving as the Company’s CIO from 2015-2020. He receives regular updates from external cybersecurity specialists on emerging trends, threats, and technologies in the cybersecurity industry. The Executive Vice President, Administration, reports directly to APA’s Chief Executive Officer and presents all relevant information to the Cybersecurity Committee.\nAdditionally, the Company’s CyberSmart Defender Network, which is a multi-disciplinary team that includes representatives from across the Company’s various departments, is responsible for raising awareness of cybersecurity issues, sharing learnings, and gaining access to advanced cybersecurity information and training.\nUnder the direction of the Executive Vice President, Administration, management’s responsibilities with respect to the Company’s cybersecurity program include (i) identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, (ii) coordinating cybersecurity incident response, (iii) assessing the health and maturity of the Company’s cybersecurity policies, procedures, and plans, including the program, and (iv) reporting overall progress to the Cybersecurity Committee and to the full Board of Directors.\nFor additional information regarding relevant cybersecurity risks, see",

The factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as DD&A, exploratory dry hole expense, asset impairments, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion, and deferred income tax expense.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $3.6 billion, up $491 million from the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher oil and gas revenues resulting from increased drilling activity in the Permian Basin and production from the acquired Callon properties, partially offset by lower realized commodity prices.\nFor a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and operating expenses, refer to “Results of Operations” in this Item 7. For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses that do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, refer to the \nStatement of Consolidated Cash Flows\n in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProceeds from Asset Divestitures\n  The Company received $1.6 billion and $29 million in proceeds from the divestiture of certain non-core assets during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For more information regarding the Company’s divestitures, refer to \nNote 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n46\nProceeds from Term Loan Facility  \nOn April 1, 2024, the Company borrowed an aggregate $1.5 billion under a syndicated credit agreement. Loan proceeds were used to refinance certain indebtedness of Callon upon the closing of the Callon acquisition. For additional details of the credit agreement, see “\nUnsecured Committed\n \nTerm Loan Facility” \nin the Liquidity section below. As of December 31, 2024, $900 million remained outstanding under the term loan facility governed by the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nProceeds from Sale of Kinetik Shares\n  The Company received $428 million and $228 million of cash proceeds from the sales of its Kinetik Shares during 2024 and 2023, respectively. For more information regarding the Company’s equity method interests, refer to \nNote 6—Equity Method Interests\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUses of Cash and Cash Equivalents\nAdditions to Oil & Gas Property \n Exploration and development cash expenditures were $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is reflective of the Company’s acquisition of Callon, which increased the number of drilling rigs being operated in the Permian Basin, partially offset by the Company’s efforts to balance workover activity in Egypt and reduce drilling activity in the North Sea as it continually assesses inventory opportunities across its diverse portfolio in 2024. The Company operated an average of 22 drilling rigs during 2024, compared to an average of 24 drilling rigs during 2023. \nLeasehold and Property Acquisitions  \nDuring 2024 and 2023, in addition to the Callon acquisition, the Company completed other leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of $60 million and $20 million, respectively.\nPayments on Term Loan Facility  \nDuring 2024, the Company made payments of $600 million on its syndicated term loan credit agreement. For additional details of the credit agreement, see “\nUnsecured Committed Term Loan Facility” \nin the Liquidity section below. As of December 31, 2024, $900 million remained outstanding under the term loan facility governed by the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nPayments on Commercial Paper and Revolving Credit Facilities, Net\n  As of December 31, 2024, outstanding borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper and U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facility were $333 million, a decrease of $40 million from December 31, 2023 as operating cash flows generated in 2024 were used to repay facility borrowings.\nPayments on Callon Credit Agreement  \nUpon closing of the Callon acquisition, the Company financed Callon’s repayment in full of its $472 million outstanding under the Callon Credit Agreement.\nPayments on Fixed-Rate Debt  \nIn April and May of 2024, the Company financed Callon’s repayment pursuant to Callon’s cash tender offers for, and redemptions of all senior notes issued under Callon’s indentures for an aggregate cash payment of $1.6 billion, reflecting principal amounts, premium to par, and associated fees.\nDuring 2023, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $74 million for an aggregate purchase price of $65 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a discount to par of an aggregate $10 million. The Company recognized a $9 million gain on these repurchases. \nThe Company may, and expects that Apache will continue to, reduce debt outstanding under its indentures from time to time.\nDividends Paid to APA Common Stockholders  \nThe Company paid $353 million and $308 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for dividends on its common stock.\nDistributions to Noncontrolling Interest - Egypt  \nSinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in the Company’s oil and gas operations in Egypt. The Company paid $268 million and $238 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in cash distributions to Sinopec.\nTreasury Stock Activity, Net  \nDuring 2024, the Company repurchased 9.2 million shares at an average price of $26.83 per share totaling $246 million, and as of December 31, 2024, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase 34.8 million shares. During 2023, the Company repurchased 8.7 million shares at an average price of $37.81 per share totaling $329 million.\n47\nLiquidity\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company’s key financial indicators as of December 31:\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n625 \n$\n87 \nTotal debt – APA and Apache \n6,044 \n5,188 \nTotal equity\n6,362 \n3,691 \nAvailable committed borrowing capacity under syndicated credit facilities\n2,966 \n2,894 \nCash and Cash Equivalents\n  As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $625 million in cash and cash equivalents. The majority of the Company’s cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.\nDebt  \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had $6.0 billion in total debt outstanding, which consisted of notes and debentures of Apache, credit facility borrowings, and finance lease obligations. As of December 31, 2024, current debt included $53 million of finance lease obligations.\nUnsecured 2022 Committed Bank Credit Facilities  \nOn April 29, 2022, the Company entered into two unsecured syndicated credit agreements for general corporate purposes that remained in effect as of December 31, 2024, but were replaced on January 15, 2025 as detailed below under “Subsequent Event — Unsecured 2025 Committed Bank Credit Facilities.” As of December 31, 2024:\n•\nOne agreement was denominated in US dollars (the 2022 USD Agreement) and provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of US$1.8 billion (including a letter of credit subfacility of up to US$750 million, of which US$150 million was committed).\n•\nThe second agreement was denominated in pounds sterling (the 2022 GBP Agreement) and provided for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of £1.5 billion for loans and letters of credit.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were $10 million of borrowings under the 2022 USD Agreement and an aggregate £303 million in letters of credit outstanding under the GBP Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, there were no letters of credit outstanding under the USD Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there were $372 million of borrowings under the 2022 USD Agreement, and an aggregate £348 million in letters of credit outstanding under the GBP Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there were no letters of credit outstanding under the 2022 USD Agreement.\nThe Company was in compliance with the terms of the 2022 Agreements as of December 31, 2024.\nThere is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future credit facilities will make loans or other extensions of credit available to APA or its subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders. \nThere is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to APA or its subsidiaries will not deteriorate. The Company closely monitors the ratings of the banks in its bank groups. Having large bank groups allows the Company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment.\nUncommitted Lines of Credit  \nEach of the Company and Apache from time to time has and uses uncommitted credit and letter of credit facilities for working capital and credit support purposes. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities. As of December 31, 2024, there were £640 million and $11 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities. As of December 31, 2023, there were £416 million and $2 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities.\n48\nCommercial Paper Program\n \nIn December 2023, the Company established a commercial paper program under which it from time to time may issue in private placements exempt from registration under the Securities Act short-term unsecured promissory notes (the CP Notes) up to a maximum aggregate face amount of $1.8 billion outstanding at any time. The maturities of the CP Notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. Outstanding CP Notes are supported by available borrowing capacity under the Company’s committed revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes, which as of December 31, 2024, included the $1.8 billion 2022 USD Agreement.\nPayment of the CP Notes has been unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Apache, such guarantee effective until the first time that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures is less than US$1.0 billion.\nThe CP Notes are sold under customary market terms in the U.S. commercial paper market at a discount from par or at par and bear interest at rates determined at the time of issuance.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had $323 million in aggregate face amount of CP Notes outstanding, which is classified as long-term debt. As of December 31, 2023, there were no CP Notes outstanding.\nUnsecured Committed Term Loan Facility\n  On January 30, 2024, APA entered into a syndicated credit agreement under which the lenders committed an aggregate $2.0 billion for senior unsecured delayed-draw term loans to APA (Term Loan Credit Agreement) the proceeds of which could be used to refinance certain indebtedness of Callon only once upon the date of the closings under the Merger Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement. Of such aggregate commitments, $1.5 billion was for term loans that would mature three years after the date of such closings (3-Year Tranche Loans) and $500 million was for term loans that would mature 364 days after the date of such closings (364-Day Tranche Loans). Apache has guaranteed obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement effective until the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures first is less than $1.0 billion.\nOn April 1, 2024 (the Closing Date), APA closed the transactions under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, electing to borrow an aggregate $1.5 billion in 3-Year Tranche Loans maturing April 1, 2027 and to allow the lender commitments for the 364-Day Tranche Loans to expire. As of December 31, 2024, there were $900 million in 3-Year Tranche Loans remaining outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nLoan proceeds were used to refinance certain indebtedness of Callon upon the substantially simultaneous closing of APA’s acquisition of Callon pursuant to the Merger Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses. APA may at any time prepay loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. \nBorrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement bear interest at one of two rate options selected by APA, being either (i) an alternate base rate (as defined), plus a margin (Term Base Rate Margin) varying from 0.375% to 1.125% for 3-Year Tranche Loans until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and 0.625% to 1.375% for 3-Year Tranche Loans after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, or (ii) an adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined), plus a margin (Term Applicable Margin) varying from 1.375% to 2.125% for 3-Year Tranche Loans until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and 1.625% to 2.375% for 3-Year Tranche Loans after the second anniversary of the Closing Date.\nMargins are at varying rates per annum determined by reference to the senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money of APA, or if such indebtedness is not rated and the Apache guaranty is in effect, of Apache (Long-Term Debt Rating). As of December 31, 2024, Apache’s Long-Term Debt Rating applied, and the Term Base Rate Margin was 0.75% for 3-Year Tranche Loans, and the Term Applicable Margin was 1.75% for 3-Year Tranche Loans. \nAPA is subject to representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, such as:\n•\nA financial covenant requires APA to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2024, APA’s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the Term Loan Credit Agreement was 19 percent.\n•\nA negative covenant restricts the ability of APA and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with customary exceptions and exceptions for liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the U.S. and Canada. Liens on assets also are permitted if debt secured thereby does not exceed 15 percent of APA’s consolidated net tangible assets or approximately $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n49\n•\nNegative covenants restrict APA’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, a borrower’s disposition of substantially all of its assets, prohibitions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to make payments to borrowers, and guarantees by APA or certain subsidiaries of debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.\n•\nLenders may accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending commitments for nonpayment and other breaches; if APA or certain subsidiaries default on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold, or has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold; or APA undergoes a specified change in control. Such acceleration and termination are automatic upon specified insolvency events of APA or certain subsidiaries.\nThe Term Loan Credit Agreement does not permit lenders to accelerate maturity based on unspecified material adverse changes and does not have prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.\nThe Company was in compliance with the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.\nSubsequent Event—Unsecured 2025 Committed Bank Credit Facilities\nOn January 15, 2025, the Company terminated commitments under the 2022 Agreements and in replacement thereof, entered into two unsecured syndicated credit agreements for general corporate purposes on terms substantially the same as those of the 2022 Agreements:\n•\nOne agreement is denominated in US dollars (the 2025 USD Agreement) and provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility for loans and letters of credit, with aggregate commitments of US$2.0 billion (including a letter of credit subfacility of up to US$750 million, of which US$250 million currently is committed). APA may increase commitments up to an aggregate US$2.5 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. This facility matures in January 2030, subject to the Company’s two, one-year extension options.\n•\nThe second agreement is denominated in pounds sterling (the 2025 GBP Agreement) and provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of £1.5 billion for loans and letters of credit. This facility matures in January 2030, subject to the Company’s two, one-year extension options.\nApache has guaranteed obligations under each of the 2025 USD Agreement and 2025 GBP Agreement (each, a 2025 Agreement) effective until the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures first is less than US$1.0 billion.\nLetters of credit are available under each 2025 Agreement for credit support needs of APA and its subsidiaries, including in respect of North Sea decommissioning obligations. As of January 15, 2025, letters of credit aggregating approximately £253 million originally issued under the 2022 GBP Agreement were deemed issued and outstanding under the 2025 GBP Agreement.\nAll borrowings under the 2025 USD Agreement bear interest at one of two per annum rate options selected by the borrower, being either an alternate base rate (as defined), plus a margin varying from 0.0% to 0.675% (Base Rate Margin), or an adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined), plus a margin varying from 1.00% to 1.675% (Applicable Margin). All borrowings under the 2025 GBP Agreement bear interest with respect to any business day at an adjusted rate per annum determined by reference to the Sterling Overnight Index Average with respect to such business day published by the Bank of England, plus the Applicable Margin.\nEach 2025 Agreement also requires the borrower to pay quarterly (i) a facility fee on total commitments at a per annum rate that varies from 0.125% to 0.325% and (ii) a commission on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect.  Customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks.\nMargins and facility fees are at varying rates per annum determined by reference to the senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money of APA, or if such indebtedness is not rated and the Apache guaranty is in effect, of Apache (Long-Term Debt Rating). APA’s Long-Term Debt Rating currently applies, and the Base Rate Margin is 0.30%, the Applicable Margin is 1.30%, and the facility fee is 0.20%.\n50\nBorrowers under each 2025 Agreement, which include certain subsidiaries of APA, may borrow, prepay, and reborrow loans and obtain letters of credit, and APA may obtain letters of credit for the account of its subsidiaries, in each case subject to representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default, such as:\n•\nA financial covenant requires APA to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 65% at the end of any fiscal quarter.\n•\nA negative covenant restricts the ability of APA and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with customary exceptions and exceptions for liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the U. S. and Canada. Liens on assets also are permitted if debt secured thereby does not exceed 15% of APA’s consolidated net tangible assets.\n•\nNegative covenants restrict APA’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, a borrower’s disposition of substantially all of its assets, prohibitions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to make payments to borrowers, and guarantees by APA or certain subsidiaries of debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.\n•\nLenders may accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches; if a borrower or certain subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold, or has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold; or APA undergoes a specified change in control. Such acceleration and termination are automatic upon specified insolvency events of a borrower or certain subsidiaries.\nThe 2025 Agreements do not require collateral, do not have a borrowing base, do not permit lenders to accelerate maturity or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes, and do not have borrowing restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.\nSubsequent Event—APA Exchange and Tender Offers for Apache Indenture Debt\nOn January 10, 2025, the Company settled its private exchange and cash tender offers for certain notes and debentures issued by Apache under its indentures. The Company also then settled its private offering of new notes to fund in part its purchase of Apache notes in APA’s cash tender offers.  In settling these offerings pursuant to their respective terms:\n•\nA\nPA issued new notes and debentures under its indentures in aggregate principal amounts of (i) $2.5 billion in exchange for Apache notes and debentures tendered and accepted in APA’s exchange offers, (ii) $203 million in exchange for Apache notes tendered in the cash tender offers in excess of the stated maximum purchase amount or series caps, and (iii) $850 million in the new notes offering, comprised of $350 million aggregate principal amount of APA’s 6.10% Notes due 2035 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of APA’s 6.75% Notes due 2055.\n•\nIn addition to issuing the APA notes in the exchange offers, APA paid a total of $2.5 million in cash as part of the exchange consideration.\n•\nAPA paid a total of $869 million in cash in the tender offers (comprised of tender offer consideration, exchange consideration for tendered notes exchanged, early participation premium, and accrued interest) for the aggregate $1 billion in principal amount of Apache notes tendered and accepted in the cash tender offers.\n•\nNet proceeds from the sale of the notes in APA’s new notes offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $839 million and used to fund in part APA’s purchase of Apache notes in APA’s cash tender offers.\n•\nEach series of APA notes and debentures issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers has the same interest rate, maturity date, and interest payment dates and the same optional redemption prices (if any) as the corresponding series of Apache notes and debentures for which they were exchanged.\n•\nEach series of APA notes and debentures issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers and new notes offering are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache until the first time that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures is less than $1 billion.\n•\nAPA entered into two registration rights agreements, one covering notes and debentures issued in APA’s exchange and tender offers and one covering notes issued in APA’s new notes offering (each a Registration Rights Agreement). \n51\nThese offerings were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), in reliance upon an exemption therefrom, and the APA notes and debentures issued pursuant to such offers are subject to certain transfer restrictions. Each Registration Rights Agreement requires APA and Apache to use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be filed a registration statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange each series of APA notes issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers or new notes offering, as applicable, for registered notes issued by APA and guaranteed, if applicable, by Apache containing terms substantially identical in all material respects to the applicable series of APA notes issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers or new notes offering (except that the registered notes will not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions or any increase in annual interest rate) and (ii) cause such registration statement to become effective under the Securities Act.  If, among other events, such exchange offers are not completed on or prior to the 360th day following January 10, 2025, then additional interest will accrue on the principal amount of such registrable securities at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period beginning on the day immediately following such registration default (which rate will be increased by an additional 0.25% per annum for each subsequent 90-day period that such additional interest continues to accrue, provided that the rate at which such additional interest accrues may in no event exceed 1.00% per annum). To the extent Apache’s guarantee of the registrable securities is terminated in accordance with the terms of such guarantee, the registered notes will not be guaranteed by Apache, the exchange offer and registration requirements with respect thereto will be the sole obligation of the Company, and Apache will automatically be released from all obligations under the applicable Registration Rights Agreement.\nThe following table presents the aggregate principal amounts of notes and debentures outstanding under indentures of APA and Apache on January 10, 2025 upon settlement of the APA’s exchange and tender offers and new notes offering (Apache notes due 2025 were not included in APA’s exchange or tender offers):\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAPA\nApache\n(In millions)\n4.625% notes due 2025\n$\n— \n$\n51 \n7.70% notes due March 2026\n(1)(5)(6)\n58 \n21 \n7.95% notes due April 2026\n(1)(5)(6)\n56 \n76 \n4.875% notes due 2027\n(4)(5)(6)\n39 \n69 \n4.375% notes due 2028\n(4)(5)(6)\n239 \n86 \n7.75% notes due 2029\n(2)(5)(6)\n164 \n72 \n4.25% notes due 2030\n(4)(5)(6)\n374 \n142 \n6.0% notes due 2037\n(1)(5)(6)\n341 \n102 \n5.1% notes due 2040\n(1)(5)(6)\n539 \n225 \n5.25% notes due 2042\n(1)(5)(6)\n209 \n65 \n4.75% notes due 2043\n(3)(5)(6)\n153 \n79 \n4.25% notes due 2044\n(3)(5)(6)\n77 \n24 \n7.375% debentures due 2047\n(1)(5)(6)\n126 \n24 \n5.35% notes due 2049\n(4)(5)(6)\n330 \n57 \n7.625% debentures due 2096\n(1)(5)(6)\n37 \n2 \n6.10% notes due 2035\n(7)\n350 \n— \n6.75% notes due 2055\n(7)\n500 \n— \nTotal\n$\n3,592 \n$\n1,095 \n(1)\nThe Apache March 2026 notes, the Apache April 2026 notes, the Apache 2037 notes, the Apache 2040 notes, the Apache 2042 notes, the Apache 2047 debentures, and the Apache 2096 debentures were issued under the Senior Indenture, dated as of February 15, 1996, between Apache and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee), as trustee (an Apache Indenture).\n(2)\nThe Apache 2029 notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of November 23, 1999, between Apache (as successor to Apache Finance Canada Corporation), and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee), as trustee (an Apache Indenture).\n(3)\nThe Apache 2043 notes and the Apache 2044 notes were issued under the Senior Indenture, dated as of May 19, 2011, between Apache and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (an Apache Indenture).\n(4)\nThe Apache 2027 notes, the Apache 2028 notes, the Apache 2030 notes, and the Apache 2049 notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of August 14, 2018, between Apache and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (an Apache Indenture).\n52\n(5)\nIn connection with APA’s exchange and tender offers, Apache solicited the consents of the holders of these Apache notes and debentures to amend the applicable Apache Indenture to remove certain restrictive and reporting covenants. The Apache notes and debentures are senior unsecured obligations of Apache. Apache received consents sufficient to approve the proposed amendments to the Apache Indentures with respect to the Apache March 2026 notes, the Apache 2028 notes, the Apache 2029 notes, the Apache 2030 notes, the Apache 2037 notes, the Apache 2040 notes, the Apache 2042 notes, the Apache 2043 notes, the Apache 2044 notes, the Apache 2047 debentures, the Apache 2049 notes, and the Apache 2096 debentures. As a result, Apache and the respective trustee for the Apache Indentures entered into supplemental indentures on January 10, 2025, implementing the proposed amendments effective as of that date.\n(6)\nThe APA March 2026 notes, the APA April 2026 notes, the APA 2027 notes, the APA 2028 notes, the APA 2029 notes, the APA 2030 notes, the APA 2037 notes, the APA 2040 notes, the APA 2042 notes, the APA 2043 notes, the APA 2044 notes, the APA 2047 debentures, the APA 2049 notes, and the APA 2096 debentures were issued under the Indenture, dated as of June 30, 2021, between the Company, as issuer, and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. These APA notes and debentures were issued in APA’s exchange and tender offers for Apache’s notes and debentures.\n(7)\nThe APA 2035 notes and the APA 2055 notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of December 11, 2024, between the Company, as issuer, and Regions Bank, as trustee. These APA notes were issued in APA’s new notes offering to fund in part its purchase of Apache notes in APA’s cash tender offers.\nSubsequent Event—Open Market Repurchases of Apache Indenture Debt\nIn the first quarter of 2025 through the date of this filing, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $55 million for an aggregate purchase price of $50 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a discount to par of an aggregate $7 million. The Company recognized a $6 million gain on these repurchases. The repurchases were partially financed by APA’s borrowing under the Company’s commercial paper program.\nContractual Obligations\nPurchase Obligations  \nFrom time to time, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had contractual obligations totaling $1.1 billion, of which $963 million is related to U.S. firm transportation contracts, $45 million is related to the merged concession agreement with the EGPC, and $110 million is related to other items. Under terms agreed to in the Egypt modernized PSC, the Company committed to spend a minimum of $3.5 billion on exploration, development, and operating activities by March 31, 2026. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has met and fully satisfied the obligation.\nLeases  \nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into various lease agreements for real estate, drilling rigs, vessels, aircrafts, and equipment related to its exploration and development activities, which are typically classified as operating leases under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842 (Leases). As of December 31, 2024, the Company had net undiscounted minimum commitments of $467 million and $37 million for operating and finance leases, respectively. \nInterest Expense\n  Future interest payments based on the current maturity dates of the Company’s fixed-rate notes and debentures as of December 31, 2024 are approximately $3.6 billion. \n53\nFor additional information regarding these obligations, refer to \nNote 9—Debt and Financing Costs\n and \nNote 11—Commitments and Contingencies\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor information regarding the Company’s liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties, refer to \nNote 8—Asset Retirement Obligation\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor information regarding pension or postretirement benefit obligations, refer to \nNote 12—Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. The Company’s management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $2 million for environmental remediation and approximately $20 million for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental and legal contingencies and other commitments, please see \nNote 11—Commitments and Contingencies\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWith respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of America, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of America to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. While the NTL was paused in mid-2017 and is currently listed on BOEM’s website as “rescinded,” if reinstated, the NTL will likely require that the Company provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to the Company’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of America leases. Additionally, the Company is not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which the Company has sold Gulf of America assets or with whom the Company has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.\nPotential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. The Company has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the Gulf of America (GOA) where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. If a purchaser of such GOA assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, APA’s subsidiaries could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. In such event, such subsidiaries may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.\nIn 2013, Apache sold its GOA Shelf operations and properties and its GOA operating subsidiary, GOM Shelf LLC (GOM Shelf) to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood). Fieldwood assumed the obligation to decommission the properties held by GOM Shelf and the properties acquired from Apache and its other subsidiaries (collectively, the Legacy GOA Assets). On February 14, 2018, Fieldwood filed for (and subsequently emerged from) Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On August 3, 2020, Fieldwood filed for (and subsequently emerged from) Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for a second time. Upon emergence from this second bankruptcy, \nthe Legacy GOA Assets were separated into a standalone company, which was subsequently merged into GOM Shelf. Under GOM Shelf’s limited liability company agreement, the proceeds of production of the Legacy GOA Assets are to be used to fund the operation of GOM Shelf and the decommissioning of Legacy GOA Assets.\n \nPursuant to the terms of the original transaction, as amended in the first bankruptcy, \nthe securing of the asset retirement obligations for the Legacy GOA Assets as and when Apache is required to perform or pay for any such decommissioning was accomplished through the posting of letters of credit in favor of Apache (Letters of Credit), the provision of two bonds (Bonds) in favor of Apache, and the establishment of a trust account of which Apache was a beneficiary and which was funded by net profits interests (NPIs) depending on future oil prices. In addition, after such sources have been exhausted, Apache agreed upon \n54\nresolution of GOM Shelf’s second bankruptcy to provide a standby loan to GOM Shelf of up to $400 million to perform decommissioning, with such standby loan secured by a first and prior lien on the Legacy GOA Assets.\nBy letter dated April 5, 2022 (replacing two earlier letters) and by subsequent letter dated March 1, 2023, GOM Shelf notified the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) that it was unable to fund the decommissioning obligations that it was obligated to perform on certain of the Legacy GOA Assets. As a result, Apache and other current and former owners in these assets have received orders from BSEE and demands from third parties to decommission certain of the Legacy GOA Assets included in GOM Shelf’s notifications to BSEE. Apache expects to receive similar orders and demands on the other Legacy GOA Assets included in GOM Shelf’s notification letters. Apache has also received orders to decommission other Legacy GOA Assets that were not included in GOM Shelf’s notification letters. Further, Apache anticipates that GOM Shelf may send additional such notices to BSEE in the future and that it may receive additional orders from BSEE requiring it to decommission other Legacy GOA Assets.\nOn June 21, 2023, two sureties that issued Bonds directly to Apache and two sureties that issued bonds to the issuing bank on the Letters of Credit filed suit against Apache in a case styled \nZurich American Insurance Company, HCC International Insurance Company PLC, Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company and Everest Reinsurance Company (Insurers) v. Apache Corporation\n, Cause No. 2023-38238 in the 281\nst\n Judicial District Court, Harris County Texas. The sureties sought to prevent Apache from drawing on the $148 million in Bonds and $350 million in Letters of Credit and further alleged that they are discharged from their reimbursement obligations related to decommissioning costs and are entitled to other relief. On July 20, 2023, the 281\nst\n Judicial District Court denied the Insurers’ request for a temporary injunction. On July 26, 2023, Apache removed the suit to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division). Since the time the sureties filed their state court lawsuit, Apache has drawn down the entirety of the $350 million in Letters of Credit. Apache has also sought to draw down on the Bonds; however, the sureties refused to honor such Bond draws. On September 12, 2024, the bankruptcy court issued its opinion (1) finding that sureties’ state court lawsuit against Apache was void; (2) holding that Apache’s claims against the sureties for unpaid amounts may proceed in bankruptcy court; and (3) holding the sureties in civil contempt and awarding attorneys’ fees to Apache as a sanction. The parties settled their dispute in the first quarter of 2025, which resulted in, among other things, mutual releases, the retention by Apache of all amounts drawn on the Letters of Credit, and payment to Apache of $140 million under the Bonds.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded an asset of $178 million representing the remaining amount the Company expects to be reimbursed from security related to these decommissioning costs.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Apache estimates that its potential liability to fund the remaining decommissioning of Legacy GOA Assets and assets previously sold to other operators ranges from $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion on an undiscounted basis. Management does not believe any specific estimate within this range is a better estimate than any other. Accordingly, the Company recorded contingent liabilities in the amounts of $1.0 billion and $824 million as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the total liability recorded as of December 31, 2024, $929 million is reflected under the caption “Decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of America properties” and $88 million is reflected under “Other current liabilities” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Changes in significant assumptions impacting Apache’s estimated liability, including expected well decommissioning spread rates, derrick barge rates, and planned abandonment logistics, could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued.\nThe Company recognized $273 million of “Losses on previously sold Gulf of America properties” during 2024 to reflect the net impact of an increase in estimated decommissioning costs of Legacy GOA Assets which BSSE may order the Company to decommission. The loss includes $67 million related to properties previously sold to third parties other than Fieldwood for which the Company received BSSE orders to decommission during the year, as well as an increase to the estimated net liability the Company expects to incur for decommissioning Legacy GOA Assets. The Company also recognized losses on previously sold Gulf of America properties of $212 million and $157 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively, in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.\n55\nInsurance Program\nThe Company maintains insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to its assets, general liabilities, workers’ compensation, employers’ liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. The Company’s insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that it must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. Additionally, the Company’s insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. There is no assurance that insurance will adequately protect the Company against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Further, the Company does not have coverage in place for a variety of other risks including Gulf of America named windstorm and business interruption. Service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify the Company for injuries and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider. \nThe Company purchases multi-year political risk insurance from The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit Trade (ICIEC, an agency of the Islamic Development Bank) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. In the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $500 million.\nFuture insurance coverage for the Company’s industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable or unavailable on terms economically acceptable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company prepares its financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. The Company identifies certain accounting policies involving estimation as critical accounting estimates based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting estimates address accounting matters that are inherently uncertain due to unknown future resolution of such matters. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each critical accounting estimate. The following is a discussion of the Company’s most critical accounting estimates.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairments\nLong-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties and GPT assets, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. If there is an indication that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach.\nUnder the income approach, the fair value of each asset group is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, expected throughput volumes for GPT assets, discount rates, and other variables. Key assumptions used in developing a discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating and administrative costs. The Company discounts the resulting future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants. \nTo assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, when available, management uses a market approach to compare the fair value to similar assets. This requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable assets, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums.\n56\nAlthough the fair value estimate of each asset group is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. Negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the asset group, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded material impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering, processing, and transmission facilities during 2024. For discussion of these impairments, see “Fair Value Measurements” of \nNote 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nAccounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. The amount of goodwill or bargain purchase gain recognized, if any, is determined based on the consideration transferred compared to the amounts of the identifiable net assets acquired on the acquisition date.\nThe purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known.\nIn estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company has made various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved oil and natural gas properties. The fair value of proved oil and natural gas properties as of the acquisition date were estimated using the income approach where fair value was determined based on the expected future cash flows from estimated proved oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and related discounted future net cash flows as of that date. Significant inputs to the fair value estimate included estimates of future production volumes, future operating and development costs, future commodity prices, and a weighted average cost of capital discount rate.\nThe estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Historically there has been volatility in oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. Additionally, the actual timing of the production could be different than projected volumes as of the acquisition date.\nReserves Estimates\nProved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.\nDespite judgment involved in these engineering estimates, the Company’s reserves are used throughout its financial statements. For example, since the Company uses the units-of-production method to amortize its oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact DD&A expense. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. Finally, these reserves are the basis for the Company’s supplemental oil and gas disclosures. For more information regarding the Company’s supplemental oil and gas disclosures, refer to \nNote 17—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited)\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous twelve months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.\nThe Company has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.\n57\nOffshore Decommissioning Contingency\nThe Company has potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. For information regarding estimated potential decommissioning obligations on sold properties, please refer to “Potential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties” above and in \nNote 11—Commitments and Contingencies\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company’s estimated contingent obligation is primarily associated with the abandonment, removal and decommissioning of offshore wells and platforms in the Gulf of America. Estimating any future obligation requires significant judgment. The Company utilizes actual abandonment and decommissioning costs incurred as the basis to estimate the expected cash outflows for future obligations. Actual costs incurred often vary based on each structure’s condition, depth-of-water, type, and other similar factors, which are key considerations when estimating the remaining well and platform decommissioning obligation. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, and safety considerations. Changes in significant assumptions or the regulatory framework impacting the Company’s estimated liability could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued.\nAsset Retirement Obligation (ARO)\nThe Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. The Company’s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, and safety considerations.\nARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with the Company’s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company’s oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements and tax returns. Management routinely assesses the ability to realize the Company’s deferred tax assets. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).\n58\nITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company’s exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas, and NGL prices, interest rates, or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how the Company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe Company’s revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices the Company receives for its crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile because of unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather, political climate, and global supply and demand. The Company continually monitors its market risk exposure, as oil and gas supply and demand are impacted by uncertainties in the commodity and financial markets associated with the conflict in Ukraine, the conflict in Israel and Gaza, actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including OPEC+, global inflation, and other current events.\nThe Company’s average crude oil price realizations decreased 3 percent to $78.08 per barrel in 2024 from $80.72 per barrel in 2023. The Company’s average natural gas price realizations decreased 32 percent to $1.97 per Mcf in 2024 from $2.91 per Mcf in 2023. The Company’s average NGL price realizations increased 8 percent to $23.37 per barrel in 2024 from $21.54 per barrel in 2023. Based on average daily production for 2024, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized oil price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $89 million, a $0.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized natural gas price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $30 million, and a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized NGL price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $27 million.\nThe Company periodically enters into derivative positions on a portion of its projected crude oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. Such derivative positions may include the use of futures contracts, swaps, and/or options. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no open commodity derivative positions. Refer to \nNote 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report Form 10-K for notional volumes and terms with the Company’s derivative contracts.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had $4.8 billion, net, in outstanding notes and debentures, all of which was fixed-rate debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.34 percent. Although near-term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of fixed-rate debt, such changes do not expose the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss associated with that debt. \nThe Company is also exposed to interest rate risk related to its interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances and amounts outstanding under its term loan facility, commercial paper program, and syndicated credit facilities. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $625 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 98 percent of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. As of December 31, 2024, there were $1.2 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Company’s term loan facility, commercial paper program, and syndicated revolving credit facilities. Changes in the interest rate applicable to short-term investments, term loan facility, commercial paper program, and credit facility borrowings are expected to have an immaterial impact on earnings and cash flows but could impact interest costs associated with future debt issuances or any future borrowings.\n59\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company’s cash activities relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. The Company’s North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, while the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. The Company’s Egypt production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Transactions denominated in British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period. The Company monitors foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is conducting business and may, from time to time, implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nForeign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Foreign currency gains and losses are included as either a component of “Other, net” under “Revenues and Other” or, as is the case when the Company re-measures its foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Company’s provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations. Foreign currency net gain or loss of $5 million would result from a 10 percent weakening or strengthening, respectively, in the British pound as of December 31, 2024.\nITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements and supplementary financial information required to be filed under this Item 8 are presented on pages F-1 through F-62 in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference. \nITEM 9.\nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nThe financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their audit report appearing herein.

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our Company’s board of directors, applicable to all Company directors and all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).\n Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors. Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of APA Corporation and subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3.\n/s/  John J. Christmann IV\nChief Executive Officer\n(principal executive officer)\n/s/  Stephen J. Riney\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer\n(principal financial officer)\n/s/  Rebecca A. Hoyt\nSenior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller\n(principal accounting officer)\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 28, 2025\nF-1\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of APA Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited APA Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, APA Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity and noncontrolling interest for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 28, 2025\nF-2\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of APA Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of APA Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity and noncontrolling interest for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization of property and equipment\nDescription of\nthe Matter\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the Company’s property and equipment was $12,646 million, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was $2,266 million for the year then ended. As described in Note 1, the Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method based on proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by the Company’s internal reservoir engineers.\nF-3\nProved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Judgment is required by the Company’s internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves. Estimating proved oil and gas reserves requires the selection of inputs, including historical production, oil and gas price assumptions, and operating costs, among others. Because of the complexity involved in estimating oil and gas reserves, management engaged independent petroleum engineers to audit the proved oil and gas reserve estimates prepared by the Company’s internal reservoir engineers for select properties as of December 31, 2024.   \nAuditing the Company’s DD&A calculations is complex because of the use of the work of the internal reservoir engineers and the independent petroleum engineers. \nHow We\nAddressed the\nMatter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over its process to calculate DD&A, including management’s controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data utilized by the engineers for use in estimating oil and gas reserves.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company’s internal reservoir engineers responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates and the independent petroleum engineers used to audit the proved oil and gas reserve estimates. Additionally, we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by the engineers in estimating proved oil and gas reserves and tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used by the engineers related to historical production volumes. We also tested that the DD&A expense calculations are based on the appropriate proved oil and gas reserve balances from the Company’s reserve report.\nAccounting for asset retirement obligation for the North Sea segment\nDescription of\nthe Matter\nAt December 31, 2024, the asset retirement obligation (ARO) balance totaled $2,694 million. As further described in Note 8, the Company’s ARO reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with the Company’s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The estimation of the ARO related to the North Sea segment requires significant judgment given the magnitude of the expected retirement costs.\nAuditing the Company’s ARO for the North Sea segment is complex and highly judgmental because of the significant estimation required by management in determining the obligation. In particular, the estimate was sensitive to retirement cost estimates, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions.\nHow We\nAddressed the\nMatter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over its ARO estimation process, including management’s review of the significant assumptions that have a material effect on the determination of the obligation.\nTo test the ARO for the North Sea segment, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the significant assumptions and inputs used in the valuation, such as retirement cost estimates. For example, we evaluated retirement cost estimates by comparing the Company’s estimates to underlying third party evidence or market information. We also involved our internal specialists in testing the underlying retirement cost estimates.\nAccounting for decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of America properties\nDescription of\nthe Matter\nAt December 31, 2024, the decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of America properties (decommissioning contingency) balance totaled $1 billion. As further described in Note 11, the Company’s decommissioning contingency reflects the estimated undiscounted potential liability to fund decommissioning of the sold Gulf of America properties. The estimation of the decommissioning contingency requires significant judgment given the magnitude and higher estimation uncertainty of the expected retirement costs.\nF-4\nAuditing the Company’s decommissioning contingency is complex and highly judgmental because of the significant estimation required by management in determining the decommissioning contingency. In particular, the estimate was sensitive to retirement cost estimates, which are subjective assumptions affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions.\nHow We\nAddressed the\nMatter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over its decommissioning contingency estimation process, including management’s review of the significant assumptions that have a material effect on the determination of the contingency.\nTo test the decommissioning contingency, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the significant assumptions and inputs used developing the retirement cost estimates. For example, we evaluated retirement cost estimates by comparing the Company’s estimates to market information. We also involved our internal specialists in testing the underlying retirement cost estimates.\nEvaluation of the fair value measurement of proved oil and gas properties acquired in the Callon Petroleum business combination\nDescription of\nthe Matter\nDuring 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Callon Petroleum Company resulting in the recognition of the fair value of property and equipment of $4,502 million. As described in Note 2, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.\nThe Company applied a discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the proved oil and gas properties acquired. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices, future production volumes, and discount rate using a market-based weighted average cost of capital. Judgment is required by the Company’s internal reservoir engineers in estimating future production quantities.\nAuditing the Company’s fair value measurement of the proved oil and gas properties acquired is complex because of the use of the work of the Company’s internal reservoir engineers in estimating future production and the evaluation of management’s determination of the inputs described above. In evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor judgement and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\nHow We\nAddressed the\nMatter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls to estimate the fair value of the acquired proved oil and gas properties, including management’s review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations.\nTo test the fair value of the acquired proved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company’s internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the future production volumes. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the fair value calculation. We also involved our valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the fair value estimate.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

part of this statement.\nF-10\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNature of Operations\nAPA Corporation (APA or the Company) is an independent energy company that owns consolidated subsidiaries that explore for, develop, and produce crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. The Company’s business has oil and gas operations in \nthree\n geographic areas: the United States (U.S.), Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). APA also has active development, exploration, and appraisal operations ongoing in Suriname, as well as exploration interests in Uruguay, Alaska, and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. Prior to the BCP Business Combination defined below, the Company’s midstream business was operated by Altus Midstream Company (ALTM) through its subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus).\n \n1.   \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAccounting policies used by APA and its subsidiaries reflect industry practices and conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The Company’s financial statements for prior periods may include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current-year presentation. Significant accounting policies are discussed below.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of APA and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.\nThe Company’s undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships are proportionately consolidated. The Company consolidates all other investments in which, either through direct or indirect ownership, it has more than a 50 percent voting interest or controls the financial and operating decisions. \nSinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) owns a one-third minority participation in the Company’s consolidated Egypt oil and gas business as a noncontrolling interest, which is reflected as a separate noncontrolling interest component of equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company has determined that a limited partnership and APA subsidiary, which has control over APA’s Egyptian operations, qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under GAAP. Apache consolidates the activities of APA’s Egyptian operations because it has concluded that a wholly owned subsidiary has a controlling financial interest in APA’s Egyptian operations and was determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nOn February 22, 2022, ALTM closed a transaction to combine with privately owned BCP Raptor Holdco LP (BCP and, together with BCP Raptor Holdco GP, LLC, the Contributed Entities) in an all-stock transaction, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement entered into by and among ALTM, Altus Midstream LP, New BCP Raptor Holdco, LLC (the Contributor), and BCP (the BCP Contribution Agreement). Pursuant to the BCP Contribution Agreement, the Contributor contributed all of the equity interests of the Contributed Entities (the Contributed Interests) to Altus Midstream LP, with each Contributed Entity becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Altus Midstream LP (the BCP Business Combination). Upon closing the transaction, the combined entity was renamed Kinetik Holdings Inc. (Kinetik), and the Company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of Kinetik. The Company further determined that Kinetik no longer qualified as a VIE under GAAP.\n \nAs a result, the Company deconsolidated ALTM on February 22, 2022. Refer to \nNote 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures\n for further detail.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a designated director on the Kinetik board of directors. The Company’s designated director resigned from the Kinetik board of directors on April 3, 2024. As a result, the Company is considered to have had significant influence over Kinetik during the periods presented prior to the designated director’s resignation from the Kinetik board of directors.\nInvestments in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded separately as “Equity method interests” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company elected the fair value option to account for its equity method interest in Kinetik.\n Refer to \nNote 6—Equity Method Interests\n for further detail.\nF-11\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the Company’s financial statements, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. \nSignificant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the estimates of fair value for long-lived assets (refer to “Fair Value Measurements” and “Property and Equipment” sections in this Note 1 below), the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities (refer to \nNote 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures\n), the fair value of equity method interests (refer to “Equity Method Interests” within this Note 1 below and \nNote 6—Equity Method Interests\n), the assessment of asset retirement obligations (refer to \nNote 8—Asset Retirement Obligation\n), the estimate of income taxes (refer to \nNote 10—Income Taxes\n), the estimation of the contingent liability representing Apache’s potential decommissioning obligations on sold properties in the Gulf of America (refer to \nNote 11—Commitments and Contingencies\n), and the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom (refer to \nNote 17—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited)\n).\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10-35, “Fair Value Measurement” (ASC 820), provides a hierarchy that prioritizes and defines the types of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from inputs that are significant and unobservable; hence, these valuations have the lowest priority.\nThe valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value include a market approach, an income approach, and a cost approach. A market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. An income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing models, and the excess earnings method. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).\nRefer to \nNote 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n, \nNote 9—Debt and Financing Costs\n, and \nNote 12—Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans\n for further detail regarding the Company’s fair value measurements recorded on a recurring basis.\nThe Company also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis when certain qualitative assessments of its assets indicate a potential impairment or when allocating the purchase price for acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination.\nDuring 2024, the Company continued its economic assessment of its North Sea assets in light of several new regulatory guidelines and obligations surrounding significant tax levies and modernization of aging infrastructure. The Company determined the expected returns do not economically support making investments required under the combined impact of the regulations, and it will cease production at its facilities in the North Sea prior to 2030. As a result, in the third quarter of 2024 the Company performed a fair value assessment of the present value of its oil and gas assets in the North Sea. Accordingly, the Company recognized impairments of $\n796\n million on certain proved properties in the North Sea, which were written down to their estimated fair values as of September 30, 2024. This impairment is discussed in further detail below in “Property and Equipment — Oil and Gas Property.”\nOn April 1, 2024, APA completed its acquisition of Callon Petroleum Company (Callon) in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $\n4.5\n billion, inclusive of Callon’s debt (the Callon acquisition). The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date, using various Level 3 fair value measurements. Material assets and liabilities acquired are discussed further below:\nF-12\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n•\nThe most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved oil and natural gas properties. The fair value of proved oil and natural gas properties as of the acquisition date were estimated using the income approach, where fair value was determined based on the expected future cash flows from estimated proved oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and related discounted future net cash flows as of that date. Significant inputs to the fair value estimate included estimates of future production volumes, future operating and development costs, future commodity prices, and a weighted-average cost of capital discount rate.\n•\nThe fair value of unproved properties was estimated mainly using the market approach, based on acreage costs in areas where Callon acreage was acquired.\n•\nThe fair value of most other current assets and current liabilities were determined to be equivalent to the carrying value due to their short-term nature.\n•\nThe fair value of debt was based on the estimated cost to retire Callon’s debt instruments.\n•\nEstimated deferred taxes were based on available information concerning the fair values assigned to acquired assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and tax-related carryforwards at the acquisition date.\nRefer to \nNote 2\n—\nAcquisitions\n \nand Divestitures\n for further detail regarding the Company’s fair value measurements recorded related to the Callon acquisition.\nAdditionally, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain non-core U.S. oil and gas producing properties in the Permian Basin. As a result of this agreement, a separate impairment analysis was performed for each of the assets within the disposal group. The analyses were based on the agreed-upon proceeds less costs to sell for the transaction, a Level 1 fair value measurement. The historical carrying value of the net assets to be divested exceeded the fair value implied by the expected net proceeds, resulting in an impairment totaling $\n315\n million on the Company’s proved properties in the U.S. Refer to \nNote 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures\n for more detail.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $\n11\n million and \nno\n asset impairments, respectively, in connection with fair value assessments.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s oil and gas segments primarily generate revenue from contracts with customers from the sale of its crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production volumes. In addition to APA-related production volumes, the Company also sells commodity volumes purchased from third parties to provide flexibility to fulfill sales obligations and commitments. Under these commodity sales contracts, the physical delivery of each unit of quantity represents a single, distinct performance obligation on behalf of the Company. Contract prices are determined based on market-indexed prices, adjusted for quality, transportation, and other market-reflective differentials. Revenue is measured by allocating an entirely variable market price to each performance obligation and recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. The Company considers a variety of facts and circumstances in assessing the point of control transfer, including but not limited to: whether the purchaser can direct the use of the hydrocarbons, the transfer of significant risks and rewards, and the Company’s right to payment. Control typically transfers to customers upon the physical delivery at specified locations within each contract and the transfer of title. \nAPA’s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production-sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the terms of the Company’s PSCs, the Company is the contractor partner (Contractor) with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and bears the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the Contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the Contractor’s income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractor under domestic law, are paid by EGPC on behalf of the Contractor out of EGPC’s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on the Company’s Egypt operations despite impacting the Company’s production and reserves. \nRefer to \nNote 16—Business Segment Information\n for a disaggregation of revenue by product and reporting segment.\nF-13\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nPayment Terms and Contract Balances\nReceivables from contracts with customers, including receivables for purchased oil and gas sales and net of allowance for credit losses, were $\n1.7\n billion and $\n1.5\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Payments under all contracts with customers are typically due and received within a short-term period of one year or less, after physical delivery of the product or service has been rendered. In the past year, the Company’s receivable balance from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) has gradually increased as payments for the Company’s Egyptian oil and gas sales have been delayed for periods longer than historically experienced. The Company is actively engaged in discussions with the Government of Egypt to resolve the delay in EGPC payments. The Company has received payments throughout 2024, and management believes that the Company will be able to collect the total balance of its receivables from this customer.\nIn accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” variable market prices for each short-term commodity sale are allocated entirely to each performance obligation as the terms of payment relate specifically to the Company’s efforts to satisfy its obligations. As such, the Company has elected the practical expedients available under the standard to not disclose the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, performance obligations as of the end of the reporting period.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $\n625\n million and $\n87\n million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. The Company had \nno\n restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are stated at amortized cost net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company routinely assesses the collectability of its financial assets measured at amortized cost. The Company monitors the credit quality of its counterparties through review of collections, credit ratings, and other analyses. The Company develops its estimated allowance for expected credit losses primarily using an aging method and analyses of historical loss rates as well as consideration of current and future conditions that could impact its counterparties’ credit quality and liquidity.\nThe following table presents changes to the Company’s allowance for credit loss:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nAllowance for credit loss at beginning of year\n$\n114\n \n$\n117\n \n$\n109\n \nAdditional provisions for the year\n9\n \n16\n \n9\n \nUncollectible accounts written off, net of recoveries\n—\n \n(\n19\n)\n(\n1\n)\nAllowance for credit loss at end of year\n$\n123\n \n$\n114\n \n$\n117\n \nInventories\nInventories consist principally of tubular goods and equipment and are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value. Oil produced but not sold, primarily in the North Sea, is also recorded to inventory and is stated at the lower of the cost to produce or net realizable value.\nDuring 2024, the Company recorded $\n18\n million of inventory impairments, including $\n13\n million in the North Sea and $\n5\n million in the U.S.\nThe Company also recorded other impairments during 2023 of approximately $\n50\n million in connection with valuations of drilling and operations equipment inventory upon the Company’s decision to suspend drilling operations in the North Sea.\nProperty and Equipment\nThe carrying value of the Company’s property and equipment represents the cost incurred to acquire the property and equipment, including capitalized interest, net of any impairments. For business combinations and acquisitions, property and equipment cost is based on the fair values at the acquisition date.\nF-14\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nOil and Gas Property\nThe Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas property. Under this method of accounting, exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, and exploration overhead, are expensed as incurred. All costs related to production, general corporate overhead, and similar activities are expensed as incurred. If an exploratory well provides evidence to justify potential development of reserves, drilling costs associated with the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities; in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.\nAcquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment at least annually and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment based on the Company’s current exploration plans. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged to exploration expense, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration costs in the statement of consolidated operations.\nThe following table represents non-cash impairment charges of the carrying value of the Company’s proved and unproved properties:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nProved properties:\nU.S.\n$\n315\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nEgypt\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nNorth Sea\n796\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal proved properties\n$\n1,111\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nUnproved properties:\nU.S.\n$\n34\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n20\n \nEgypt\n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \nNorth Sea\n—\n \n11\n \n—\n \nOther International\n1\n \n1\n \n—\n \nTotal unproved properties\n$\n35\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n24\n \nCosts to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production (UOP) method. The UOP calculation multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter by the carrying value of associated proved oil and gas properties. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. The reserve base used to calculate the depreciation for capitalized well costs is the sum of proved developed reserves only. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are included in the depreciable cost.\nOil and gas properties are grouped for depreciation in accordance with ASC 932, “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas.” The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.\nF-15\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nWhen circumstances indicate that the carrying value of proved oil and gas properties may not be recoverable, the Company compares unamortized capitalized costs to the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows for the associated assets grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows of other assets. If the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows, based on the Company’s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using the income approach described in ASC 820. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments, a Level 3 fair value measurement.\nThe change in cessation-of-production dates in the North Sea discussed above in “Fair Value Measurements” significantly altered the Company’s remaining oil and gas reserves in the North Sea and triggered an impairment assessment of the Company’s proved oil and gas properties at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Future production volumes and estimated future commodity prices are the largest drivers in variability of future cash flows. Expected cash flows were estimated based on management’s views of forward pricing as of the balance sheet dates. A discount rate based on a market-based weighted-average cost of capital estimate was applied to the undiscounted cash flow estimate to value the Company’s North Sea assets. In connection with this assessment, the Company recorded impairments totaling $\n796\n million on certain of the Company’s North Sea proved properties to an aggregate fair value of $\n263\n million.\nAdditionally, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain non-core U.S. oil and gas producing properties in the Permian Basin. As a result of this agreement, a separate impairment analysis was performed for each of the assets within the disposal group. The analyses were based on the agreed-upon proceeds less costs to sell for the transaction, a Level 1 fair value measurement. The historical carrying value of the net assets to be divested exceeded the fair value implied by the expected net proceeds, resulting in an impairment totaling $\n315\n million on the Company’s proved properties in the U.S. Refer to \nNote 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures\n for more detail.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded \nno\n impairments of proved properties.\nGains and losses on divestitures of the Company’s oil and gas properties are recognized in the statement of consolidated operations upon closing of the transaction.\n Refer to \nNote 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures\n for more detail.\nGathering, Processing, and Transmission (GPT) Facilities\nGPT facilities totaled $\n433\n million and $\n448\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with accumulated depreciation for these assets totaling $\n364\n million and $\n373\n million for the respective periods. GPT facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimation of useful life takes into consideration anticipated production lives from the fields serviced by the GPT assets, whether APA-operated or third party-operated, as well as potential development plans by the Company for undeveloped acreage within, or close to, those fields.\nThe Company assesses the carrying amount of its GPT facilities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of these facilities is more than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023,  and 2022, the Company recorded \nno\n impairments of GPT facilities.\nOther Property and Equipment\nOther property and equipment includes computer software and equipment, buildings, vehicles, furniture and fixtures, land, and other equipment. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from \n3\n to \n20\n years.\n Other property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation totaled $\n183\n million and $\n217\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAsset Retirement Costs and Obligations\nThe initial estimated asset retirement obligation related to property and equipment and subsequent revisions are recorded as a liability at fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from changes in estimated inflation rates, changes in service and equipment costs and changes in the estimated timing of an asset’s retirement. Asset retirement costs are depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment. Accretion expense on the liability is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related assets.\nF-16\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nCapitalized\n \nInterest\nFor significant projects, interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets. Significant oil and gas investments in unproved properties actively being explored, significant exploration and development projects that have not commenced production, significant midstream development activities that are in progress, and investments in equity method affiliates that are undergoing the construction of assets that have not commenced principal operations qualify for interest capitalization. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Company’s weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred. Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is expensed through depreciation.\n \nEquity Method Interests\nThe Company follows the equity method of accounting when it does not exercise control over its equity interests, but can exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the entity. Under this method, the equity interests are carried originally at acquisition cost, increased by the Company’s proportionate share of the equity interest’s net income and contributions made by the Company, and decreased by the Company’s proportionate share of the equity interest’s net losses and distributions received by the Company. Refer to \nNote 6—Equity Method Interests\n for further details of the Company’s equity method interests.\nEquity method interests are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred, if the loss is deemed to be other than temporary. When the loss is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in income.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAccruals for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, environmental, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change.\n For more information regarding loss contingencies, refer to \nNote 11—Commitments and Contingencies\n.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price, interest rate, and/or foreign exchange risk. These derivative contracts, which are generally placed with major financial institutions, may take the form of forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, or options.\nAll derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, are recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments. As a result, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments are reported in current-period income as “Derivative instrument gains (losses), net” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations.\n Refer to \nNote 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n for further information. \nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns. The Company routinely assesses the ability to realize its deferred tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and changing tax laws.\n Refer to \nNote 10—Income Taxes\n for further information.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company’s basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, which assumes that options were exercised and restricted stock was fully vested.\nF-17\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants various types of stock-based awards including stock options, restricted stock, cash-settled restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. Stock compensation equity awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed over the required vesting service period. Cash-settled awards are recorded as a liability based on the Company’s stock price and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the vesting terms. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures.\n The Company’s stock-based compensation plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in \nNote 13—Capital Stock\n.\nTreasury Stock\nThe Company follows the weighted-average-cost method of accounting for treasury stock transactions.\nTransaction, Reorganization, and Separation (TRS)\nThe Company recorded TRS costs in 2024 totaling $\n168\n million, which primarily comprised $\n147\n million associated with the Callon acquisition, including $\n76\n million of separation costs and $\n71\n million of transaction and integration costs.\nThe Company recorded TRS costs in 2023 and 2022 totaling $\n15\n million and $\n26\n million, respectively, including $\n7\n million and $\n15\n million, respectively, related to consulting and separation costs in international operations associated with the redesign of the Company’s organizational structure and operations.\nNew Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740),” which requires enhanced disclosures primarily related to existing rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2025 and is applied on a prospective basis. The Company does not believe this will have a material impact on its financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40),” which expands disclosures around a public entity’s costs and expenses of specific items (i.e. employee compensation, DD&A), requires the inclusion of amounts that are required to be disclosed under GAAP in the same disclosure as other disaggregation requirements, requires qualitative descriptions of amounts remaining in expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively, and requires disclosure of total selling expenses, and in annual periods, the definition of selling expenses. The amendment does not change or remove existing disclosure requirements. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendment can be adopted prospectively or retrospectively to any or all periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard.\n \n2.   \nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n2024 Activity\nCallon Petroleum Company Acquisition\nOn April 1, 2024, APA completed its acquisition of Callon in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $\n4.5\n billion, inclusive of Callon’s debt. The transaction was approved by APA and Callon shareholders at special meetings held on March 27, 2024. The acquired assets include approximately \n120,000\n net acres in the Delaware Basin and \n25,000\n net acres in the Midland Basin.\nSubject to the terms of the merger agreement (Merger Agreement), each share of Callon common stock was converted into the right to receive \n1.0425\n shares of APA common stock, with cash in lieu of fractional shares. As a result, APA issued approximately \n70\n million shares of APA common stock in connection with the transaction based on the value of APA common stock on the day of closing, and following the acquisition, Callon common stock is no longer listed for trading on the NYSE. In addition to the equity consideration provided, APA transferred approximately $\n24\n million in other consideration upon close of the transaction.\nUpon completing the acquisition, APA repaid all of Callon’s debt, refinancing a portion by borrowing $\n1.5\n billion under its unsecured committed term loan facility. Refer to \nNote 9—Debt and Financing Costs\n for further detail.\nF-18\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nRecording of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\nThe transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.\n(In millions)\nCurrent assets\n$\n287\n \nProperty and equipment\n4,502\n \nDeferred tax asset\n565\n \nOther assets\n12\n \nTotal assets acquired\n$\n5,366\n \nCurrent liabilities\n$\n632\n \nLong-term debt\n2,113\n \nAsset retirement obligation\n136\n \nOther long-term obligations\n48\n \nTotal liabilities assumed\n$\n2,929\n \nNet assets acquired\n$\n2,437\n \nThe following unaudited pro forma combined results for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 reflect the consolidated results of operations of the Company as if the Callon acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2023.

The unaudited pro forma results are also not intended to be a projection of future results and do not include any future cost savings or other synergies that may result from the Callon acquisition or any estimated costs that have not yet been incurred.\nU.S. Divestitures\nOn December 31, 2024, APA completed the sale of non-core producing properties in the Permian Basin that had a carrying value of $\n1.1\n billion and associated asset retirement obligation of $\n224\n million for total cash proceeds of $\n869\n million after closing adjustments. The properties are located in the Central Basin Platform, Texas and New Mexico Shelf, and Northwest Shelf. The effective date of the transaction is July 1, 2024. As a result of the transaction, the Company performed a fair value assessment of the associated assets and liabilities and recorded an impairment of $\n315\n million to the carrying value of the associated oil and gas properties during the third quarter of 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a loss of $\n5\n million upon closing of the transaction.\nDuring 2024, the Company completed the sale of non-core acreage in the East Texas Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford plays that had a carrying value of $\n347\n million for aggregate cash proceeds of $\n255\n million and the assumption of asset retirement obligations of $\n42\n million. The Company recognized a $\n50\n million loss during 2024 in association with this sale.\nDuring 2024, the Company also completed the sale of non-core mineral and royalty interests in the Permian Basin that had a carrying value of $\n71\n million for approximately $\n394\n million subject to post-closing adjustments. The Company recognized a gain of $\n321\n million during 2024 in association with this sale.\nF-19\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nAdditionally, during 2024, the Company completed the sale of non-core assets and leasehold in multiple transactions for aggregate cash proceeds of $\n91\n million, recognizing a gain of approximately $\n22\n million upon closing of these transactions.\nSale of Kinetik Shares\nOn March 18, 2024, the Company sold its remaining Kinetik Class A Common Stock (Kinetik Shares) for cash proceeds of $\n428\n million. Refer to \nNote 6—Equity Method Interests\n for further detail.\nLeasehold and Property Acquisitions\nDuring 2024, in addition to the Callon acquisition, the Company completed other leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $\n60\n million.\n2023 Activity\nSale of Kinetik Shares\nIn December 2023, the Company sold \n7.5\n million of its Kinetik Shares for cash proceeds of $\n228\n million. Refer to \nNote 6—Equity Method Interests\n for further detail.\nLeasehold and Property Acquisitions\nDuring 2023, the Company completed leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of approximately $\n20\n million.\nU.S. Divestitures\nDuring 2023, the Company completed the sale of non-core assets and leasehold in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $\n29\n million, recognizing an aggregate gain of approximately $\n8\n million upon closing of these transactions.\n2022 Activity\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Company closed on the acquisition of oil and gas assets in the Delaware Basin for a total purchase price of $\n615\n million after post-closing adjustments. Final cash settlements of $\n24\n million were completed during 2023. The Company recorded $\n581\n million for proved properties, $\n38\n million for unproved leasehold, and $\n4\n million for abandonment obligations.\nDuring 2022, the Company completed other leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of approximately $\n37\n million.\nDuring 2022, the Company completed the sale of non-core assets and leasehold in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $\n52\n million, recognizing an aggregate gain of approximately $\n36\n million, upon closing of these transactions.\nDuring 2022, the Company completed the sale of certain non-core mineral rights in the Delaware Basin. The Company received total cash proceeds of approximately $\n726\n million after certain post-closing adjustments and recognized an associated gain of approximately $\n560\n million.\nThe BCP Business Combination was completed on February 22, 2022. As consideration for the contribution of the Contributed Interests, ALTM issued \n50\n million shares of Class C Common Stock (and Altus Midstream LP issued a corresponding number of common units) to BCP’s unitholders, which are principally funds affiliated with Blackstone and I Squared Capital. ALTM’s stockholders continued to hold their existing shares of common stock. As a result of the transaction, the Contributor, or its designees, collectively owned approximately \n75\n percent of the issued and outstanding shares of ALTM common stock. Apache Midstream LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of APA, which owned approximately \n79\n percent of the issued and outstanding shares of ALTM common stock prior to the BCP Business Combination, owned approximately \n20\n percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Kinetik common stock after the transaction closed.\nAs a result of the BCP Business Combination, the Company deconsolidated ALTM on February 22, 2022 and recognized a gain of approximately $\n609\n million that reflects the difference between the Company’s $\n193\n million net effect of deconsolidating ALTM’s balance sheet and the $\n802\n million fair value of the Company’s approximate \n20\n percent retained ownership in the combined entity.\nF-20\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, the Company sold \nfour million\n of its Kinetik Shares for cash proceeds of $\n224\n million.

Management is actively pursuing efforts to assess whether reserves can be attributed to these projects. Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since completion of drilling were $\n130\n million at December 31, 2024, with $\n115\n million related to Suriname exploration and appraisal. Ongoing analysis of well results and appraisal activity is continuing. The remaining projects pertain to onshore drilling activity in Egypt for which continued testing and evaluation is being performed. \nDry hole expenses from suspended exploratory well costs previously capitalized for greater than one year at December 31, 2023 totaled $\n52\n million. These expenses pertained to projects in Suriname and Egypt.\nThe following table summarizes aging by geographic area of those exploratory well costs that, as of December 31, 2024, have been capitalized for a period greater than one year, categorized by the year in which drilling was completed:\nTotal\n2023\n2022\n2021\nand Prior\n(In millions)\nSuriname\n$\n115\n \n$\n60\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n55\n \nEgypt\n15\n \n15\n \n—\n \n—\n \n$\n130\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n55\n \nF-21\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n4.    \nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nObjectives and Strategies\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production, as well as fluctuations in exchange rates in connection with transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Company manages the variability in its cash flows by occasionally entering into derivative transactions on a portion of its crude oil and natural gas production and foreign currency transactions. The Company utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, and options, to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. The Company elected not to designate any of its derivative contracts as cash flow hedges.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nAs a result of the Callon acquisition, the Company assumed an earn-out obligation from Callon, where the Company could be required to pay up to $\n25\n million in the aggregate if the average daily settlement price of WTI crude oil exceeds $\n60.00\n per barrel for the 2025 calendar year. The Company determined that the earn-out obligation is not clearly and closely related to the underlying agreements and therefore bifurcated this embedded feature and recorded the derivative at fair value. The Company uses a market approach to estimate the fair values of these derivatives on a recurring basis, utilizing an option pricing model method provided by a reputable third party. The valuation includes significant inputs such as forward oil price curves, time to expiration, and implied volatility. As these inputs are substantially observable for the full term of the contingent consideration arrangements, the inputs are considered a Level 2 fair value measurement.\nDerivative Activity Recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nAll derivative instruments are reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. These fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions where counterparty master netting arrangements contain provisions for net settlement. \nThe carrying value of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities and their locations on the consolidated balance sheet are as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCurrent Assets: Other current assets\n$\n—\n \n$\n6\n \nTotal derivative assets\n$\n—\n \n$\n6\n \nDeferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities: Other\n$\n18\n \n$\n—\n \nTotal derivative liabilities\n$\n18\n \n$\n—\n \nDerivative Activity Recorded in the Statement of Consolidated Operations\nThe following table summarizes the effect of derivative instruments on the Company’s statement of consolidated operations:\n \nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nRealized:\nCommodity derivative instruments\n$\n2\n \n$\n48\n \n$\n(\n34\n)\nContingent consideration arrangements\n(\n4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nForeign currency derivative instruments\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n13\n)\nRealized gains (losses), net\n(\n2\n)\n48\n \n(\n47\n)\nUnrealized:\nCommodity derivative instruments\n(\n6\n)\n51\n \n(\n36\n)\nContingent consideration arrangements\n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nPreferred Units embedded derivative\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n31\n)\nUnrealized gains (losses), net\n(\n8\n)\n51\n \n(\n67\n)\nDerivative instrument gains (losses), net\n$\n(\n10\n)\n$\n99\n \n$\n(\n114\n)\nF-22\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nDerivative instrument gains and losses are recorded in “Derivative instrument gains (losses), net” under “Revenues and Other” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.

The Company elected the fair value option for measuring its equity method interest in Kinetik. The fair value of the Company’s interest in Kinetik was determined using observable share prices on a major exchange, a Level 1 fair value measurement. On March 18, 2024, the Company sold its remaining Kinetik Shares for cash proceeds of $\n428\n million.\nPrior to the Company’s sale of its remaining Kinetik Shares and the resignation of the Company’s designated director from the Kinetik board of directors, the Company recorded changes in the fair value of its equity method interest in Kinetik totaling a loss of $\n9\n million during 2024, and gains of $\n41\n million and $\n72\n million during 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. The Company estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate, and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property or other long-lived asset balance.\nDuring 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $\n15\n million and $\n14\n million, respectively, in abandonment liabilities resulting from the Company’s exploration and development capital program. Liabilities settled primarily relate to individual properties, platforms, and facilities plugged and abandoned during the period. During 2024, net abandonment costs were revised upward by approximately $\n299\n million, primarily reflecting changes in estimates of timing and activity costs in the U.S. and North Sea, in addition to foreign currency exchange rates on service costs. During 2023, net abandonment costs were revised upward by approximately $\n356\n million to reflect changes in estimates of timing, activity costs, and foreign currency exchange rates on service costs in the North Sea\n.\nF-24\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n9.    \nDEBT AND FINANCING COSTS\nOverview\nThe debt of APA and Apache is senior unsecured debt and has equal priority with respect to the payment of both principal and interest. As of December 31, 2024, (i) all indentures of Apache for the notes and debentures described below placed certain restrictions on Apache, including limits on Apache’s ability to incur debt secured by certain liens, and (ii) certain of those indentures also restricted Apache’s ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and gave holders the option to require Apache to repurchase outstanding notes and debentures upon certain changes in control. Each indenture of APA and Apache restricts it from issuing or guaranteeing certain secured indebtedness. None of the indentures contain prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.\nDuring 2023, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $\n74\n million for an aggregate purchase price of $\n65\n million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a discount to par of an aggregate $\n10\n million. The Company recognized a $\n9\n million gain on these repurchases. The repurchases were partially financed by Apache’s borrowing under the Company’s US dollar-denominated revolving credit facility.\nDuring 2022, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $\n15\n million for an aggregate purchase price of $\n16\n million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a premium to par of an aggregate $\n1\n million. The Company recognized a $\n1\n million loss on these repurchases. The repurchases were partially financed by borrowing under Apache’s former revolving credit facility.\nDuring 2022, Apache closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes issued under its indentures, accepting for purchase $\n1.1\n billion aggregate principal amount of notes. Apache paid holders an aggregate $\n1.2\n billion in cash, reflecting principal, premium to par, and accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recognized a $\n66\n million loss on extinguishment of debt, including $\n11\n million of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs in connection with the note purchases. The repurchases were partially financed by borrowing under Apache’s former revolving credit facility.\nThe Company records gains and losses on extinguishment of debt in “Financing costs, net” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.\nF-25\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe following table presents the carrying value of the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n \nDecember 31,        \n \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\n4.625\n% notes due 2025\n(1)\n$\n51\n \n$\n51\n \n7.7\n% notes due 2026\n78\n \n78\n \n7.95\n% notes due 2026\n132\n \n132\n \n4.875\n% notes due 2027\n(1)\n108\n \n108\n \n4.375\n% notes due 2028\n(1)\n325\n \n325\n \n7.75\n% notes due 2029\n(1)(2)\n235\n \n235\n \n4.25\n% notes due 2030\n(1)\n516\n \n516\n \n6.0\n% notes due 2037\n(1)\n443\n \n443\n \n5.1\n% notes due 2040\n(1)\n1,333\n \n1,333\n \n5.25\n% notes due 2042\n(1)\n399\n \n399\n \n4.75\n% notes due 2043\n(1)\n428\n \n428\n \n4.25\n% notes due 2044\n(1)\n211\n \n211\n \n7.375\n% debentures due 2047\n150\n \n150\n \n5.35\n% notes due 2049\n(1)\n387\n \n387\n \n7.625\n% debentures due 2096\n39\n \n39\n \nApache notes and debentures before unamortized discount and debt issuance costs\n(3)\n4,835\n \n4,835\n \nCommercial paper\n323\n \n—\n \nTerm loan facility\n900\n \n—\n \nSyndicated credit facilities\n(4)\n10\n \n372\n \nApache finance lease obligations\n30\n \n32\n \nUnamortized discount\n(\n25\n)\n(\n26\n)\nDebt issuance costs\n(\n29\n)\n(\n25\n)\nTotal debt\n6,044\n \n5,188\n \nCurrent maturities\n(\n53\n)\n(\n2\n)\nLong-term debt\n$\n5,991\n \n$\n5,186\n \n(1)\nThese notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apache’s option, subject to a make-whole premium, except that the \n7.75\n% notes due 2029 are only redeemable as whole for principal and accrued interest in the event of certain Canadian tax law changes.

As of December 31, 2024, there were \nno\n letters of credit outstanding under the USD Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there were $\n372\n million of borrowings under the 2022 USD Agreement, and an aggregate £\n348\n million in letters of credit outstanding under the GBP Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there were \nno\n letters of credit outstanding under the 2022 USD Agreement.\nThe Company was in compliance with the terms of the 2022 Agreements as of December 31, 2024. \nUncommitted Lines of Credit\nEach of the Company and Apache from time to time has and uses uncommitted credit and letter of credit facilities for working capital and credit support purposes. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were \nno\n outstanding borrowings under these facilities. As of December 31, 2024, there were £\n640\n million and $\n11\n million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities. As of December 31, 2023, there were £\n416\n million and $\n2\n million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities.\nCommercial Paper Program\n \nIn December 2023, the Company established a commercial paper program under which it from time to time may issue in private placements exempt from registration under the Securities Act short-term unsecured promissory notes (the CP Notes) up to a maximum aggregate face amount of $\n1.8\n billion outstanding at any time. The maturities of CP Notes may vary but may not exceed \n397\n days from the date of issuance. Outstanding CP Notes are supported by available borrowing capacity under the Company’s committed revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes, which as of December 31, 2024, included the $\n1.8\n billion 2022 USD Agreement.\nPayment of the CP Notes has been unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Apache, such guarantee effective until the first time that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures is less than US$\n1.0\n billion.\nThe CP Notes are sold under customary market terms in the U.S. commercial paper market at a discount from par or at par and bear interest at rates determined at the time of issuance.\nF-27\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had $\n323\n million in aggregate face amount of CP Notes outstanding, which is classified as long-term debt. As of December 31, 2023, there were \nno\n CP Notes outstanding.\nUnsecured Committed Term Loan Facility\nOn January 30, 2024, APA entered into a syndicated credit agreement under which the lenders committed an aggregate $\n2.0\n billion for senior unsecured delayed-draw term loans to APA (Term Loan Credit Agreement), the proceeds of which could be used to refinance certain indebtedness of Callon only once upon the date of the closings under the Merger Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement. Of such aggregate commitments, $\n1.5\n billion was for term loans that would mature \nthree years\n after the date of such closings (\n3\n-Year Tranche Loans) and $\n500\n million was for term loans that would mature \n364\n days after the date of such closings (\n364\n-Day Tranche Loans). Apache has guaranteed obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement effective until the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures first is less than $\n1.0\n billion.\nOn April 1, 2024 (the Closing Date), APA closed the transactions under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, electing to borrow an aggregate $\n1.5\n billion in \n3\n-Year Tranche Loans maturing April 1, 2027 and to allow the lender commitments for the \n364\n-Day Tranche Loans to expire. As of December 31, 2024, $\n900\n million in \n3\n-Year Tranche Loans remained outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nLoan proceeds were used to refinance certain indebtedness of Callon upon the substantially simultaneous closing of APA’s acquisition of Callon pursuant to the Merger Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses. APA may at any time prepay loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. \nBorrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement bear interest at one of two rate options selected by APA, being either (i) an alternate base rate (as defined), plus a margin (Term Base Rate Margin) varying from \n0.375\n% to \n1.125\n% for \n3\n-Year Tranche Loans until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and \n0.625\n% to \n1.375\n% for \n3\n-Year Tranche Loans after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, or (ii) an adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined), plus a margin (Term Applicable Margin) varying from \n1.375\n% to \n2.125\n% for \n3\n-Year Tranche Loans until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and \n1.625\n% to \n2.375\n% for \n3\n-Year Tranche Loans after the second anniversary of the Closing Date.\nMargins are at varying rates per annum determined by reference to the senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money of APA, or if such indebtedness is not rated and the Apache guaranty is in effect, of Apache (Long-Term Debt Rating). As of December 31, 2024, Apache’s Long-Term Debt Rating applied, and the Term Base Rate Margin was \n0.75\n% for \n3\n-Year Tranche Loans, and the Term Applicable Margin was \n1.75\n% for \n3\n-Year Tranche Loans. \nAPA is subject to representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, such as:\n•\nA financial covenant requires APA to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than \n60\n percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2024, APA’s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the Term Loan Credit Agreement was \n19\n percent.\n•\nA negative covenant restricts the ability of APA and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with customary exceptions and exceptions for liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the U.S. and Canada. Liens on assets also are permitted if debt secured thereby does not exceed \n15\n percent of APA’s consolidated net tangible assets or approximately $\n2.5\n billion as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nNegative covenants restrict APA’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, a borrower’s disposition of substantially all of its assets, prohibitions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to make payments to borrowers, and guarantees by APA or certain subsidiaries of debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.\n•\nLenders may accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending commitments for nonpayment and other breaches; if APA or certain subsidiaries default on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold, or has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold; or APA undergoes a specified change in control. Such acceleration and termination are automatic upon specified insolvency events of APA or certain subsidiaries.\nF-28\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe Term Loan Credit Agreement does not permit lenders to accelerate maturity based on unspecified material adverse changes and does not have prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.\nThe Company was in compliance with the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.\nSubsequent Event—Unsecured 2025 Committed Bank Credit Facilities\nOn January 15, 2025, the Company terminated commitments under the 2022 Agreements and in replacement thereof, entered into \ntwo\n unsecured syndicated credit agreements for general corporate purposes on terms substantially the same as those of the 2022 Agreements:\n•\nOne\n agreement is denominated in US dollars (the 2025 USD Agreement) and provides for an unsecured \nfive-year\n revolving credit facility for loans and letters of credit, with aggregate commitments of US$\n2.0\n billion (including a letter of credit subfacility of up to US$\n750\n million, of which US$\n250\n million currently is committed). APA may increase commitments up to an aggregate US$\n2.5\n billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. This facility matures in January 2030, subject to the Company’s \ntwo\n, \none-year\n extension options.\n•\nThe second agreement is denominated in pounds sterling (the 2025 GBP Agreement) and provides for an unsecured \nfive-year\n revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of £\n1.5\n billion for loans and letters of credit. This facility matures in January 2030, subject to the Company’s \ntwo\n, \none-year\n extension options.\nApache has guaranteed obligations under each of the 2025 USD Agreement and 2025 GBP Agreement (each, a 2025 Agreement) effective until the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures first is less than US$\n1.0\n billion.\nLetters of credit are available under each 2025 Agreement for credit support needs of APA and its subsidiaries, including in respect of North Sea decommissioning obligations. As of January 15, 2025, letters of credit aggregating approximately £\n253\n million originally issued under the 2022 GBP Agreement were deemed issued and outstanding under the 2025 GBP Agreement.\nAll borrowings under the 2025 USD Agreement bear interest at one of two per annum rate options selected by the borrower, being either an alternate base rate (as defined), plus a margin varying from \n0.0\n% to \n0.675\n% (Base Rate Margin), or an adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined), plus a margin varying from \n1.00\n% to \n1.675\n% (Applicable Margin). All borrowings under the 2025 GBP Agreement bear interest with respect to any business day at an adjusted rate per annum determined by reference to the Sterling Overnight Index Average with respect to such business day published by the Bank of England, plus the Applicable Margin.\nEach 2025 Agreement also requires the borrower to pay quarterly (i) a facility fee on total commitments at a per annum rate that varies from \n0.125\n% to \n0.325\n% and (ii) a commission on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect.  Customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks.\nMargins and facility fees are at varying rates per annum determined by reference to the senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money of APA, or if such indebtedness is not rated and the Apache guaranty is in effect, of Apache (Long-Term Debt Rating). APA’s Long-Term Debt Rating currently applies, and the Base Rate Margin is \n0.30\n%, the Applicable Margin is \n1.30\n%, and the facility fee is \n0.20\n%.\nBorrowers under each 2025 Agreement, which include certain subsidiaries of APA, may borrow, prepay, and reborrow loans and obtain letters of credit, and APA may obtain letters of credit for the account of its subsidiaries, in each case subject to representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default, such as:\n•\nA financial covenant requires APA to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than \n65\n% at the end of any fiscal quarter.\n•\nA negative covenant restricts the ability of APA and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with customary exceptions and exceptions for liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the U. S. and Canada; Liens on assets also are permitted if debt secured thereby does not exceed \n15\n% of APA’s consolidated net tangible assets.\nF-29\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n•\nNegative covenants restrict APA’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, a borrower’s disposition of substantially all of its assets, prohibitions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to make payments to borrowers, and guarantees by APA or certain subsidiaries of debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.\n•\nLenders may accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches; if a borrower or certain subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold, or has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold; or APA undergoes a specified change in control. Such acceleration and termination are automatic upon specified insolvency events of a borrower or certain subsidiaries.\nThe 2025 Agreements do not require collateral, do not have a borrowing base, do not permit lenders to accelerate maturity or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes, and do not have borrowing restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.\nSubsequent Event—APA Exchange and Tender Offers for Apache Indenture Debt\nOn January 10, 2025, the Company settled its private exchange and cash tender offers for certain notes and debentures issued by Apache under its indentures. The Company also then settled its private offering of new notes to fund in part its purchase of Apache notes in APA’s cash tender offers.  In settling these offerings pursuant to their respective terms:\n•\nA\nPA issued new notes and debentures under its indentures in aggregate principal amounts of (i) $\n2.5\n billion in exchange for Apache notes and debentures tendered and accepted in APA’s exchange offers, (ii) $\n203\n million in exchange for Apache notes tendered in the cash tender offers in excess of the stated maximum purchase amount or series caps, and (iii) $\n850\n million in the new notes offering, comprised of $\n350\n million aggregate principal amount of APA’s \n6.10\n% Notes due 2035 and $\n500\n million aggregate principal amount of APA’s \n6.75\n% Notes due 2055.\n•\nIn addition to issuing the APA notes in the exchange offers, APA paid a total of $\n2.5\n million in cash as part of the exchange consideration.\n•\nAPA paid a total of $\n869\n million in cash in the tender offers (comprised of tender offer consideration, exchange consideration for tendered notes exchanged, early participation premium, and accrued interest) for the aggregate $\n1\n billion in principal amount of Apache notes tendered and accepted in the cash tender offers.\n•\nNet proceeds from the sale of the notes in APA’s new notes offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $\n839\n million and used to fund in part APA’s purchase of Apache notes in APA’s cash tender offers.\n•\nEach series of APA notes and debentures issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers has the same interest rate, maturity date, and interest payment dates and the same optional redemption prices (if any) as the corresponding series of Apache notes and debentures for which they were exchanged.\n•\nEach series of APA notes and debentures issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers and new notes offering are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache until the first time that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures is less than $\n1\n billion.\n•\nAPA entered into two registration rights agreements, one covering notes and debentures issued in APA’s exchange and tender offers and one covering notes issued in APA’s new notes offering (each a Registration Rights Agreement). These offerings were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), in reliance upon an exemption therefrom, and the APA notes and debentures issued pursuant to such offers are subject to certain transfer restrictions. Each Registration Rights Agreement requires APA and Apache to use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be filed a registration statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange each series of APA notes issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers or new notes offering, as applicable, for registered notes issued by APA and guaranteed, if applicable, by Apache containing terms substantially identical in all material respects to the applicable series of APA notes issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers or new notes offering (except that the registered notes will not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions or any increase in annual interest rate) and (ii) cause such registration statement to become effective under the Securities Act.  If, among other events, such exchange offers are not completed on or prior to the 360th day following January 10, 2025, then additional interest will accrue on the principal amount of such registrable securities at a rate of \n0.25\n% per annum for \nF-30\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nthe first 90-day period beginning on the day immediately following such registration default (which rate will be increased by an additional \n0.25\n% per annum for each subsequent 90-day period that such additional interest continues to accrue, provided that the rate at which such additional interest accrues may in no event exceed \n1.00\n% per annum). To the extent Apache’s guarantee of the registrable securities is terminated in accordance with the terms of such guarantee, the registered notes will not be guaranteed by Apache, the exchange offer and registration requirements with respect thereto will be the sole obligation of the Company, and Apache will automatically be released from all obligations under the applicable Registration Rights Agreement.\nThe following table presents the aggregate principal amounts of notes and debentures outstanding under indentures of APA and Apache on January 10, 2025 upon settlement of the APA’s exchange and tender offers and new notes offering (Apache notes due 2025 were not included in APA’s exchange or tender offers):\nJanuary 10, 2025\nAPA\nApache\n(In millions)\n4.625\n% notes due 2025\n$\n—\n \n$\n51\n \n7.7\n% notes due March 2026\n(1)(5)(6)\n58\n \n21\n \n7.95\n% notes due April 2026\n(1)(5)(6)\n56\n \n76\n \n4.875\n% notes due 2027\n(4)(5)(6)\n39\n \n69\n \n4.375\n% notes due 2028\n(4)(5)(6)\n239\n \n86\n \n7.75\n% notes due 2029\n(2)(5)(6)\n164\n \n72\n \n4.25\n% notes due 2030\n(4)(5)(6)\n374\n \n142\n \n6.0\n% notes due 2037\n(1)(5)(6)\n341\n \n102\n \n5.1\n% notes due 2040\n(1)(5)(6)\n539\n \n225\n \n5.25\n% notes due 2042\n(1)(5)(6)\n209\n \n65\n \n4.75\n% notes due 2043\n(3)(5)(6)\n153\n \n79\n \n4.25\n% notes due 2044\n(3)(5)(6)\n77\n \n24\n \n7.375\n% debentures due 2047\n(1)(5)(6)\n126\n \n24\n \n5.35\n% notes due 2049\n(4)(5)(6)\n330\n \n57\n \n7.625\n% debentures due 2096\n(1)(5)(6)\n37\n \n2\n \n6.1\n% notes due 2035\n(7)\n350\n \n—\n \n6.75\n% notes due 2055\n(7)\n500\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n3,592\n \n$\n1,095\n \n(1)\nThe Apache March 2026 notes, the Apache April 2026 notes, the Apache 2037 notes, the Apache 2040 notes, the Apache 2042 notes, the Apache 2047 debentures, and the Apache 2096 debentures were issued under the Senior Indenture, dated as of February 15, 1996, between Apache and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee), as trustee (an Apache Indenture).\n(2)\nThe Apache 2029 notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of November 23, 1999, between Apache (as successor to Apache Finance Canada Corporation), and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.

The Apache notes and debentures are senior unsecured obligations of Apache. Apache received consents sufficient to approve the proposed amendments to the Apache Indentures with respect to the Apache March 2026 notes,  the Apache 2028 notes, the Apache 2029 notes, the Apache 2030 notes, the Apache 2037 notes, the Apache 2040 notes, the Apache 2042 notes, the Apache 2043 notes, the Apache 2044 notes, the Apache 2047 debentures, the Apache 2049 notes, and the Apache 2096 debentures. As a result, Apache and the respective trustee for the Apache Indentures entered into supplemental indentures on January 10, 2025, implementing the proposed amendments effective as of that date.\n(6)\nThe APA March 2026 notes, the APA April 2026 notes, the APA 2027 notes, the APA 2028 notes, the APA 2029 notes, the APA 2030 notes, the APA 2037 notes, the APA 2040 notes, the APA 2042 notes, the APA 2043 notes, the APA 2044 notes, the APA 2047 debentures, the APA 2049 notes, and the APA 2096 debentures were issued under the Indenture, dated as of June 30, 2021, between the Company, as issuer, and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee.

The Company’s deferred tax asset increased by approximately $\n565\n million as part of the assets assumed through the Callon acquisition. Refer to \nNote 2— Acquisitions and Divestitures\n for further detail.\nOn July 14, 2022, the Energy (Oil and Gas) Profits Levy Act of 2022 (the Energy Profits Levy) was enacted, receiving Royal Assent. Under the law, an additional levy was assessed at a 25 percent rate, effective for the period of May 26, 2022 through December 31, 2025. The Finance Act 2023 included amendments to the Energy Profits Levy that increased the levy from a 25 percent rate to a 35 percent rate, effective for the period of January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2028. As a result, the Company recorded a deferred tax expense of $\n174\n million and $\n208\n million related to the remeasurement of the U.K. deferred tax liability in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA includes a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on applicable corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income that exceeds $1.0 billion for any three consecutive years preceding the tax year at issue. The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company became an applicable corporation subject to CAMT beginning on January 1, 2024. On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations relating to the application and implementation of CAMT. In 2024, the Company accrued tax expense of $\n74\n million, which results in a tax credit that can be carried forward indefinitely to offset regular federal income tax expense in subsequent years. \nIn December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development issued Pillar Two Model Rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15 percent on a country-by-country basis, with certain aspects effective in certain jurisdictions on January 1, 2024. Although the Company continues to monitor enacted legislation to implement these rules in countries where the Company could be impacted, the Company does not expect that the Pillar Two framework will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \nOn January 14, 2022, Apache Midstream LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Apache, exchanged \n12.5\n million Common Units in Altus Midstream LP for \n12.5\n million shares of ALTM Class A Common Stock, in a taxable exchange. On February 22, 2022, as a result of the BCP Business Combination, the Company deconsolidated ALTM. On March 11, 2022, the Company sold \nfour million\n of its Kinetik Shares, and on March 18, 2024, the remaining Kinetik Shares were sold. In 2022, the Company recorded tax expense of $\n126\n million associated with the BCP Business Combination. The tax impact of the BCP Business Combination was fully offset by a change in valuation allowance. Refer to \nNote 2— Acquisitions and Divestitures\n for further detail.\nDeferred tax assets are recorded for future deductible amounts and certain other tax benefits, such as net operating losses, tax credits and other tax attributes, provided that the Company assesses the utilization of such assets to be “more likely than not.” The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the existing deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, the Company has recorded valuation allowances for certain net operating losses, foreign tax credits and capital loss carryforwards that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, as a result of increases in projections of future taxable income and the absence of objective negative evidence such as a cumulative loss in recent years, the Company determined there was sufficient positive evidence to release a majority of the U.S. valuation allowance, which resulted in a non-cash deferred income tax benefit of $\n1.7\n billion.\nF-34\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nIn 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company’s valuation allowance decreased by $\n7\n million, $\n2.3\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion, respectively, as detailed in the table below:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n2,630\n \n$\n4,918\n \n$\n5,902\n \nState\n(1)\n(\n51\n)\n(\n63\n)\n(\n111\n)\nU.S.\n26\n \n(\n2,235\n)\n(\n706\n)\nForeign\n18\n \n10\n \n(\n167\n)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n2,623\n \n$\n2,630\n \n$\n4,918\n \n(1)\nReported as a component of state income taxes.\nOn December 31, 2024, the Company had net operating losses as follows:\n \nAmount    \nExpiration    \n \n(In millions)\n \nU.S.\n$\n10,345\n \n2028 - Indefinite\nState\n6,586\n \nVarious\nForeign\n153\n \n2025 - Indefinite\nThe Company has a U.S. net operating loss carryforward of $\n10.3\n billion, which includes $\n2.1\n billion of net operating loss subject to annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after 2017 are subject to an 80 percent taxable income limitation with indefinite carryover under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company also has state net operating losses of $\n6.6\n billion, foreign net operating losses of $\n153\n million, and a net interest expense carryover of $\n1.3\n billion under Section 163(j) of the Code with indefinite carryover. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against some of the U.S. net operating losses, a majority of the state net operating losses, the foreign net operating losses, and the U.S. capital loss because it is more likely than not that these net operating losses and the capital loss carryforward will not be realized. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to the remaining U.S. and state net operating losses, and the net interest expense carryover will be utilized prior to their expiration.\nOn December 31, 2024, the Company had foreign tax credits as follows:\n \nAmount    \nExpiration    \n \n(In millions)\n \nForeign tax credits\n$\n2,204\n \n2025-2026\nThe Company has a $\n2.2\n billion U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the U.S. foreign tax credits listed above because it is more likely than not that these attributes will expire unutilized.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions generally refer to a position taken in a previously filed income tax return or expected to be included in a tax return to be filed in the future that is reflected in the measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. \nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n93\n \n$\n89\n \n$\n116\n \nAdditions based on tax positions related to prior year\n1\n \n4\n \n—\n \nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n(\n5\n)\n—\n \n(\n27\n)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n89\n \n$\n93\n \n$\n89\n \nF-35\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Each quarter, the Company assesses the amounts provided for and, as a result, may increase or reduce the amount of interest and penalties. During each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded tax expense of $\n2\n million, $\n2\n million, and $\n1\n million, respectively, for interest and penalties. At December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company had an accrued liability for interest and penalties of $\n9\n million, $\n7\n million, and $\n5\n million, respectively.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company has an accrued liability of approximately $\n20\n million for all legal contingencies that are deemed to be probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. The Company’s estimates are based on information known about the matters and its experience in contesting, litigating, and settling similar matters. Although actual amounts could differ from management’s estimate, none of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity after consideration of recorded accruals. With respect to material matters for which the Company believes an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, the Company has disclosed the nature of the matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at this time. It is management’s opinion that the loss for any other litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nLouisiana Restoration\n  \nLouisiana surface owners often file lawsuits or assert claims against oil and gas companies, including the Company, claiming that operators and working interest owners in the chain of title are liable for environmental damages on the leased premises, including damages measured by the cost of restoration of the leased premises to its original condition, regardless of the value of the underlying property. From time to time, restoration lawsuits and claims are resolved by the Company for amounts that are not material to the Company, while new lawsuits and claims are asserted against the Company. With respect to each of the pending lawsuits and claims, the amount claimed is not currently determinable or is not material. Further, the overall exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable. While adverse judgments against the Company are possible, the Company intends to actively defend these lawsuits and claims.\nStarting in November of 2013 and continuing into 2023, several parishes in Louisiana have pending lawsuits against many oil and gas producers, including the Company. In these cases, the Parishes, as plaintiffs, allege that defendants’ oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation operations in specified fields were conducted in violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended, and applicable regulations, rules, orders, and ordinances promulgated or adopted thereunder by the Parish or the State of Louisiana. Plaintiffs allege that defendants caused substantial damage to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, unspecified damages for alleged violations of applicable law within the coastal zone, the payment of costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify, and otherwise restore the subject coastal zone as near as practicable to its original condition, and actual restoration of the coastal zone to its original condition. Without acknowledging or admitting any liability and solely to avoid the expense and uncertainty of future litigation, the Company agreed to settle with the State of Louisiana and Louisiana coastal Parishes to resolve any potential liability on the part of the Company for claims that were or could have been asserted by the coastal Parishes and/or the State of Louisiana in the pending litigation. The consideration paid by the Company in the settlement did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position. Following settlement of these various lawsuits, the Company will be a defendant in only one remaining coastal zone lawsuit, which was filed by the City of New Orleans against the Company and a number of oil and gas operators.\nF-36\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nApollo Exploration Lawsuit\nIn a case captioned \nApollo Exploration, LLC, Cogent Exploration, Ltd. Co. & SellmoCo, LLC v. Apache Corporation\n, Cause No. CV50538 in the 385\nth\n Judicial District Court, Midland County, Texas, plaintiffs alleged damages in excess of $\n200\n million (having previously claimed in excess of $\n1.1\n billion) relating to purchase and sale agreements, mineral leases, and area of mutual interest agreements concerning properties located in Hartley, Moore, Potter, and Oldham Counties, Texas. The trial court entered final judgment in favor of the Company, ruling that the plaintiffs take nothing by their claims and awarding the Company its attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in defending the lawsuit. The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court’s judgment thereby reinstating some of plaintiffs’ claims. The Texas Supreme Court granted the Company’s petition for review and heard oral argument in October 2022. On April 28, 2023, the Texas Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals’ decision and remanded the case back to the court of appeals for further proceedings. After plaintiffs’ request for rehearing, on July 21, 2023, the Texas Supreme Court reaffirmed its reversal of the court of appeals’ decision and remand of the case back to the court of appeals for further proceedings.\nAustralian Operations Divestiture Dispute\nPursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated April 9, 2015 (Quadrant SPA), the Company and its subsidiaries divested Australian operations to Quadrant Energy Pty Ltd (Quadrant). Closing occurred on June 5, 2015. In April 2017, the Company filed suit against Quadrant for breach of the Quadrant SPA. In its suit, the Company seeks approximately AUD $\n80\n million. In December 2017, Quadrant filed a defense of equitable set-off to the Company’s claim and a counterclaim seeking approximately AUD $\n200\n million in the aggregate. The Company will vigorously prosecute its claim while vigorously defending against Quadrant’s counter claims.\nDelaware Litigation\nOn September 10, 2020, the State of Delaware filed suit, individually and on behalf of the people of the State of Delaware, against over \n25\n oil and gas companies alleging damages as a result of global warming. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. The Company is vigorously defending the suit.\nKulp Minerals Lawsuit\nOn or about April 7, 2023, Apache was sued in a purported class action in New Mexico styled \nKulp Minerals LLC v. Apache Corporation\n, Case No. D-506-CV-2023-00352 in the Fifth Judicial District. The \nKulp Minerals\n case has not been certified and seeks to represent a group of owners allegedly owed statutory interest under New Mexico law as a result of purported late oil and gas payments. The amount of this claim is not yet reasonably determinable. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in this lawsuit.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had an undiscounted reserve for environmental remediation of approximately $\n2\n million. \nThe Company is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of December 31, 2024, that have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Company’s properties.\nPotential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties\nIn 2013, Apache sold its Gulf of America (GOA) Shelf operations and properties and its GOA operating subsidiary, GOM Shelf LLC (GOM Shelf) to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood). Fieldwood assumed the obligation to decommission the properties held by GOM Shelf and the properties acquired from Apache and its other subsidiaries (collectively, the Legacy GOA Assets). On February 14, 2018, Fieldwood filed for (and subsequently emerged from) Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On August 3, 2020, Fieldwood filed for (and subsequently emerged from) Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for a second time. Upon emergence from this second bankruptcy, \nthe Legacy GOA Assets were separated into a standalone company, which was subsequently merged into GOM Shelf. Under GOM Shelf’s limited liability company agreement, the proceeds of production of the Legacy GOA Assets are to be used to fund the operation of GOM Shelf and the decommissioning of Legacy GOA Assets.\n \nPursuant to the terms of the original transaction, as amended in the first bankruptcy, \nthe securing of the asset retirement obligations for the Legacy GOA Assets as and when Apache is required to perform or pay for any such decommissioning was \nF-37\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\naccomplished through the posting of letters of credit in favor of Apache (Letters of Credit), the provision of \ntwo\n bonds (Bonds) in favor of Apache, and the establishment of a trust account of which Apache was a beneficiary and which was funded by net profits interests (NPIs) depending on future oil prices. In addition, after such sources have been exhausted, Apache agreed upon resolution of GOM Shelf’s second bankruptcy to provide a standby loan to GOM Shelf of up to $\n400\n million to perform decommissioning, with such standby loan secured by a first and prior lien on the Legacy GOA Assets.\nBy letter dated April 5, 2022 (replacing \ntwo\n earlier letters) and by subsequent letter dated March 1, 2023, GOM Shelf notified the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) that it was unable to fund the decommissioning obligations that it was obligated to perform on certain of the Legacy GOA Assets. As a result, Apache and other current and former owners in these assets have received orders from BSEE and demands from third parties to decommission certain of the Legacy GOA Assets included in GOM Shelf’s notifications to BSEE. Apache expects to receive similar orders and demands on the other Legacy GOA Assets included in GOM Shelf’s notification letters. Apache has also received orders to decommission other Legacy GOA Assets that were not included in GOM Shelf’s notification letters. Further, Apache anticipates that GOM Shelf may send additional such notices to BSEE in the future and that it may receive additional orders from BSEE requiring it to decommission other Legacy GOA Assets.\nOn June 21, 2023, \ntwo\n sureties that issued Bonds directly to Apache and \ntwo\n sureties that issued bonds to the issuing bank on the Letters of Credit filed suit against Apache in a case styled \nZurich American Insurance Company, HCC International Insurance Company PLC, Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company and Everest Reinsurance Company (Insurers) v. Apache Corporation\n, Cause No. 2023-38238 in the 281\nst\n Judicial District Court, Harris County Texas. The sureties sought to prevent Apache from drawing on the $\n148\n million in Bonds and $\n350\n million in Letters of Credit and further alleged that they are discharged from their reimbursement obligations related to decommissioning costs and are entitled to other relief. On July 20, 2023, the 281\nst\n Judicial District Court denied the Insurers’ request for a temporary injunction. On July 26, 2023, Apache removed the suit to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division). Since the time the sureties filed their state court lawsuit, Apache has drawn down the entirety of the $\n350\n million in Letters of Credit. Apache has also sought to draw down on the Bonds; however, the sureties refused to honor such Bond draws. On September 12, 2024, the bankruptcy court issued its opinion (1) finding that sureties’ state court lawsuit against Apache was void; (2) holding that Apache’s claims against the sureties for unpaid amounts may proceed in bankruptcy court; and (3) holding the sureties in civil contempt and awarding attorneys’ fees to Apache as a sanction. The parties settled their dispute in the first quarter of 2025, which resulted in, among other things, mutual releases, the retention by Apache of all amounts drawn on the Letters of Credit, and payment to Apache of $\n140\n million under the Bonds.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded an asset of $\n178\n million representing the remaining amount the Company expects to be reimbursed from security related to these decommissioning costs. Of the total asset recorded as of December 31, 2024, $\n21\n million is reflected under the caption “Decommissioning security for sold Gulf of America properties,” and $\n157\n million is reflected under “Other current assets” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Apache estimates that its potential liability to fund the remaining decommissioning of Legacy GOA Assets and assets previously sold to other operators ranges from $\n1.0\n billion to $\n1.4\n billion on an undiscounted basis. Management does not believe any specific estimate within this range is a better estimate than any other. Accordingly, the Company recorded contingent liabilities in the amounts of $\n1.0\n billion and $\n824\n million as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the total liability recorded as of December 31, 2024, $\n929\n million is reflected under the caption “Decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of America properties” and $\n88\n million is reflected under “Other current liabilities” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Changes in significant assumptions impacting Apache’s estimated liability, including expected well decommissioning spread rates, derrick barge rates, and planned abandonment logistics, could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued.\nThe Company recognized $\n273\n million of “Losses on previously sold Gulf of America properties” during 2024 to reflect the net impact of an increase in estimated decommissioning costs of Legacy GOA Assets which BSSE may order the Company to decommission. The loss includes $\n67\n million related to properties previously sold to third parties other than Fieldwood for which the Company received BSSE orders to decommission during the year, as well as an increase to the estimated net liability the Company expects to incur for decommissioning Legacy GOA Assets. The Company also recognized losses on previously sold Gulf of America properties of $\n212\n million and $\n157\n million during 2023 and 2022, respectively, in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.\nF-38\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nLeases and Contractual Obligations\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is an operating or finance lease at the inception of each contract. If the contract is classified as an operating lease, the Company records an ROU asset and corresponding liability reflecting the total remaining present value of fixed lease payments over the expected term of the lease agreement. The expected term of the lease may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. If the Company’s lease does not provide an implicit rate in the contract, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate when calculating the present value. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various lease agreements for real estate, drilling rigs, vessels, aircrafts, and equipment related to its exploration and development activities, which are typically classified as operating leases under the provisions of the standard. ROU assets are reflected within “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and the associated operating lease liabilities are reflected within “Other current liabilities” and “Other” within “Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities,” as applicable.\nOperating lease expense associated with ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense is reflected on the statement of consolidated operations commensurate with the leased activities and nature of the services performed. Gross fixed operating lease expense, inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners, was $\n170\n million, $\n168\n million, and $\n145\n million for the years ended 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As allowed under the standard, the Company accounts for non-lease and lease components as a single lease component for all asset classes and has elected to exclude short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) from the balance sheet presentation. Costs incurred for short-term leases were $\n85\n million, $\n71\n million, and $\n62\n million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In 2024 these costs primarily related to short term drilling rigs in the U.S. and decommissioning work in the Gulf of America. In 2023 these costs primarily related to decommissioning work in the Gulf of America. In 2022, these costs were primarily related to drilling activities in Block 58 offshore Suriname. \nFinance lease assets are included in “Property and Equipment” on the consolidated balance sheet, and the associated finance lease liabilities are reflected within “\nCurrent debt\n” and “\nLong-term debt\n,” as applicable. Depreciation on the Company’s finance lease asset was $\n2\n million in each of the years 2024, 2023, and 2022. Interest on the Company’s finance lease liability was $\n1\n million, $\n1\n million, and $\n2\n million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table represents the Company’s weighted average lease term and discount rate as of December 31, 2024: \nOperating Leases\nFinance Lease\nWeighted average remaining lease term\n6.9\n years\n8.7\n years\nWeighted average discount rate\n5.8\n \n%\n4.4\n \n%\nF-39\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nAt December 31, 2024, contractual obligations for long-term operating leases, finance leases, and purchase obligations are as follows:\nNet Minimum Commitments\n(1)\nOperating Leases\n(2)\nFinance Lease\n(3)\nPurchase Obligations\n(4)(5)\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n122\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n244\n \n2026\n61\n \n4\n \n245\n \n2027\n48\n \n4\n \n173\n \n2028\n42\n \n4\n \n166\n \n2029\n35\n \n4\n \n148\n \nThereafter\n159\n \n18\n \n142\n \nTotal future minimum payments\n467\n \n37\n \n$\n1,118\n \nLess: imputed interest\n(\n94\n)\n(\n7\n)\nN/A\nTotal lease liabilities\n373\n \n30\n \nN/A\nCurrent portion\n118\n \n2\n \nN/A\nNon-current portion\n$\n255\n \n$\n28\n \nN/A\n(1)\nExcludes commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities for which the Company is not the operator.\n(2)\nAmounts represent future payments associated with oil and gas operations inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners.

These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable. Total costs incurred under take-or-pay and throughput obligations were $\n245\n million, $\n182\n million, and $\n183\n million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n(5)\nUnder terms agreed to in the Egypt merged concession agreement entered into in 2021, the Company committed to spend a minimum of $\n3.5\n billion on exploration, development, and operating activities by March 31, 2026. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has met and fully satisfied the obligation.\nThe lease liability reflected in the table above represents the Company’s fixed minimum payments that are settled in accordance with the lease terms. Actual lease payments during the period may also include variable lease components such as common area maintenance, usage-based sales taxes and rate differentials, or other similar costs that are not determinable at the inception of the lease. Gross variable lease payments, inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners were $\n48\n million, $\n74\n million, and $\n90\n million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nF-40\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n12.    \nRETIREMENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS\nThe Company provides retirement benefits to its U.S. employees through the use of multiple plans: a 401(k) savings plan, a money purchase retirement plan, a non-qualified retirement savings plan, and a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. The 401(k) savings plan provides participating employees the ability to elect to contribute up to \n50\n percent of eligible compensation to the plan with the Company making matching contributions up to a maximum of \n8\n percent of each employee’s annual eligible compensation. In addition, the Company contributes \n6\n percent of each participating employee’s annual eligible compensation to a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) savings plan and the money purchase retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions that limit the amount of employee and Company contributions. For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified retirement savings plan or a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. These plans allow the deferral of up to \n50\n percent of each employee’s base salary, up to \n75\n percent of each employee’s annual bonus (that accepts employee contributions) and the Company’s matching contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations imposed in the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement plan.\nVesting in the Company’s contributions in the 401(k) savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan, the non-qualified retirement savings plan and the non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan occurs at the rate of \n20\n percent for every completed year of employment. Upon a change in control of ownership of APA, immediate and full vesting occurs.\nThe aggregate annual cost to the Company of all U.S. and international\n \nsavings plans, the money purchase retirement plan, non-qualified retirement savings plan, and non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan was $\n46\n million, $\n44\n million, and $\n40\n million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees of the Company’s North Sea operations in the U.K. The plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of service and final salary. The plan applies only to employees who were part of BP North Sea’s pension plan as of April 2, 2003, prior to the acquisition of BP North Sea by the Company effective July 1, 2003.\nAdditionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible participants receive medical benefits up until the age of 65 or at the date they become eligible for Medicare, provided the participant remits the required portion of the cost of coverage. The plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement benefit plan does not cover benefit expenses once a covered participant becomes eligible for Medicare.\nF-41\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe following tables set forth the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets and funded status as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, and the underlying weighted average actuarial assumptions used for the U.K. Pension Plan and U.S. postretirement benefit plan.

As of December 31, 2024, \n7.9\n million shares were authorized and available for grant under the 2016 Plan. Previously approved plans remain in effect solely for the purpose of governing grants still outstanding that were issued prior to approval of the 2016 Plan. All new grants are issued from the 2016 Plan. In 2018, the Company began issuing cash-settled awards (phantom units) under the restricted stock and conditional restricted stock unit plans. The phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in the Company’s stock and, once vested, are settled in cash. \nF-45\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nCosts related to the plans are capitalized or expensed to “Lease operating expenses,” “Exploration,” or “General and administrative” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations based on the nature of each employee’s activities. \nThe following table summarizes the Company’s stock-settled and cash-settled compensation costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nStock-settled and cash-settled compensation expensed: \nLease operating expenses\n$\n16\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n82\n \nExploration\n4\n \n7\n \n29\n \nGeneral and administrative\n29\n \n50\n \n193\n \nTotal stock-settled and cash-settled compensation expensed\n49\n \n84\n \n304\n \nStock-settled and cash-settled compensation capitalized\n9\n \n13\n \n44\n \nTotal stock-settled and cash-settled compensation costs\n$\n58\n \n$\n97\n \n$\n348\n \nStock Options\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding options to purchase shares of its common stock under the 2016 Plan and the 2011 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2011 Plan and, with the 2016 Plan, the Omnibus Plans). The Omnibus Plans were submitted to and approved by the Company’s shareholders. New shares of common stock will be issued for employee stock option exercises.

Payout for the remaining portion of the shares is based on performance and financial objectives as defined in the plan. The overall results of the objectives are calculated at the end of the award’s stated performance period and, if a payout is warranted, applied to the target number of restricted stock units awarded. The performance shares will immediately vest \n50\n percent at the end of the \nthree-year\n performance period, with the remaining \n50\n percent vesting at the end of the following year.

The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. During 2024, sales to EGPC accounted for approximately \n17\n percent of the Company’s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues. During each of 2023 and 2022, sales to EGPC accounted for approximately \n15\n percent of the Company’s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues.\nManagement does not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations.\nF-49\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n16.    \nBUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries are engaged in exploration, development and/or production activities across \nfour\n operating segments: Egypt, North Sea, Suriname, and the U.S. The Company’s business explores for, develops, and produces crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. The Company also has exploration interests in Uruguay, Alaska, and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. Prior to the deconsolidation of Altus on February 22, 2022, the Company’s Midstream business was operated by ALTM, which owned, developed, and operating a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas.\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is a function (not necessarily an individual) that allocates the resources of the reporting entity and assesses the performance of its segments. Decisions to assess performance and allocate resources are made by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr. John J. Christmann, IV. Therefore, management has concluded that the CEO of the Company is the CODM. The information regularly reviewed by the CODM to assess performance and allocate resources is primarily associated with operating income from each segment and the resulting free cash flow, amongst other metrics. The Company concluded that the most comparable measure under U.S. GAAP is operating income.\nFinancial information for each segment is presented below:\nU.S.\nEgypt\n(1)\nNorth Sea\nIntersegment

Information\nProved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.\nEstimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, the Company uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy with similar properties. The Company will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the Company’s reserve estimates.\nF-55\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures.

The Company had combined upward revisions of previously estimated reserves of \n75\n MMboe. Upward revisions related to miscellaneous changes accounted for \n5\n MMboe. Engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for \n70\n MMboe, with Egypt accounting for an increase of \n43\n MMboe, primarily the result of PSC modernization in Egypt. The North Sea contributed \n9\n MMboe of upward revisions from well performance and reactivations in both the Beryl and Forties programs. In the United States, the Company experienced positive revisions of \n18\n MMboe. The Company acquired \n39\n MMboe of proved reserves during 2022, primarily in the Delaware Basin. The Company also sold \n26\n MMboe of proved reserves associated with U.S. divestitures, primarily related to Permian Basin assets.\nApproximately \n11\n percent of the Company’s year-end 2024 estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing because of mechanical reasons. These reserves are considered to be a lower tier of reserves than producing reserves because they are frequently based on volumetric calculations rather than performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe reserves is scheduled to follow depletion of the currently producing zones in the same wellbores. Additional capital may have to be spent to access these reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing are reflected in this Note 17, under “Future Net Cash Flows.”\nFuture Net Cash Flows\nFuture cash inflows as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil and gas prices in effect on the first day of each month in the respective year, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Future development costs include abandonment and dismantlement costs.\nF-60\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe following table sets forth unaudited information concerning future net cash flows for proved oil and gas reserves, net of income tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available, under laws in effect as of December 31, 2024, and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. This information does not purport to present the fair market value of the Company’s oil and gas assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning possible future net cash flows that would result under the assumptions used.\nUnited\nStates\nEgypt\n(1)\nNorth\nSea\nSuriname\nTotal\n(1)\n \n(In millions)\n2024\nCash inflows\n$\n27,534\n \n$\n9,342\n \n$\n2,828\n \n$\n5,881\n \n$\n45,585\n \nProduction costs\n(\n9,665\n)\n(\n1,716\n)\n(\n1,399\n)\n(\n1,436\n)\n(\n14,216\n)\nDevelopment costs\n(\n4,124\n)\n(\n1,517\n)\n(\n2,538\n)\n(\n1,096\n)\n(\n9,275\n)\nIncome tax expense\n(\n921\n)\n(\n1,923\n)\n85\n \n(\n822\n)\n(\n3,581\n)\nNet cash flows\n12,824\n \n4,186\n \n(\n1,024\n)\n2,527\n \n18,513\n \n10 percent discount rate\n(\n4,317\n)\n(\n872\n)\n535\n \n(\n2,280\n)\n(\n6,934\n)\nDiscounted future net cash flows\n(2)\n$\n8,507\n \n$\n3,314\n \n$\n(\n489\n)\n$\n247\n \n$\n11,579\n \n2023\nCash inflows\n$\n21,417\n \n$\n9,921\n \n$\n5,761\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n37,099\n \nProduction costs\n(\n8,328\n)\n(\n1,690\n)\n(\n2,773\n)\n—\n \n(\n12,791\n)\nDevelopment costs\n(\n2,238\n)\n(\n1,235\n)\n(\n2,461\n)\n—\n \n(\n5,934\n)\nIncome tax expense\n(\n949\n)\n(\n2,222\n)\n(\n946\n)\n—\n \n(\n4,117\n)\nNet cash flows\n9,902\n \n4,774\n \n(\n419\n)\n—\n \n14,257\n \n10 percent discount rate\n(\n3,749\n)\n(\n943\n)\n476\n \n—\n \n(\n4,216\n)\nDiscounted future net cash flows\n(2)\n$\n6,153\n \n$\n3,831\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n10,041\n \n2022\nCash inflows\n$\n31,577\n \n$\n12,819\n \n$\n10,147\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n54,543\n \nProduction costs\n(\n10,763\n)\n(\n2,086\n)\n(\n3,241\n)\n—\n \n(\n16,090\n)\nDevelopment costs\n(\n1,733\n)\n(\n1,471\n)\n(\n2,297\n)\n—\n \n(\n5,501\n)\nIncome tax expense\n(\n1,575\n)\n(\n2,729\n)\n(\n2,631\n)\n—\n \n(\n6,935\n)\nNet cash flows\n17,506\n \n6,533\n \n1,978\n \n—\n \n26,017\n \n10 percent discount rate\n(\n6,811\n)\n(\n1,400\n)\n(\n204\n)\n—\n \n(\n8,415\n)\nDiscounted future net cash flows\n(2)\n$\n10,695\n \n$\n5,133\n \n$\n1,774\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n17,602\n \n(1)\nIncludes discounted future net cash flows of approximately $\n1.1\n billion\n, \n$\n1.3\n billion, and $\n1.7\n billion as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt.\n(2)\nEstimated future net cash flows before income tax expense, discounted at \n10\n percent per annum, totaled approximately $\n14.4\n billion\n, \n$\n13.6\n billion, and $\n22.6\n billion as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nF-61\nAPA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe following table sets forth the principal sources of change in the discounted future net cash flows:\n \nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nSales, net of production costs\n$\n(\n5,806\n)\n$\n(\n5,408\n)\n$\n(\n7,131\n)\nNet change in prices and production costs\n269\n \n(\n7,089\n)\n8,690\n \nDiscoveries and improved recovery, net of related costs\n3,557\n \n1,869\n \n1,142\n \nChange in future development costs\n(\n695\n)\n(\n413\n)\n(\n343\n)\nPreviously estimated development costs incurred during the period\n793\n \n825\n \n669\n \nRevision of quantities\n(\n428\n)\n(\n262\n)\n2,646\n \nPurchases of minerals in-place\n4,166\n \n1\n \n911\n \nAccretion of discount\n1,357\n \n2,260\n \n1,489\n \nChange in income taxes\n737\n \n1,467\n \n(\n2,467\n)\nSales of minerals in-place\n(\n1,865\n)\n(\n18\n)\n(\n363\n)\nChange in production rates and other\n(\n547\n)\n(\n793\n)\n(\n1\n)\n$\n1,538\n \n$\n(\n7,561\n)\n$\n5,242\n \nF-62"
