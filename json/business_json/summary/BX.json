  "item1_summary": " Difficult market, economic and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow . Failure to manage or reduce our costs and other expenses within a time frame sufficient to match any decrease in profitability would adversely affect the company's operating performance . Turmoil in the global financial markets can provoke significant volatility of equity and debt securities prices .\n As public traded equity securities have in recent years represented a meaningful proportion of the assets of many of our funds, stock market volatility, including a sharp decline in the stock market, may adversely affect our results, including our revenues and net income . Our public equity holdings have at times been concentrated in a few large positions, thereby making our unrealized unrealized valuations particularly sensitive to sharp changes in the price of these positions .\n Interest rates would continue to present a challenge to real estate valuations . Geopolitical concerns and other global events outside of our control have also contributed and may continue to contribute to volatile global equity and debt markets . These concerns and events include, without limitation, trade conflict, civil unrest, threats to national security, national and international security events .\n In addition to the factors described above, other market, economic and geopolitical factors described herein that may adversely affect our business include, without limitation, higher prices for commodities or other goods, higher interest rates and/or a lack of availability of credit in the U.S. and internationally . A period of economic slowdown, which may occur across one or more industries, sectors or geographies, creates operating performance challenges .\n A sustained high interest rate environment could increase the likelihood of an economic slowdown . Slowing growth in certain markets and real estate sectors with excess supply, such as life sciences office and U.S. multifamily, has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the valuations of assets in such sectors in the near-term .\n High interest rates and challenging debt market conditions have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the values of certain assets or investments . Elevated interest rates create downward pressure on the value of some assets owned by our fu. unds . Negative market conditions would also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by our funds that have significant debt investments, such as our credit-focused funds .\n A significant contraction or weakening in the market for debt financing or other adverse change relating to the terms of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our business . An increase in interest rates could also contribute to a period of economic slowdown, which would create operating performance challenges for certain of our funds’ investments .\n Changes in U.S. and foreign taxation of businesses could adversely affect us, including by adversely impacting our effective tax rate and tax liability . High interest rates, coupled with periods of significant equity and credit market volatility, may potentially make it more difficult for us to find attractive opportunities for our funds to exit and realize value from their existing investments .\n A decline in the pace or size of investments made by our funds may adversely affect our revenues . The revenues that we earn are driven in part by the pace at which our funds make investments and the size of those investments . The fees we earn from our perpetual capital vehicles represent a significant and growing portion of our overall revenues .\n A number of our funds have invested and intend to continue to invest in large transactions or transactions that otherwise have substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity and may be more difficult to execute successfully than smaller or less complex investments . The process of obtaining pre-approval for certain transactions undertaken by our investment funds is expected to become more administratively burdensome and time consuming .\n Our revenue, earnings, net income and cash flow can all vary materially due to our reliance on Performance Revenues, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of our common stock to decline . The ability to deploy capital in China has been adversely impacted by policies and regulations in the U.S.\n The lack of guidance may affect the expectations of public market analysts and could cause increased volatility in our common stock price . We earn incentive income only if net asset value of a vehicle has increased or, in the case of certain vehicles, increased beyond a particular return threshold, or if the vehicle has earned a net profit .\n It may be a number of years before any profits can be realized, particularly if market conditions are unaccommodating . We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur . Valuations of, and realization opportunities for, investments made by, our funds, could also be subject to high volatility .\n The timing and receipt of Performance Allocations also varies with the life cycle of our carry funds . During periods in which a relatively large portion of our assets under management is attributable to carry funds and investments in their “harvesting” period, our carry funds would make larger distributions than in the fundraising or investment periods that precede harvesting .\n If growth of the global economy decelerates, conditions in the financing markets were challenged, the investment performance of our funds could suffer, resulting in, for example, the payment of decreased or no Performance Allocations to us . As of December 31, 2024, we had $2.0 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents, $1.1 billion invested in Corporate Treasury Investments and $5.8 billion in Other Investments .\n Our business depends in large part on our ability to raise capital from third-party investors . We expect to continue to make significant principal investments in our current and future investment funds . Contributing capital to these investment funds is risky, and we may lose some or the entire principal amount of our investments, including, without limitation, as a result of poor investment performance .\n In addition, volatility in the valuations of investments, has in the past and may in the future affect our ability to raise capital from  third-party investors . Other states could potentially take similar actions, which may further impair our access to capital from an investor base that has historically represented a significant portion of our fundraising .\n An investment in a limited partner interest in an alternative investment fund is generally more illiquid and the returns on such investment may be more volatile than an investment in securities for which there is a more active and transparent market . Alternative investments could also fall into disfavor as a result of concerns about liquidity and short-term performance .\n As some existing investors cease or significantly curtail making commitments to alternative investment funds, we may need to identify and attract new investors in order to maintain or increase the size of our investment funds . A failure to successfully raise capital could materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition . We negotiate terms for such funds and investments with existing and potential investors .\n There can be no assurance that such alternatives will be as profitable for us as the traditional investment fund structure, or as to the impact such a trend could have on the cost of our operations or profitability . The asset management business is intensely competitive. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the quality of client service, client service and investor availability of capital and willingness to invest .\n Some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors’ funds or other available investment products . A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:  certain traditional asset managers have developed their own private equity and private wealth platforms . Many of our competitors have significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours .\n Some of our competitors may be willing to pay higher placement, servicing or other forms of distributor fees, which may adversely impact the amount of capital we are able to raise in the private wealth channel . There are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new alternative asset managers, and the successful efforts of new entrants, including former “star” portfolio managers at large diversified financial institutions, is expected to continue to result in increased competition .\n Some of our competitors may be more successful than we are in the development and implementation of new technologies, including services and platforms based on artificial intelligence, to address investor demand or improve operations . Technology innovation has the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way financial institutions, including asset managers, do business . Other industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us .\n Costs associated with the distribution of certain of our private wealth perpetual products have increased . There may be further increases in distribution costs for these and future products . The attractiveness of our investment funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease depending on economic conditions . Any new or incremental regulatory measures for the U.S. financial services industry may increase costs and create regulatory uncertainty .\n We have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we offer to individual investors . Accessing individual investors exposes us to greater levels of risk, including heightened litigation and regulatory enforcement, an increased compliance burden, and more complex administration and accounting operations . We may be subject to claims related to matters such as the adequacy of disclosures, appropriate fees, suitability and board of directors’ oversight .\n To the extent distribution of such products is through new channels and markets, including through an increasing number of distributors with whom we engage, we may not be able to effectively monitor or control the manner of their distribution . This could result in litigation or regulatory action against us, including with respect to claims that products distributed through such channels are distributed to investors for whom they are unsuitable .\n As we expand the distribution of products to individual investors outside of the United States, we are increasingly exposed to risks in non-U.S. jurisdictions . Securities laws and other applicable regulatory regimes can be extensive, complex and vary by jurisdiction . There is a risk that Blackstone employees involved in the direct distribution of our products, or employees who engage with independent advisors, brokerage firms and other third parties .\n We depend on the efforts, skill, reputations and business contacts of Stephen A. Schwarzman, our President, Jonathan D. Gray, and other key senior managing directors and personnel . We cannot predict the impact that the departure of any key personnel will have on our ability to achieve our investment objectives . For e.C.J. Blackstone: Loss of services would have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition .\n The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on revenues, net income and cash flows . Blackstone has historically relied in part on the interests of these professionals in the investment funds’ carried interest and incentive fees to discourage them from leaving the firm . For example, U.S. federal income tax law currently imposes a three-year holding period requirement for carried interest to be treated as capital gains .\n The current U.S. Presidential administration’s stated tax priorities include changes to the tax treatment of carried interest that, if implemented, would materially increase the amount of taxes many of our key personnel would be required to pay . The levying of additional taxes on carried interest, or possible increase in state law tax rates, along with changing opinions regarding living in some geographies where we have offices, may adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our current and future professionals .\n Legislation that would prohibit  post-employment agreements except in limited circumstances has been introduced in New York . Changes in U.S. and foreign taxation of businesses and other tax laws, regulations or treaties could adversely affect us, including by adversely impacting our effective tax rate and tax liability . Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities .\n Past and future changes to tax laws and regulations may have an adverse impact on us . Changes could materially change the amount and/or timing of tax we and our portfolio companies may be required to pay . Tax authorities have challenged and could challenge our interpretation of such laws, regulations and treaties . The timing and details of any such tax reform is uncertain .\n The BEPS project is focused on the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions . The OECD is also working on a two-pillar initiative aimed at shifting taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer . The United States is not expected to adopt Pillar Two, creating additional uncertainty as to the application of these rules to multinational enterprises with a U.S. parent .\n Cybersecurity and data protection risks could result in the loss of data, interruptions in our business, and damage to our reputation . The timing, scope and impact of any relevant domestic legislation or multilateral conventions remain uncertain . Cyberattacks and other data security threats could originate from a wide variety of external sources, including cyber criminals, nation state hackers, hacktivists and other outside parties .\n There has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of the cyber and data security threats we face, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally to those that are more advanced and persistent . As an alternative asset management firm, we hold a significant amount of confidential and sensitive information about our investors, our funds’ portfolio companies and potential investments .\n Blackstone: Cybersecurity, privacy and data protection have become top priorities for regulators around the world . Cybersecurity threats and compromises could occur as a result of threat actors impersonating Blackstone or its employees, including through the use of artificial intelligence technologies . Some jurisdictions have also enacted or proposed laws requiring companies to notify individuals and government agencies of data security breaches .\n In light of the focus of federal regulators on cybersecurity, SEC enforcement activity, including by the SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations in its examination programs, has increased in recent years . It is possible that current and future cyber enforcement activity will target practices that we believe are compliant, but the SEC deems otherwise .\n Our funds’ portfolio companies rely on data processing systems and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information, including payment and health information, which in some instances are provided by third parties . A disruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on the value of these businesses . Technology platforms, data and intellectual property are also subject to a heightened risk of theft or compromise .\n Global data security and privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcement risks and reputational damage . We and our funds’ portfolio companies are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, storage, transmission and other processing of personal data . Any inability, or perceived inability, by us to adequately address privacy concerns, or comply with applicable privacy laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, or related contractual obligations, even if unfounded .\n Global laws in this area are rapidly increasing in the scale and depth of their requirements . Compliance obligations also include those relating to foreign data collection and privacy laws, including, for example, the GDPR and U.K. Data Protection Act, as well as laws in many other jurisdictions globally . Many regulators have indicated an intention to take more aggressive enforcement actions regarding data privacy matters .\n SEC's stated examination priorities include an intended focus on adviser’s policies and procedures, internal controls, oversight of  third-party vendors and governance practices as it pertains to the safeguarding of customer records . As new data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us and our funds’ portfolio companies to comply with such laws . The full extent of current or future risks related thereto is not possible to predict .\n We avail ourselves of the potential benefits, insights and efficiencies resulting from these technologies . But these technologies present a number of potential risks that cannot be fully mitigated . Data in models that AI Technologies utilize are likely to contain a degree of inaccuracy and error, which could result in flawed algorithms . The volume and reliance on data and algorithms also make AI Technologies more susceptible to cybersecurity threats, including the compromise of underlying models .\n There is also a risk that AI Technologies may be misused or misappropriated by our employees and/or third parties engaged by us . We may not be able to control how AI Technologies that we choose to use are developed or maintained, or how data we input is used or disclosed, even where we have sought contractual protections with respect to these matters .\n In October 2023, an executive order established new standards for AI safety and security . In 2024, the EU adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act in 2024, which applies to certain AI Technologies and the data used to train, test and deploy them . The possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens on our business .\n The financial services industry in recent years has been the subject of heightened scrutiny, and the SEC has specifically focused on private equity and the private funds industry . The SEC has proposed, and in some instances, adopted, rules related to private funds and private fund advisors that impact our business and operations . Such increased obligations may increase our costs, including if we are required to spend more time, hire additional personnel, or buy new technology to comply effectively .\n In February 2023, the SEC proposed extensive amendments to the custody rule for SEC-registered investment advisers . If adopted, these new rules could significantly increase compliance burdens and associated regulatory costs and complexity for Blackstone . Blackstone says the full extent of their impact would be unclear whether such proposed rules will ultimately be adopted .\n We are subject to requests for information, inquiries and informal or formal investigations by the SEC and other regulatory authorities . SEC actions and initiatives can have an adverse effect on our financial results, including as a result of the imposition of a sanction, a limitation on our or our personnel’s activities, or changing our historic practices .\n Alternative asset managers have become subject to competing demands from different investors and other stakeholder groups with divergent views on sustainability matters . Certain investors, including public pension funds, have placed increasing importance on the impacts of investments made by the private funds to which they commit capital, including with respect to climate change, among other aspects of sustainability .\n Regulatory initiatives to require investors to make disclosures to their stakeholders regarding sustainability matters have become increasingly common in certain jurisdictions . Failure to successfully manage  sustainability-related expectations across the varied interests of our stakeholders, including existing or potential investors, may adversely impact our ability to access and deploy capital . Government authorities of certain U.S. states have requested information from and scrutinized certain asset managers with respect to whether such managers have adopted sustainability policies .\n The SEC has commenced enforcement actions against several investment advisers relating to sustainability disclosures and policies and procedures failures . European regulatory environment for alternative investment fund managers and financial services firms continues to evolve and increase in complexity, making compliance more costly and time-consuming . Any perception or accusation that we are overstating, or, conversely, understating our engagement in sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business and the operations of our funds’ portfolio companies .\n These initiatives could be difficult and expensive to implement, the personnel, processes and technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace . We could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure related to our or our funds’  sustainability-related policies, practices and initiatives .\n We, our funds and our funds’ portfolio companies face risks associated with climate change . EU has adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”), the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (‘SFDR’) Several U.S. states are also at various stages seeking to regulate climate-related disclosures .\n The current U.S. Presidential administration may seek to modify policies or regulations of the prior administration, including limitations on coal and gas electric generation, mining and/or exploration . For certain of our funds’ portfolio companies, business trends related to climate change may require capital expenditures, product or service redesigns and changes to operations and supply chains .\n Climate change can have an adverse impact on certain of our funds’ portfolio companies and investments, especially our real asset investments and portfolio companies that rely on physical factories, plants, stores or other assets located in the affected areas . As the effects of climate change increase, we expect the frequency and impact of  weather-related events and conditions to increase .\n Financial regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business . The financial services industry continues to be the subject of heightened regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. There has been active debate over the appropriate extent of regulation and oversight of private investment funds and their managers . New regulations or interpretations of existing laws may result in enhanced disclosure obligations .\n If we were to be designated as such by the FSOC, we could be subject to a materially greater regulatory burden . This could adversely impact our compliance and other costs, the implementation of certain of our investment strategies and our profitability . Whistleblower claims have increased significantly since the enactment of these provisions and in the 2023 fiscal year the SEC awarded approximately $600 million to 68 individuals .\n The potential for governmental policy and/or legislative changes and regulatory reform may create regulatory uncertainty for our investment strategies . Failure on our part to comply with such rules could result in enforcement action, expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage . The continued regulatory focus on Regulation Best Interest may negatively impact whether certain broker-dealers are willing to recommend investment products to retail customers .\n The failure to accurately anticipate the possible outcome of such changes and/or reforms could have a material adverse effect on the returns generated from our funds’ investments and our revenues . Anticipating policy changes and reforms may be particularly difficult during periods of heightened partisanship at the federal, state and local levels, including due to the divisiveness surrounding populist movements .\n \"Shadow banking\" is a term generally taken to refer to financial intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regulated banking system . Federal regulatory bodies, such as the FSOC, and international organizations, regularly assess financial stability-related risks associated with, among other things, nonbank lending and certain types of  open-end-end funds .\n The elimination of an “activities-based” approach over designation of an individual firm as a nonbank SIFI may increase the likelihood of FSOC designating one or more firms as SIFIs . Requirements such as these were designed to regulate banking institutions would likely need to be modified to be applicable to an asset manager .\n The U.S. government has indicated its intent to alter its approach to international trade policy . Tariffs on goods imported from China, Canada and Mexico could further increase costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of products and services offered by current and future portfolio companies . This could materially adversely affect the revenues and profits of our portfolio companies, we say .\n The U.S. has implemented a number of economic sanctions programs and export controls that specifically target Chinese entities and nationals on national security grounds . Further escalation of the “trade war” between the U.K. and China, the countries’ inability to reach further trade agreements, or the continued use of reciprocal sanctions by each country, may negatively impact opportunities for investment as well as the rate of global growth .\n BXCI’s insurance platform currently manages assets for a number of insurance companies and certain of their respective affiliates pursuant to several investment management agreements . The continued success of our insurance platform will depend in large part on further developing investment partnerships with insurance company clients and maintaining existing asset management arrangements, including those described above .\n The insurance industries are subject to significant regulatory oversight . Regulators and other authorities generally have the power to bring administrative or judicial proceedings against insurance companies . We may be the target or subject of, or may have indemnification obligations related to, litigation (including class action litigation by policyholders), enforcement investigations or regulatory scrutiny . Failure may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition .\n Insurance regulatory authorities and regulatory support organizations have increased scrutiny of private equity’s involvement in the insurance industry . This has included focus on whether such agreements are at arms’ length, establish a control relationship with the insurance company, grant the asset manager excessive authority or oversight over the investment strategy . Regulators have also increasingly focused on the risk profile of certain investments held by insurance companies .\n Some of the arrangements we have or will develop with insurance companies involve complex U.S. tax structures for which no clear precedent or authority may be available . Insurance companies are subject to certain minimum capital and surplus requirements that vary by the jurisdiction where the insurance company is domiciled . Insurance company investment portfolios often subject to internal and regulatory requirements governing the categories and ratings of investment products and assets they may acquire and hold .\n In the United States, our insurance company clients are subject to  risk-based capital (“RBC”) standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed by state laws . The NAIC increased the applicable capital charge of residual tranches or equity securities of asset-based securitizations from 30% to 45% in 2024 . This increase in the applicable RBC charge of such assets could potentially make such assets less attractive to insurers .\n We regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the Exchange Act, the 1940 Act and the Commodity Exchange Act . These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control . If for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us, we could become subject to regulatory action or  third-party claims .\n In Europe, the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) establishes a regulatory regime for alternative investment fund managers (“AIFMs”), including our AIFMs in Luxembourg and Ireland . Changes to AIFMD, most of which will come into effect in 2026, have been adopted in the EU . These changes increase the compliance burdens on certain of our funds .\n Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2014 (2014/65/EU) (“MiFID II”) requires us to comply with disclosure, transparency, reporting and record keeping obligations and enhanced obligations in relation to receipt of investment research, best execution, product governance and marketing communications . Each of the aforementioned regulations is likely to increase the operational burden and costs associated with certain of our and our funds' operations .\n Global data security and privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcement risks and reputational damage . European regulators are increasing their attention on greenwashing and rapidly developing and implementing regimes focused on sustainability within the financial services sector . A number of jurisdictions, including the U.S., have restrictions on foreign direct investment .\n State and/or regulatory bodies have the authority to block or impose conditions with respect to certain transactions, such as investments, acquisitions and divestitures, if such transaction threatens to impair national security . Many jurisdictions restrict foreign investment in assets important to national security by placing limitations on foreign equity investment, implementing investment screening or approval mechanisms, and restricting the employment of foreigners as key personnel .\n In August 2023, an executive order established an outbound investment screening regime (the “Outbound Order”), which was intended to regulate or prohibit certain investments by U.S. persons in advanced technology sectors in jurisdictions that may be designated as a “country of concern . China, along with the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Hong Kong, may be a country of concern. These actions could negatively impact our ability to raise capital .\n Heightened scrutiny of foreign direct investment worldwide may also make it more difficult for us to identify suitable buyers for investments upon exit and may constrain the universe of exit opportunities for an investment in a portfolio company . Failure by us or our funds’ portfolio companies to comply with laws could expose us to significant penalties, sanctions, loss of future investment opportunities, additional regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm .\n In recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against the financial services industry in general have been increasing . Investors may have remedies against us, our investment funds, our senior managing directors or our affiliates under the federal securities law and/or state law . Such actions could result in significant reputational harm, which could seriously harm our business .\n The activities of our capital markets services business may also subject us to the risk of liabilities to clients and third parties . Allegations by private actors, regulators, or employees of improper conduct by us, even if unfounded, may harm our reputation . The pervasiveness of social media and public focus on externalities of business activities could lead to wider dissemination of adverse or inaccurate information about us .\n Our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business . We are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, EU and U.K. anti-bribery laws . Detecting or deterring employee misconduct is not always possible, and the extensive precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases .\n U.S. stration has signed an executive order to pause, subject to certain exceptions, the initiation of new investigations and enforcement actions under the FCPA . The EU and the U.K. are similarly revising their respective anti-money laundering regimes . The application of these rules would impose significant compliance costs on us .\n Poor performance of our investment funds would cause a decline in our revenue, income and cash flow, may obligate us to repay Performance Allocations previously paid to us, and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future investment funds . We may also be adversely affected if there is misconduct by personnel of our funds’ portfolio companies or by such companies’ service providers .\n Any of our investment funds were to perform poorly, our revenue, income and cash flow would decline . Poor performance of our investments could make it more difficult for us to raise new capital . Investors in funds might decline to invest in future investment funds we raise and investors in hedge funds or other investment funds might withdraw their investments .\n Our ability to raise capital for existing and future investment funds and avoid excessive redemption levels will depend on our investment funds’ continued satisfactory performance . Poor fund performance may deter future investment in our funds and thereby decrease the capital invested in such funds and ultimately, our management fee revenue . In addition to the risk of poor performance, such activity may subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk .\n In the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made, holders of securities ranking senior to our fund’s investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made . Debt investments made by our funds in our portfolio companies may be equitably subordinated to those made by third parties . The historical returns attributable to our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds .\n Investment funds that we manage are not directly linked to returns on our common stock . We may create new funds in the future that reflect a different asset mix and different investment strategies . The rates of returns of our carry funds reflect unrealized gains that may never be realized, which may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from those funds’ investments .\n Newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period in which they initially deploy their capital . Future returns will be affected by the applicable risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular fund invests . Certain policies and procedures implemented to mitigate potential conflicts of interest may reduce the synergies across our various businesses .\n As we have expanded, and continue to expand, the number and scope of our businesses, we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our funds’ investment activities . Because of our size and the variety of businesses and investment strategies that we pursue, we may face a higher degree of scrutiny compared with investment managers that are smaller or focus on fewer asset classes . Certain of our funds may have overlapping investment objectives .\n The risk that fund investors or regulators could challenge allocation decisions as inconsistent with our obligations under applicable law, governing fund agreements or our own policies cannot be eliminated . The perception of  non-compliance with such requirements or policies could harm our reputation with fund investors . The challenge of allocating investment opportunities to certain funds may be exacerbated as we expand our business .\n Conflicts of interest may exist in the valuation of our funds’ investments, as well as the personal trading of employees and the allocation of fees and expenses among us, our funds and their portfolio companies, and our affiliates . A failure to appropriately deal with these, among other, conflicts, could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds .\n The investment advisers of our funds may have an incentive to provide potential co-investment-related opportunities to certain investors in lieu of others . At the same time, we may have a incentive to offer . transactions that may otherwise be attractive to the fund and its investors, which may adversely impact fund performance . There can be no assurance that . opportunities of any particular type or amount will become available .\n There may be conflicts of interest regarding allocation of costs and expenses between investors and funds . Valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can be subject to a significant degree of subjectivity and judgment . There is a risk that regulators and/or investors could challenge our allocations of investment opportunities or fees and expenses .\n The fair value of such investments and financial instruments is generally determined using a primary methodology and corroborated by a secondary methodology . Methodologies are used on a consistent basis and described in Blackstone’s and the investment funds’ valuation policies and governing agreements . The determination of fair value using these methodologies takes into consideration a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired .\n The SEC continues to focus on issues related to valuation of private funds, including consistent application of the methodology, disclosure, and conflicts of interest, in its enforcement, examination, and rulemaking activities . Valuations of publicly traded companies are based on the observable price in the reference market which are generally subject to a higher degree of market volatility .\n Changes in values of investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in our investment funds’ net asset value . We use borrowings to finance our business operations as a public company . As borrowings under the credit facility and our outstanding notes mature, we will be required to refinance or repay such borrowings . We may also issue equity, which would dilute existing stockholders .\n There is no guarantee that such financial institutions will continue to extend credit to us or that we will be able to access the capital markets . The use of leverage to finance our business exposes us to the types of risk described in “— Dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments .\n Many of our funds’ investments rely heavily on the use of leverage . The absence of available sources of sufficient senior debt financing for extended periods of time could materially and adversely affect our private equity and real estate businesses . An increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those busines .\n Investments in highly leveraged entities are inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates . The incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things, limit the entity’s ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors .\n The risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less debt . A fund may borrow money from time to time to purchase or carry securities . The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by appreciation in the securities purchased or carried and will be lost .\n Gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund’s net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings . If investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. ccelerated or exacerbated in the event of a decline in the market value of such securities.\n The materiality of various risks and impact of such risks depend on many factors, including the relevant industry, geography and asset class . Outside consultants, legal advisers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due  diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment . Some matters covered by our diligence, such as sustainability, are continuously evolving and we may not accurately or fully anticipate such evolution .\n We may not be able to consummate or successfully integrate development opportunities, acquisitions or joint ventures that we pursue . We may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs associated with integrating and overseeing the operations of the new businesses . We and our affiliates from time to time are required to report specified dealings or transactions involving Iran or other sanctioned individuals or entities .\n ITRA requires companies to disclose transactions even if they were permissible under U.S. law . Failure to disclose any such activities as required could additionally result in fines or penalties . Disclosure of such activity, even if such activity is not subject to sanctions under applicable law, could harm our reputation and have a negative impact on our business .\n The ability of many of our investment funds, particularly our private equity funds, to dispose of investments is heavily dependent on the public equity markets . The ability to realize any value from an investment may depend upon the ability to complete an initial public offering of the portfolio company in which such investment is held . We make investments in companies that are based outside of the United States, which may expose us to additional risks .\n Investments in non-U.S. securities involve certain factors not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the United States . International investments have increased and we expect will continue to increase as a proportion of certain of our funds’ portfolios in the future . Risk factors include currency exchange rates, less developed or efficient financial markets, less government supervision and regulation .\n Investments in companies based outside of the United States may be negatively impacted by restrictions on international trade or the imposition of tariffs, which have been an area of focus for the current U.S. administration . Trade negotiations and related government actions may create regulatory uncertainty for our funds’ portfolio companies and our investment strategies .\n The general partner receives in excess of the relevant Performance Allocations applicable to the fund . This includes situations in which the fund has not achieved investment returns that exceed the preferred return threshold . This obligation is known as a “clawback” obligation . The clawback obligation operates with respect to a given carry fund’s own net investment performance .\n Investors in our hedge funds may generally redeem their investments on a periodic basis following, in certain cases,  the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be withdrawn, subject to certain redemption provisions . Investors in certain vehicles that permit investors in such vehicles to withdraw their investments and/or terminate our management of such capital, as applicable .\n In a declining market, our liquid or semi-liquid vehicles have and may continue to experience declines in value, which may be provoked and/or exacerbated by margin calls and forced selling of assets . Investors may also seek to redeem their interests due to changes in interest rates that make other investments more attractive, rebalancing of their asset allocations, changes in investor perception of us and our reputation .\n In addition, we currently manage a significant portion of investor assets through separately managed accounts . The boards of directors of the investment management companies we manage could terminate our advisory engagement of those companies, on as little as 30 days’ prior written notice . In the case of any such terminations, the management and incentive fees we earn in connection with managing such account or company would immediately cease, which could result in a significant adverse impact on our revenues .\n In the event certain “key persons” in our investment funds do not meet specified time commitments with regard to managing the fund, then investors in certain funds have the right to vote to terminate the investment period by a specified percentage (including, in certain cases, a simple majority) vote of investors is required to restart it . In addition to having a significant negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow, the occurrence of such an event would likely result in significant reputational damage .\n Investors in all of our carry funds (and certain of our hedge funds) make capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods . Termination of these agreements would cause us to lose the fees we earn from such investment funds . A default by an investor may also limit a fund’s availability to incur borrowings and avail itself of what would otherwise have been available credit .\n If investors fail to satisfy a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds, the operation and performance of those funds could be materially and adversely affected . The use of derivative financial instruments and other risk management strategies may not be properly designed to hedge, manage or otherwise reduce the risks we have identified, such as interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices .\n While such hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail certain other risks . These arrangements may require the posting of cash collateral at a time when a fund has insufficient cash or illiquid assets such that posting of the cash is either impossible or requires the sale of assets at prices at prices that do not reflect their underlying value .\n Investments are subject to the potential for deterioration of real estate fundamentals and the risk of adverse changes in local market and economic conditions . Investments in real estate and real-estate-related businesses and assets may be subject to environmental liabilities, contingent liabilities upon disposition of assets . Natural disasters, natural disasters, climate change related risks, acts of god, terrorist attacks, war, pandemics or other severe public health events are beyond our control .\n Our businesses and assets are subject to changes in law and regulation, including in respect of building, environmental and zoning laws, rent control and other regulations impacting our residential real estate investments . Certain of our investment funds may invest in securities of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings .\n An investment in troubled companies entails the risk that the transaction in which such business enterprise is involved either will be unsuccessful, will take considerable time or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security the value of which will be less than the purchase price to the fund . The fund may be required to sell its investment at a loss .\n An investment fund could be liable for ERISA Title IV pension obligations of its portfolio companies . The investment fund's ownership interest in the portfolio company is significant enough to bring the investment fund within the company’s “controlled group” liability . A number of cases have held that managing investments is not a “trade or business” for tax purposes . A court might hold that one of the fund's portfolio companies could become jointly .\n The development, operation and maintenance of power and energy generation facilities involves many risks, including, as applicable, labor issues, labor risks, breakdown or failure of facilities . Changes in environmental laws or regulations (including climate change initiatives) or the environmental condition of an investment may create liabilities that did not exist at the time of acquisition .\n Our power and energy sector portfolio companies may also face construction risks typical for power generation and related infrastructure businesses . Failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could result in the prevention of operation of certain facilities or the sale of such a facility to a third party . Delays in the completion of any power project may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher operation and maintenance costs .\n The current U.S. Presidential administration and certain members of Congress have expressed support for the repeal of subsidies provided to the clean energy sector by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 . Conversely, legislative efforts by either party to overturn or modify policies or regulations enacted by the prior administration could adversely affect our certain investments .\n Investments in infrastructure assets may expose us to increased risks that are inherent in the ownership of real assets . Infrastructure asset investments may face construction risks including, without limitation, shortages of material and skilled labor, or work stoppages . These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses (which may exceed expected or forecasted budgets)\n The operation of infrastructure assets is exposed to potential unplanned interruptions caused by significant catastrophic or force majeure events . These risks could, among other effects, adversely impact the cash flows available from investments in infrastructure assets, cause personal injury or loss of life, damage property, or instigate disruptions of service . Infrastructure investments may involve the subcontracting of design and construction activities in respect of projects .\n Frastructure investments often involve an ongoing commitment to a municipal, state, federal or foreign government or regulatory agencies . The nature of these obligations exposes us to a higher level of regulatory control than typically imposed on other businesses . Such obligations may require us to rely on complex government licenses, concessions, leases or contracts, which may be difficult to obtain or maintain .\n Our funds’ investments in the life sciences industry may expose us to increased risks . BXLS’s ability to source corporate partnership transactions has been, and will continue, in part dependent on the ability of special purpose development companies to identify, diligence, negotiate and in many cases, take the lead in executing the agreed development plans . Payments under such corporate partnerships are often contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones, including approvals of the applicable product candidate and/or product sales thresholds .\n These companies are subject to the expense, delay and uncertainty of the product approval process, and there can be no guarantee that a particular product candidate will obtain regulatory approval . The current regulatory framework may change or additional regulations may arise at any stage during the product development phase of an investment . In connection with certain corporate partnership transactions, our special purpose development companies will be contractually obligated to run clinical trials .\n Success of a life sciences investment depends in part on the ability of the biopharmaceutical or medical device companies in whose products BXLS invests to obtain and defend patent rights . Successful sale of a company’s product depends on ability to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement from payers . Governments and third-party payers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates .\n The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has indicated the potential for substantial policy and personnel changes . BXLS may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time. This would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself. Our funds may not be able to extend the term of the fund with the consent of fund investors .\n Certain of the funds in which we invest are newly established funds without any operating history or are managed by management companies or general partners who may not have as significant track records as a more established manager . The execution of hedge funds’ investment strategies is subject to the sole discretion of the management company or the general partner of such funds .\n The absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses . Credit risk may arise through a default by one of several large institutions that are dependent on one another to meet their liquidity or operational needs . The efficacy of investment and trading strategies depends largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of financial instruments .\n Hedge funds are subject to risks due to potential illiquidity of assets . Hedge funds may make investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and which may become illiquid . Timely divestiture or sale of trading positions can be impaired by decreased trading volume, increased price volatility, concentrated trading positions, limitations on the ability to transfer positions in highly specialized transactions .\n Investments are subject to risks relating to investments in commodities, futures, options and other derivatives, the prices of which are highly volatile and may be subject to the theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain circumstances . Price movements of commodities are influenced by interest rates, changing supply and demand relationships, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments .\n We are subject to risks in using prime brokers, custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents . A prolonged global failure of cloud services provided to us could result in cascading systems failures . We generally have less control over the delivery of such  services, and as a result, may face disruptions to our ability to operate our business .\n Our funds are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the contract . If a counterparty defaults, we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because we lack contractual recourse or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action .\n In the event of the insolvency of a prime broker, custodian, counterparty or any other party that is holding assets of our funds as collateral, our funds might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full . Under certain local clearing and settlement regimes in Europe, we or our funds could be subject to settlement discipline fines .\n Blackstone Securities Partners L.P. may act as an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent in securities offerings and, through affiliated entities, loan syndications . The consolidation and elimination of counterparties has increased our concentration of counterparty risk and decreased the universe of potential counterparties . We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that, for any reason, we are unable to sell securities or indebtedness we purchased or placed .\n Holders of our common stock are entitled to vote pursuant to Delaware law with respect to: conversion of the legal entity form of Blackstone, transfer, domestication or continuance of  Blackstone to a foreign jurisdiction, change the par value of our . common stock or the powers, preferences or special rights of our. common stock in a way that would affect our common . stock adversely, and amendment of our certificate of incorporation to elect to become a close corporation under Delaware law .\n Holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock and Series I preferred stock may vote to require the Series II Preferred Stockholder to transfer its shares of Series II preferred stock to a successor . As of February 21, 2025, Blackstone Partners L.L.C., an entity owned by the senior managing directors of Blackstone and controlled by Mr. Schwarzman, owned the only share of Series I .\n Certain limits on the ability of the holders of our common stock to call meetings, to acquire information about our operations and to influence the manner or direction of our management . We are not required to file proxy statements or information statements under Section 14 of the Exchange Act except in circumstances where a vote of shareholders is required under our certificate of incorporation or Delaware law .\n Because the Series II Preferred Stockholder holds more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors, we are a “controlled company” and fall within exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements of the rules of the New York Stock Exchange . Pursuant to these exceptions, controlled companies may elect not to comply with certain corporate . governance requirements . Blackstone Group Management L.L.C., an entity owned by senior managing directors of Blackstone .\n The Series II Preferred Stockholder has the ability to influence our business and affairs through its ownership of Series II preferred stock . The holder of our common stock has no ability to remove any of our directors, with or without cause .

The provisions are detrimental to the holders of the common stock because they restrict the remedies available to stockholders for actions of the Series II Prefer Stockholder .\n The Series II Preferred Stockholder or former general partner and certain other specified persons (collectively, the ‘Indemnitees”) are indemnified against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, liabilities and expenses incurred by any Indemnitee . We have also agreed to provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings . A new holder of our Series II preferred stock may appoint directors to our board of directors who have a different philosophy .\n We intend to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock, but our ability to do so may be limited by cash flow from operations and available liquidity, our holding company structure, applicable provisions of Delaware law and contractual restrictions . The declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and may change at any time .\n Blackstone Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue . Our ability to make dividends to stockholders will depend on a number of factors, including among others general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our business and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, including the timing and extent of our realizations, working capital requirements .\n We are amortizing intangibles over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to twenty years, using the hematicallystraight-line-line method . The amortization of these intangible assets will increase our expenses during the relevant periods . These expenses may increase the net loss we record in certain periods or cause us to record a net loss in periods during which we would otherwise have recorded net income .\n A limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships to effect an exchange for a share of common stock . The purchase and subsequent exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets . The IRS may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge .\n As the payments reflect actual tax savings received by Blackstone entities, there may be a timing difference . The amount and timing of any payments under this agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of our common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable . We expect that as a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tax  assets, the payments that we may make under the tax receivable agreements will be substantial .\n If Blackstone Inc. were deemed an “investment company” under the 1940 Act, restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business . We believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of providing asset management and capital markets services . We also believe that the primary source of income from each of our businesses is properly characterized as income earned in exchange for the provision of services .\n We believe that less than 40% of Blackstone Inc.’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis are comprised of assets that could be considered investment securities . The 1940 Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operation of investment companies .\n Blackstone Inc. may be required to limit the amount of investments that we make as a principal or otherwise conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the registration and other requirements of the 1940 Act . Other anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could delay or prevent a change in control .\n The price of our common stock may decline due to the large number of shares eligible for future sale and for exchange . We had a total of 729,415,925 shares of common stock outstanding as of February 21, 2025 .
