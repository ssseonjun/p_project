    "item1": "Item 1, “Business” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn connection with the Merger, we have announced and taken actions to implement projects to achieve cost synergies for the Company. We finalized the framework supporting our ongoing restructuring and transformation initiatives during the year ended December 31, 2022, which included, among other things, strategic content programming assessments, organization restructuring, facility consolidation activities, and other contract termination costs. At that time, we expected to incur approximately $4.1 - $5.3 billion in pre-tax restructuring charges, of which we have incurred $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2024. Of the total expected pre-tax restructuring charges, we expected total cash expenditures to be $1.0 - $1.5 billion. While our restructuring efforts are ongoing, the Merger-related restructuring program was substantially completed at the end of 2024. During 2023, we initiated a strategic realignment plan associated with our Warner Bros. Pictures Animation group and during 2024, we initiated two additional restructuring initiatives; an organizational and personnel restructuring plan and a restructuring initiative associated with our Warner Bros. Games group.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we classified our operations in three reportable segments: \n•\nStudios\n - Our Studios segment primarily consists of the production and release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, production and initial licensing of television programs to our networks/DTC services as well as third parties, distribution of our films and television programs to various third party and internal television and streaming services, distribution through the home entertainment market (physical and digital), related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming.\n33\n•\nNetworks\n - Our Networks segment primarily consists of our domestic and international television networks.\n•\nDTC \n- Our DTC segment primarily consists of our premium pay-TV and streaming services. \nOur segment presentation was aligned with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make decisions about operating matters, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments.\nFor further discussion of financial information for our segments and the geographical areas in which we do business, our content development activities, and revenues, see our business overview set forth in Item 1, “Business” and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForeign Exchange Impacting Comparability\nThe impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons of our results. For example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis (“ex-FX”), in addition to results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-FX excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. The presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe ex-FX change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. The ex-FX change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process (the “2024 Baseline Rate”), and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2024 Baseline Rate. In addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-FX results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities, as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n34\nConsolidated Results of Operations – 2024 vs. 2023\nOur consolidated results of operations for 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions). \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n% Change (ex-FX)\nRevenues:\nDistribution\n$\n19,701 \n$\n20,237 \n(3)\n%\n(1)\n%\nAdvertising\n8,090 \n8,700 \n(7)\n%\n(7)\n%\nContent\n10,297 \n11,203 \n(8)\n%\n(8)\n%\nOther\n1,233 \n1,181 \n4 \n%\n4 \n%\nTotal revenues\n39,321 \n41,321 \n(5)\n%\n(4)\n%\nCosts of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization\n22,970 \n24,526 \n(6)\n%\n(6)\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n9,296 \n9,696 \n(4)\n%\n(3)\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n7,037 \n7,985 \n(12)\n%\n(12)\n%\nRestructuring and other charges\n447 \n585 \n(24)\n%\n(23)\n%\nImpairments and loss on dispositions\n9,603 \n77 \nNM\nNM\nTotal costs and expenses\n49,353 \n42,869 \n15 \n%\n16 \n%\nOperating loss\n(10,032)\n(1,548)\nNM\nNM\nInterest expense, net\n(2,017)\n(2,221)\nGain on extinguishment of debt\n632 \n17 \nLoss from equity investees, net\n(121)\n(82)\nOther income (expense), net\n150 \n(29)\nLoss before income taxes\n(11,388)\n(3,863)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n(94)\n784 \nNet loss\n(11,482)\n(3,079)\nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n129 \n(38)\nNet loss (income) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests\n42 \n(9)\nNet loss available to Warner Bros.

The ex-FX percent changes of line items below operating loss in the table above are not included as the activity is principally in U.S. dollars.\nRevenues\nDistribution revenues are generated from fees charged to network distributors, which include cable, DTH satellite, telecommunications and digital service providers, and DTC subscribers. The largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution rights to our networks from cable, DTH satellite, and telecommunication service providers. We have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world, including the largest operators in the U.S. and major international distributors. Distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks, the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement, and the market demand for the content that we provide. From time to time, renewals of multi-year carriage agreements include significant year one market adjustments to reset subscriber rates. In some cases, we have provided distributors launch incentives, in the form of cash payments or free periods, to carry our networks. \nDistribution revenue decreased 1% in 2024, primarily attributable to an 8% decline in Networks domestic linear subscribers and our exit from our regional sports business (“AT&T SportsNets”) in the U.S., which had an unfavorable impact of $225 million for the year, partially offset by a 5% increase in domestic contractual affiliate rates, a 20% increase in DTC subscribers, and an increase in pricing following the launch of Max in Europe in 2024.\n35\nAdvertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of commercial time on linear (television networks and authenticated TVE applications) and digital platforms (DTC subscription services and websites), and sold primarily on a national basis in the U.S. and on a pan-regional or local-language feed basis outside the U.S. Advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less. Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, the stage of development of television markets, and the popularity of free-to-air television. Revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality, market-based variations, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and general economic conditions. Advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved. We also generate revenue from the sale of advertising through our digital platforms on a stand-alone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks.\nAdvertising revenue decreased 7% in 2024, primarily attributable to audience declines in domestic linear networks of 18%, partially offset by an increase in domestic Max ad-lite subscribers.\nContent revenues are generated from the release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, production of programs licensed for initial television/SVOD exhibition, the additional licensing of feature films and television programs to various television, SVOD and other digital markets, distribution of feature films and television programs in the physical and digital home entertainment market, sales of console games and mobile in-game content, sublicensing of sports rights, and licensing of intellectual property such as characters and brands.\nContent revenue decreased 8% in 2024, primarily attributable to a 53% decrease in games revenue due to the strong performance of the 2023 slate, including \nHogwarts Legacy\n, compared to the 2024 slate, and a 4% decrease in theatrical product revenue due to the strong prior year performance of \nBarbie\n, which was released in 2023, partially offset by the sublicensing of Olympic sports rights in Europe in the current year, which had a favorable impact of $576 million in 2024.\nOther revenue primarily consists of studio production services and tours. \nOther revenue increased 4% in 2024, primarily attributable to the opening of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo in June 2023, partially offset by the timing of services provided to the unconsolidated TNT Sports UK joint venture.\nCosts of Revenues\nOur principal component of costs of revenues is content expense. Content expense includes television/digital series, specials, films, games, and sporting events. Amortization related to both historical cost basis and any fair value adjustments to content arising from business combinations is included in costs of revenues. The costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of production costs, participation costs, and exploitation costs.\nCosts of revenues decreased 6% in 2024, primarily attributable to lower content expense related to the amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, lower content expense commensurate with lower content revenue at DTC, and our exit from the AT&T SportsNet business, partially offset by the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year. The exit from the AT&T SportsNet business had a favorable impact to costs of revenues of $277 million for the year. The broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year had an unfavorable impact to costs of revenues of $664 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy, and back office support fees.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3% in 2024, primarily attributable to lower marketing costs due to lower theatrical and games marketing expenses and the prior year launch of Max in the U.S., partially offset by the continuation of Max launches internationally.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased 12% in 2024, primarily attributable to intangible assets acquired during the Merger that are being amortized on an accelerated basis, partially offset by the shortening of the useful lives of certain intangible assets. (See Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nRestructuring and other charges decreased 23% in 2024. Restructuring and other charges primarily includes contract terminations, facility consolidation activities, organizational restructuring, and other charges. (See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\n36\nImpairments and Loss on Dispositions\nImpairments and loss on dispositions was a\n \n$9,603 million\n \nand\n \n$77 million loss in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The loss in 2024 was primarily attributable to a $9.1 billion pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Networks reporting unit during the second quarter of 2024 (see Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and $411 million right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) impairment charges primarily related to the Hudson Yards, New York office lease. (See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) The loss in 2023 was primarily attributable to lease ROU asset impairments and costs associated with our exit from AT&T SportsNets.\nInterest Expense, net\nActual interest expense, net decreased $204 million in 2024, primarily attributable to lower debt during the period. (See Note 11 and Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nGain on extinguishment of debt\nDuring 2024, we repaid in full at maturity $40 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our floating rate notes due March 2024 and we repurchased or repaid $5,923 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes. (See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nLoss from Equity Investees, net\nActual losses from our equity method investees were $121 million and $82 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The losses are attributable to our share of earnings and losses from our equity investees. (See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net was $150 million and $(29) million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase\n \nwas primarily attributable to our gain on sale of equity method investments and an increase to the Merger related tax indemnification receivable accrual, partially offset by foreign currency losses. (See Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $94 million and $(784) million, and the Company’s effective tax rate was (1)% and 20% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $9.1 billion, the majority of which was not deductible for tax purposes. (See Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) For the year ended December 31, 2024, the increase in income tax expense compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in pre-tax book loss (excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge), an increase in state and local income taxes (including a state deferred tax adjustment recorded in the year ended December 31, 2024 and a one-time favorable release of an unrecognized state tax benefit in 2023 that did not recur in 2024), and a one-time favorable release of an unrecognized U.S. tax benefit in 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n \n(See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nIncome tax expense for 2024 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory tax rate primarily attributable to the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and the effect of foreign operations.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (“GloBE”) model rules, issued under the OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, introduce a global minimum tax of 15% applicable to multinational enterprise groups with consolidated financial statement revenue in excess of €750 million. Numerous foreign jurisdictions have already enacted tax legislation based on the GloBE rules, with some effective as early as January 1, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we recognized a nominal income tax expense for Pillar Two GloBE minimum tax. The Company is continuously monitoring the evolving application of this legislation and assessing its potential impact on our future tax liability.\n37\nSegment Results of Operations – 2024 vs. 2023\nThe Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding: \n•\nemployee share-based compensation;\n•\ndepreciation and amortization;\n•\nrestructuring and facility consolidation;\n•\ncertain impairment charges;\n•\ngains and losses on business and asset dispositions;\n•\nthird-party transaction and integration costs;\n•\namortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content;\n•\namortization of capitalized interest for content; and\n•\nother items impacting comparability. \nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company’s operating segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to assess the operating results and performance of the segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. (See Note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) \nThe table below presents our Adjusted EBITDA by segment (in millions).\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n% Change\nStudios\n$\n1,652 \n$\n2,183 \n(24)\n%\nNetworks\n8,149 \n9,063 \n(10)\n%\nDTC\n677 \n103 \nNM\nCorporate\n(1,260)\n(1,242)\n(1)\n%\nInter-segment eliminations \n(186)\n93 \nNM\n38\n Studios Segment \nThe following table presents, for our Studios segment, revenues by type, certain operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income (in millions).\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n% Change\n% Change (ex-FX)\nRevenues:\nDistribution\n$\n8 \n$\n17 \n(53)\n%\n(53)\n%\nAdvertising\n5 \n15 \n(67)\n%\n(67)\n%\nContent\n10,717 \n11,358 \n(6)\n%\n(5)\n%\nOther\n877 \n802 \n9 \n%\n9 \n%\nTotal revenues\n11,607 \n12,192 \n(5)\n%\n(5)\n%\nCosts of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization\n7,530 \n7,296 \n3 \n%\n3 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n2,425 \n2,713 \n(11)\n%\n(11)\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n1,652 \n2,183 \n(24)\n%\n(23)\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n702 \n667 \nEmployee share-based compensation\n(1)\n— \nRestructuring and other charges\n263 \n225 \nTransaction and integration costs \n2 \n7 \nFacility consolidation costs\n1 \n— \nImpairment and amortization of fair value step-up for content\n96 \n995 \nAmortization of capitalized interest for content\n46 \n46 \nInter-segment eliminations\n— \n31 \nImpairments and loss on dispositions\n14 \n1 \nOperating income\n$\n529 \n$\n211 \nUnless otherwise indicated, the discussion of percent changes below is on an ex-FX basis. The Studios discussion below also includes intra-segment revenue and expense between product lines, which represented less than 3% of total revenues and operating expenses for this segment for the year ended December 31, 2024. Intra-segment revenue and expense are eliminated at the Studios segment level.\nFluctuations in results for our Studios segment may occur due to various factors, including (but not limited to) the timing and number of new film releases each quarter, the timing of marketing expenses recognized relative to (i.e., prior to) a film’s release, and the mix of content distributed each period.\nRevenues\nContent revenue decreased\n \n5% in 2024, primarily attributable to a 53% decrease in games revenue, and a 4% decrease in theatrical product revenue, partially offset by a 9% increase in television product revenue.\n•\nThe decrease in games revenue was primarily attributable to the strong performance of the 2023 slate, including \nHogwarts Legacy\n, compared to the 2024 slate.\n•\nThe decrease in theatrical product revenue was attributable to lower film rental revenue and intra-segment licensing revenue, partially offset by higher home entertainment revenue. Film rental revenue decreased due to the strong prior year performance of \nBarbie\n, which was released in 2023, partially offset by higher carryover releases from 2023 compared to 2022. Home entertainment revenue increased due to the performance of \nDune: Part Two,\n \nGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire, Wonka, Aquaman 2, \nand\n Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\n and higher catalog sales.\n•\nThe increase in television product revenue was attributable to higher intercompany content sales and higher initial telecast revenue due to the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes in the prior year, partially offset by lower third-party content sales.\nOther revenue increased\n \n9% in 2024, primarily attributable to the opening of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo in June 2023.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues increased\n \n3% in 2024, primarily attributable to a 4% increase in theatrical product content expense due to product mix and higher development costs, and a 1% increase in games content expense due to impairments of $384 million, partially offset by lower intra-segment licensing costs. Television product content expense was flat in 2024, as higher content expense commensurate with higher revenues was offset by favorable product mix and lower development costs.\n39\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 11% in 2024, primarily attributable to lower theatrical marketing expenses due to fewer new releases and lower games marketing expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 23% in 2024.\nNetworks Segment \nThe table below presents, for our Networks segment, revenues by type, certain operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating (loss) income (in millions).\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n% Change\n% Change (ex-FX)\nRevenues:\nDistribution\n$\n10,680 \n$\n11,521 \n(7)\n%\n(6)\n%\nAdvertising\n7,306 \n8,342 \n(12)\n%\n(12)\n%\nContent\n1,848 \n1,005 \n84 \n%\n83 \n%\nOther\n341 \n376 \n(9)\n%\n(10)\n%\nTotal revenues\n20,175 \n21,244 \n(5)\n%\n(4)\n%\nCosts of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization\n9,238 \n9,342 \n(1)\n%\n— \n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n2,788 \n2,839 \n(2)\n%\n(1)\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n8,149 \n9,063 \n(10)\n%\n(10)\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n4,172 \n4,961 \nRestructuring and other charges\n85 \n201 \nTransaction and integration costs\n2 \n3 \nImpairment and amortization of fair value step-up for content\n495 \n473 \nInter-segment eliminations\n— \n90 \nImpairments and loss on dispositions\n9,154 \n13 \nOperating (loss) income\n$\n(5,759)\n$\n3,322 \nUnless otherwise indicated, the discussion of percent changes below is on an ex-FX basis.\nRevenues\nDistribution revenue decreased 6% in 2024, primarily attributable to an 8% decline in domestic linear subscribers for the year, partially offset by a 5% increase in domestic contractual affiliate rates. In addition, the exit from the AT&T SportsNet business had an unfavorable impact of $225 million for the year. Declines in linear subscribers are expected to continue.\nAdvertising revenue decreased 12% in 2024, primarily attributable to audience declines in domestic networks of 18%\n \nfor the year, and continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market.\nContent revenue increased by 83% in 2024, primarily attributable to\n \nthe sublicensing of Olympic sports rights in Europe in the current year, which had a favorable impact of $576 million, and timing of third-party licensing deals.\nOther revenue decreased\n \n10% in 2024, primarily attributable to the timing of services provided to the unconsolidated TNT Sports UK joint venture.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues was flat in 2024. Sports-related content expense increased in 2024 primarily due to the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe in the current year and the acquisition of new sports rights, partially offset by our exit from the AT&T SportsNet business and the allocation of U.S. sports costs to DTC. The increase in sports-related content expense was further offset by lower entertainment content expense in 2024. Our exit from the AT&T SportsNet business had a favorable impact to costs of revenues of $277 million and the broadcast of the Olympics in Europe had an unfavorable impact to costs of revenues of $664 million in the current year.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% in 2024.\n40\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 10% in 2024.\n DTC Segment \nThe following table presents, for our DTC segment, revenues by type, certain operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss (in millions).\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n% Change\n% Change (ex-FX)\nRevenues:\nDistribution\n$\n9,022 \n$\n8,703 \n4 \n%\n5 \n%\nAdvertising\n855 \n548 \n56 \n%\n57 \n%\nContent\n428 \n886 \n(52)\n%\n(51)\n%\nOther\n8 \n17 \n(53)\n%\n(50)\n%\nTotal revenues\n10,313 \n10,154 \n2 \n%\n2 \n%\nCosts of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization\n7,459 \n7,623 \n(2)\n%\n(2)\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n2,177 \n2,428 \n(10)\n%\n(9)\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n677 \n103 \nNM\nNM\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,831 \n2,063 \nRestructuring and other charges\n3 \n66 \nTransaction and integration costs \n(1)\n4 \nImpairment and amortization of fair value step-up for content\n282 \n460 \nInter-segment eliminations\n— \n72 \nImpairments and loss on dispositions\n47 \n3 \nOperating loss\n$\n(1,485)\n$\n(2,565)\nUnless otherwise indicated, the discussion of percent changes below is on an ex-FX basis.\nRevenues\nSubscriber information (as defined under Item 1. “Business”) consisted of the following (in millions).\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n% Change\nTotal Domestic subscribers\n57.1 \n52.0 \n10 \n%\nTotal International subscribers\n59.8 \n45.6 \n31 \n%\nTotal DTC subscribers\n116.9 \n97.7 \n20 \n%\nDistribution revenue increased\n \n5% in 2024, primarily attributable to a\n \n20%\n \nincrease in subscribers and an increase in pricing following the launch of Max in Europe and Latin America in 2024, partially offset by continued domestic linear wholesale subscriber declines.\nAdvertising revenue increased 57% in 2024, primarily attributable to an increase in domestic ad-lite subscribers.\n41\nGlobal ARPU consisted of the following.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% Change (ex-FX)\nDomestic ARPU\n$\n11.89 \n$\n11.20 \n6 \n%\nInternational ARPU\n$\n3.85 \n$\n3.85 \n4 \n%\nGlobal ARPU\n1\n$\n7.76 \n$\n7.78 \n1 \n%\nGlobal ARPU increased 1% in 2024, primarily attributable to subscriber growth of the ad-lite tier domestically, higher pricing, and a continuing subscriber mix shift from linear wholesale, partially offset by growth in lower ARPU international markets.\nContent revenue decreased\n \n51%\n \nin 2024, primarily attributable to fewer third-party licensing deals.\nCosts of Revenues\nCost of revenues decreased\n \n2% in 2024, primarily attributable to lower content expense commensurate with lower content revenue, partially offset by the allocation of U.S. sports from the Networks segment.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased\n \n9% in 2024, primarily attributable to lower marketing costs due to the launch of Max in 2023 in the U.S., partially offset by higher overhead expenses and the continuation of Max launches internationally.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased\n \n$574 million\n \nin 2024.

Where daily values are not available, the sum of beginning of period and end of period divided by two is used.\nExcluded from the ARPU calculation are: (i) Revenue and subscribers for DTC products, other than discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, a Premium Sports Product, and independently-branded, regional products (currently consisting of TVN/Player and BluTV), that may be offered by us or by certain joint venture partners or affiliated parties from time to time; (ii) A limited amount of international discovery+ revenue and subscribers that are part of non-strategic partnerships or short-term arrangements as may be identified by the Company from time to time; (iii) Cinemax, Max/HBO hotel and bulk institution (i.e., subscribers billed on a bulk basis), and international basic HBO revenue and subscribers; and (iv) Users on free trials who convert to a subscription for which we have recognized subscription revenue within the first seven days of the calendar month immediately following the month in which their free trial expires.\n42\nInter-segment Eliminations\nThe following table presents our inter-segment eliminations by revenue and expense, Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss (in millions): \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nInter-segment revenue eliminations\n$\n(2,782)\n$\n(2,269)\nInter-segment expense eliminations\n(2,596)\n(2,362)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(186)\n93 \nRestructuring and other charges\n— \n(2)\nImpairment and amortization of fair value step-up for content\n264 \n451 \nOperating loss\n$\n(450)\n$\n(356)\nInter-segment revenue and expense eliminations primarily represent inter-segment content transactions and marketing and promotion activity between reportable segments. In our current segment structure, in certain instances, production and distribution activities are in different segments. Inter-segment content transactions are generally presented at market value (i.e., the segment producing and/or licensing the content reports revenue and profit from inter-segment transactions in a manner similar to the reporting of third-party transactions, and the required eliminations are reported on the separate “Eliminations” line when presenting our summary of segment results). Generally, timing of revenue recognition is similar to the reporting of third-party transactions. The segment distributing the content, e.g., via our DTC or linear services, capitalizes the cost of inter-segment content transactions, including “mark-ups” and amortizes the costs over the shorter of the license term, if applicable, or the expected period of use. The content amortization expense related to the inter-segment profit is also eliminated on the separate “Eliminations” line when presenting our summary of segment results.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nSources of Cash\nHistorically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. During 2024, we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had $5.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. We are a well-known seasoned issuer and have the ability to conduct registered offerings of securities, including debt securities, common stock and preferred stock, on short notice, subject to market conditions. Access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured. We have a $6.0 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program described below. We also participate in a revolving receivables program and an accounts receivable factoring program described below.\n•\nDebt\nSenior Notes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued €650 million of 4.302% fixed rate senior notes due January 2030 and €850 million of 4.693% fixed rate senior notes due May 2033. After December 2029 and February 2033, respectively, the senior notes are redeemable at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. \nRevolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper\nWe have a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) and have the capacity to borrow up to $6.0 billion under the Credit Agreement (the “Credit Facility”). We may also request additional commitments up to $1.0 billion from the lenders upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the Credit Agreement. \nAdditionally, our commercial paper program is supported by the Credit Facility. Under the commercial paper program, we may issue up to $1.0 billion. Borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility is effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we borrowed and repaid $14,203 million under our Credit Facility and commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility or the commercial paper program. \n43\nTerm Loans\nIn January 2025, we entered into a new $1,500 million 364-day senior unsecured term loan credit facility. The proceeds were used to the fund the redemption of $1,500 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.412% senior notes due 2026.\n•\nRevolving Receivables Program\nWe have a revolving agreement to transfer up to $5,200 million of certain receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, Warner Bros. Discovery Receivables Funding, LLC, to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. We service the sold receivables for the financial institution for a fee and pay fees to the financial institution in connection with this revolving agreement. As customers pay their balances, our available capacity under this revolving agreement increases and typically we transfer additional receivables into the program. In some cases, we may have collections that have not yet been remitted to the bank, resulting in a liability. The outstanding portfolio of receivables derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets was $4,637 million as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nWe have a factoring agreement to sell certain of our non-U.S. trade accounts receivable on a limited recourse basis to a third-party financial institution. For the year ended December 31, 2024, total trade accounts receivable sold under our factoring arrangement was $313 million.\n•\nInvestments\nIn May 2024, we sold our 50% interest in All3Media, an equity method investment, for proceeds of $324 million.\nIn October 2024, we sold our minority interests in Formula E, which were recorded as an equity method investment and an investment without readily determinable fair value, to Liberty Global, a related party, for total proceeds of $217 million.\n•\nDerivatives\nWe received investing proceeds of $136 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 from the unwind and settlement of derivative instruments. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nUses of Cash\nOur primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, income taxes, personnel costs, costs to develop and market our enhanced streaming service Max, principal and interest payments on our outstanding senior notes, funding for various equity method and other investments, and repurchases of our capital stock.\n•\nContent Acquisition\nWe plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content, as well as certain sports rights. Additional information regarding contractual commitments to acquire content is set forth in “Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n•\nDebt\nFloating Rate Notes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repaid $40 million of aggregate principal amount of our floating rate notes due March 2024. \nSenior Notes\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased or repaid $5,923 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes. In addition, we have $2,748 million of senior notes coming due in 2025.\nIn February 2025, we redeemed in full $1,500 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.412% senior notes due 2026. The redemption was funded with the proceeds of borrowings pursuant to the new $1,500 million 364-day senior unsecured term loan credit facility entered into in January 2025.\nWe may from time to time seek to prepay, retire or purchase our other outstanding indebtedness through prepayments, redemptions, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Any such repurchases or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, as well as applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we repurchase or exchange any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases or exchanges will be determined at our discretion.\n44\n•\nCapital Expenditures\nWe effected capital expenditures of $948 million in 2024, including amounts capitalized to support Max. In addition, we expect to continue to\n \nincur significant costs to develop and market Max.\n•\nInvestments and Business Combinations\nOur uses of cash have included investments in equity method investments and equity investments without readily determinable fair value. (See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) We also provide funding to our investees from time to time. We contributed $109 million and $112 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, for investments in and advances to our investees.\n•\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest and Noncontrolling Interest\nWe had redeemable equity balances of $109 million at December 31, 2024, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to us. Distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests totaled $193 million and $301 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n•\nCommon Stock Repurchases\nHistorically, we have funded our stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and the issuance of debt. In February 2020, our board of directors authorized additional stock repurchases of up to $2 billion upon completion of our existing $1 billion authorization announced in May 2019. Under the new stock repurchase authorization, management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases at prevailing prices or privately negotiated purchases subject to market conditions and other factors. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) There were no common stock repurchases during 2024 or 2023.\n•\nIncome Taxes and Interest\nWe expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes.\n \nDuring 2024 and 2023, we made cash payments of $1,113 million and $1,440 million for income taxes and $1,996 million and $2,237 million for interest on our outstanding debt, respectively.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents changes in cash and cash equivalents (in millions).\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period\n$\n4,319 \n$\n3,930 \nCash provided by operating activities\n5,375 \n7,477 \nCash used in investing activities\n(349)\n(1,259)\nCash used in financing activities\n(3,749)\n(5,837)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n(180)\n8 \nNet change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n1,097 \n389 \nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period\n$\n5,416 \n$\n4,319 \nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $5,375 million and $7,477 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income excluding non-cash items. Cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2023 was also positively impacted by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $349 million and $1,259 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to higher proceeds from the sale of investments and fewer purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $3,749 million and $5,837 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to lower net debt activity and lower distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n45\nCapital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2024, capital resources were comprised of the following (in millions).\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \nTotal\nCapacity\nOutstanding\nIndebtedness\nUnused\nCapacity\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n5,312 \n$\n— \n$\n5,312 \nRevolving credit facility and commercial paper program\n6,000 \n— \n6,000 \nSenior notes \n(a)\n39,527 \n39,527 \n— \nTotal\n$\n50,839 \n$\n39,527 \n$\n11,312 \n(a) \nInterest on senior notes is paid annually, semi-annually, or quarterly. Our senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2024 had interest rates that ranged from 1.90% to 8.30% and will mature between 2025 and 2062.\nWe expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations, and availability under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for both the short-term and the long-term. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. Credit rating agencies may continue to review and adjust our ratings or outlook. For example, in 2024, S&P and Moody’s revised our ratings outlook from stable to negative in part due to declines in our linear business, including as a result of the weak operating environment for linear networks, and our leverage ratio.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposed a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest some of these funds outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the U.S. However, if these funds were to be needed in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay non-U.S. taxes to repatriate them. The determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.\nMATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS FROM KNOWN CONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2024, our significant contractual and other obligations were as follows (in millions).\nTotal\nShort-term\nLong-term\nLong-term debt:\nPrincipal payments\n$\n39,527 \n$\n2,749 \n$\n36,778 \nInterest payments\n27,336 \n1,792 \n25,544 \nPurchase obligations:\nContent\n21,530 \n5,956 \n15,574 \nOther\n2,911 \n1,119 \n1,792 \nFinance lease obligations\n535 \n130 \n405 \nOperating lease obligations\n3,902 \n432 \n3,470 \nPension and other employee obligations\n1,422 \n494 \n928 \nTotal\n$\n97,163 \n$\n12,672 \n$\n84,491 \nLong-term Debt\nPrincipal payments on long-term debt reflect the repayment of our outstanding senior notes, at face value, assuming repayment will occur upon maturity. Interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are projected based on their contractual interest rates and maturity dates.\nAdditionally, we have a multicurrency revolving Credit Agreement and have the capacity to borrow up to $6.0 billion under the Credit Facility. We may also request additional commitments up to $1.0 billion from the lenders upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. Additionally, our commercial paper program is supported by the Credit Facility. Under the commercial paper program, we may issue up to $1.0 billion. Borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility is effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility or the commercial paper program. (See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\n46\nPurchase Obligations\nContent purchase obligations include commitments associated with third-party producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks and DTC services. Production and licensing contracts generally require the purchase of a specified number of episodes and payments during production or over the term of a license, and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place. If the content is ultimately never produced, our commitments expire without obligation. We expect to enter into additional production contracts and content licenses to meet our future content needs.\nOther purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. Significant purchase obligations include transmission services, television rating services, marketing commitments and research, equipment purchases, and information technology and other services. Some of these contracts do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30-day to 60-day advance notice without penalty, and are not included in the table above past the 30-day to 60-day advance notice period. Other purchase obligations also include future funding commitments to equity method investees. Although the Company had funding commitments to equity method investees as of December 31, 2024, the Company may also provide uncommitted additional funding to its equity method investments in the future. (See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nContent and other purchase obligations presented above exclude liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheets.\nFinance Lease Obligations\nWe acquire satellite transponders and other equipment through multi-year finance lease arrangements. Principal payments on finance lease obligations reflect amounts due under our finance lease agreements. Interest payments on our outstanding finance lease obligations are based on the stated or implied rate in our finance lease agreements. (See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nOperating Lease Obligations\nWe obtain office space and equipment under multi-year lease arrangements. Most operating leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration. Payments for operating leases represent the amounts due under the agreements assuming the agreements are not canceled prior to their expiration. (See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nPension and Other Employee Obligations\nThe Company participates in and/or sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan that covers certain U.S. based employees and several U.S. and non-U.S. nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that are noncontributory (“Pension Plans”). The Company’s Pension Plans consist of both funded and unfunded plans. (See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nContractual commitments include payments to meet minimum funding requirements of our Pension Plans in 2025 and estimated benefit payments. Benefit payments have been estimated over a ten-year period. While benefit payments under the Pension Plans are expected to continue beyond 2034, we believe it is not practicable to estimate payments beyond this period.\nOther employee obligations are primarily related to employment agreements with creative talent for certain broadcast networks.\nWe are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount of any payments due to cash-settled share-based compensation awards. As of December 31, 2024, the current portion of the liability for cash-settled share-based compensation awards was $27 million.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAlthough we can reasonably estimate the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to certain of the Company’s uncertain tax positions that may decrease over the next twelve months, we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.\n47\nSix Flags Guarantee\nIn connection with the WarnerMedia Business’ former investment in the Six Flags (as defined below) theme parks located in Georgia and Texas (collectively, the “Parks”), in 1997, certain subsidiaries of the Company agreed to guarantee (the “Six Flags Guarantee”) certain obligations of the partnerships that hold the Parks (the “Partnerships”) for the benefit of the limited partners in such Partnerships, including annual payments made to the Parks or to the limited partners and additional obligations at the end of the respective terms for the Partnerships in 2027 and 2028 (the “Guaranteed Obligations”). Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (formerly known as Six Flags, Inc. and Premier Parks Inc.) (“Six Flags”), which has the controlling interest in the Parks, has agreed, pursuant to a subordinated indemnity agreement (the “Subordinated Indemnity Agreement”), to guarantee the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations when due and to indemnify the Company, among others, if the Six Flags Guarantee is called upon. If Six Flags defaults on its indemnification obligations, the Company has the right to acquire control of the managing partner of the Parks. Six Flags’ obligations to the Company are further secured by its interest in all limited partnership units held by Six Flags.\nIn December 2024, Six Flags provided notice of its exercise of the option related to the theme parks located in Georgia that requires the redemption of all the limited partnership units that Six Flags does not then own in the Georgia Partnership in January 2027. Pursuant to the exercise of the option, all of such outstanding limited partnership interests will be redeemed, and Six Flags will also acquire certain related entity general partnership and managing member interests.\nBased on the Company’s evaluation of the current facts and circumstances surrounding the Guaranteed Obligations and the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement, it is unable to predict the loss, if any, that may be incurred under the Guaranteed Obligations, and no liability for the arrangements has been recognized as of December 31, 2024. Because of the specific circumstances surrounding the arrangements and the fact that no active or observable market exists for this type of financial guarantee, the Company is unable to determine a current fair value for the Guaranteed Obligations and related Subordinated Indemnity Agreement. The aggregate gross undiscounted estimated future cash flow requirements covered by the Six Flags Guarantee over the remaining term (through 2028) are $589 million. To date, no payments have been made by the Company pursuant to the Six Flags Guarantee.\nOther Contingent Commitments\nOther contingent commitments primarily include contingent payments for post-production term advance obligations on a certain co-financing arrangement, as well as operating lease commitment guarantees, letters of credit, bank guarantees, and surety bonds, which generally support performance and payments for a wide range of global contingent and firm obligations, including insurance, litigation appeals, real estate leases, and other operational needs. Our other contingent commitments at December 31, 2024 were immaterial.\nPut Rights\nWe have granted put rights to certain consolidated subsidiaries, but we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any payment. We recorded the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in the equity associated with the put rights as a component of redeemable noncontrolling interest in the amount of $109 million. (See Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nNoncontrolling Interest\nThe Food Network and Cooking Channel are operated and organized under the terms of the TV Food Network Partnership (the “Partnership”). We hold interests in the Partnership, along with another noncontrolling owner. The Partnership agreement specifies a dissolution date of December 31, 2025. If the term of the Partnership is not extended prior to that date, the Partnership agreement permits us, as holder of 80% of the applicable votes, to reconstitute the Partnership and continue its business. If for some reason the Partnership is not continued, it will be required to limit its activities to winding up, settling debts, liquidating assets and distributing proceeds to the partners in proportion to their partnership interests.\nSummarized Guarantor Financial Information\nBasis of Presentation\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has outstanding senior notes issued by Discovery Communications, LLC (“DCL”), which are guaranteed by the Company, Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. (“Scripps Networks”), and WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc. (“WMH”); senior notes issued by WMH, which are guaranteed by the Company, Scripps Networks, and DCL; senior notes issued by the legacy WarnerMedia Business (not guaranteed); and senior notes issued by Scripps Networks (not guaranteed). (See Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) DCL, Scripps Networks, and WMH are wholly owned by the Company.\n48\nThe tables below present the summarized financial information as combined for Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.

Information regarding transactions and amounts with related parties is discussed in Note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNEW ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nWe adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2024. Information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. \n49\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to unrecognized tax benefits, goodwill and intangible assets, content rights, consolidation and revenue recognition. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. \nManagement considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. \nThe development and selection of these critical accounting estimates have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the board of directors of the Company. We believe the following accounting estimates are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe are subject to income taxes in numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, we engage in transactions or take filing positions in which the tax consequences may be uncertain and may recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. We establish a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits unless we determine that such positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits, including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes. We include interest and where appropriate, potential penalties, as a component of income tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events including the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities. Significant judgment is exercised in evaluating all relevant information, the technical merits of the tax positions, and the accurate measurement of unrecognized tax benefits when determining the amount of reserve and whether positions taken on our tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained. This also involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the potential outcome of positions taken on tax returns that may be reviewed by tax authorities. \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments (the component level). Reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics. Our reporting units are Studios, Networks, and DTC.\nWe evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions, industry trends, costs, cash flows, or ongoing declines in market capitalization. If we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative impairment test requires significant judgment in determining the fair value of the reporting units. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method and the market multiple approach, which incorporates the use of EBITDA and revenue multiples based on market data. For the DCF method, we use projections specific to the reporting unit, as well as those based on general economic conditions, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Determining fair value specific to each reporting unit requires us to exercise judgment when selecting the appropriate discount rates, control premiums, terminal growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including revenue growth rates and profit margins. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis for each reporting unit are based on the reporting unit’s budget, long range plan, and recent operating performance. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions.\n2024 Impairment Analysis\nDuring the second quarter 2024, we performed goodwill and intangible assets impairment monitoring procedures for all of our reporting units and concluded the delta between market capitalization and book value, continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market, and uncertainty related to affiliate and sports rights renewals, including the NBA, represented a triggering event for the Networks reporting unit.\n50\nAs a result, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment assessment for all of our reporting units in the second quarter of 2024. For the Networks reporting unit, fair value was determined using a DCF method. The key judgments and assumptions used in the DCF method to determine the fair value of the Networks reporting unit were as follows:\n•    The expected future cash flows in terms of their amount and timing. These cash flows, utilized in the DCF analysis, are derived from the reporting unit’s budget and its strategic long-term plan, which reflect expectations based upon operating performance and assumptions consistent with those of a market participant with regards to affiliate revenue, sports rights, and continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market.\n•    Long-term growth rate of negative 3%.\n•    A discount rate of 10.5%. This is reflective of the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit and market conditions.\n Given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a DCF analysis, actual results may differ from those used in the valuations.\nThe carrying value of the Networks reporting unit exceeded its fair value and we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $9.1 billion during the second quarter of 2024 in impairments and loss on dispositions in the consolidated statements of operations. The goodwill impairment charge does not have an impact on the calculation of our financial covenants under our debt arrangements.\nAs of October 1, 2024, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all of our reporting units. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, no impairment was recorded. The DTC reporting unit had headroom of 20%. The Studios reporting unit, which had headroom of 16%, and the Networks reporting unit, which had headroom of 12%, both had fair values in excess of carrying value of less than 20%. The fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of DCF and market valuation methodologies. A 0.5% increase in the discount rate and a 1% decrease in the long-term growth rate would not result in an impairment loss across the reporting units.\nWe continue to monitor our reporting units for triggers that could impact the recoverability of goodwill. Long-term trends and risks we are monitoring in our ongoing assessment include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nthe delta between market capitalization and book value;\n•\nuncertainty related to affiliate rights renewals associated with our Networks and DTC reporting units;\n•\ndeclining levels of global GDP growth and continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market associated with our Networks reporting unit;\n•\ncontent licensing trends and volatility related to the performance of theatrical film and game slates in our Studios reporting unit; and\n•\nrisks in executing the projected growth strategies of our DTC reporting unit.\nContent Rights\nWe capitalize the costs to produce or acquire feature films and television programs, and we amortize costs and test for impairment based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually, or as a group.\nFor films and television programs predominantly monetized individually, the amount of capitalized film and television production costs (net of incentives) amortized and the amount of participations and residuals to be recognized as expense in a particular period are determined using the individual film forecast method. Under this method, the amortization of capitalized costs and the accrual of participations and residuals are based on the proportion of the film’s or television program’s revenues recognized for such period to the film’s or television program’s estimated remaining ultimate revenues (i.e., the total revenue to be received throughout a film’s or television program’s remaining life cycle).\nFor theatrical films, which are monetized on an individual basis, the process of estimating ultimate revenues requires us to make a series of judgments related to future revenue-generating activities associated with a particular film. Prior to the theatrical release of a film, our estimates are based on factors such as the historical performance of similar films, the star power of the lead actors, the rating and genre of the film, pre-release market research (including test market screenings), international distribution plans and the expected number of theaters in which the film will be released. Subsequent to release, ultimate revenues are updated to reflect initial performance, which is often predictive of future performance.\nFor television programs that are monetized on an individual basis, ultimate revenues are estimated based on factors including the performance of similar programs in each applicable market, firm commitments in hand from customers that license the program in the future, and the popularity of the program in its initial markets.\n51\nFor a film or television program that is predominantly monetized on its own but also monetized with other films and/or programs (such as on our DTC or linear services), we make a reasonable estimate of the value attributable to the film or program’s exploitation while monetized with other films/programs, based on relative market rates, and expense such costs as the film or television program is exhibited.\nUltimates for content monetized on an individual basis are reviewed and updated (as applicable) on a quarterly basis; any adjustments are applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year of the change.\nFor programs monetized as a group, including licensed programming, amortization expense for network programs is generally based on projected usage, generally resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. Adjustments for projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Streaming and premium pay-TV content amortization is based on estimated viewing patterns, as there are generally limited to no direct revenues to associate to the individual content assets for premium pay-TV. As such, viewership is most representative of the use of the title.\nJudgment is required to determine the useful lives and amortization patterns of our content assets that are predominantly monetized as a group. Critical assumptions include: (i) the grouping of content with similar characteristics, (ii) the application of a quantitative revenue forecast model or historical viewership model based on the adequacy of historical data, and (iii) determining the appropriate historical periods to utilize and the relative weighting of those historical periods in the forecast model. We then consider the appropriate application of the quantitative assessment given forecasted content use, expected content investment and market trends. Content use and future revenues may differ from estimates based on changes in expectations related to market acceptance, network affiliate fee rates, advertising demand, the number of cable and satellite television subscribers receiving our networks, the number of subscribers to our streaming services, and program usage. Accordingly, we review our estimates and planned usage at least quarterly and revise our assumptions if necessary.\nConsolidation\nWe have ownership and other interests in and contractual arrangements with various entities, including corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. For each such entity, we evaluate our ownership, other interests and contractual arrangements to determine whether we should consolidate the entity or account for its interest as an investment at inception and upon reconsideration events. As part of its evaluation, we initially determine whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”). Management evaluates key considerations through a qualitative and quantitative analysis in determining whether an entity is a VIE including whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties, (ii) the ability or inability to make significant decisions about the entity’s operations, and (iii) the proportionality of voting rights of investors relative to their obligations to absorb the expected losses (or receive the expected returns) of the entity. If the entity is a VIE and if we have a variable interest in the entity, we use judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary and are thus required to consolidate the entity. In making this determination, we evaluate whether we or another party involved with the VIE (1) has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE.\nIf it is concluded that an entity is not a VIE, we consider our proportional voting interests in the entity and consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained. A controlling financial interest is determined by majority ownership and the absence of substantive third-party participation rights. Key factors we consider in determining the presence of substantive third-party participation rights include, but are not limited to, control of the board of directors, budget approval or veto rights, or operational rights that significantly impact the economic performance of the business such as programming, creative development, marketing, and selection of key personnel. Ownership interests in unconsolidated entities for which we have significant influence are accounted for as equity method.\nWe evaluated reconsideration events during the year ended December 31, 2024 and concluded there were no changes to our consolidation assessments.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs described in Note 2, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services or goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services or goods. Significant estimates and judgments are applied in determining the timing of revenue recognition for certain types of transactions, such as bundled arrangements for advertising sales and content licensing arrangements.\n52\nA substantial portion of the advertising contracts in the U.S. and certain international markets guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience level that either the program in which their advertisements are aired or the advertisement will reach. These advertising campaigns are considered to represent a single, distinct performance obligation. For such contracts, judgment is required in measuring progress across our single performance obligation. Various factors such as pricing specific to the channel, daypart and targeted demographic, as well as audience guarantees, are considered in determining how to appropriately measure progress across the campaigns. Revenues are ultimately recognized based on the guaranteed audience level delivered multiplied by the average price per impression.\nOur content licensing arrangements often include fixed license fees from the licensing of feature films and television programs in the off-network cable, premium pay, syndication, streaming, and international television and streaming markets. For arrangements that include multiple titles and/or staggered availabilities across geographical regions, the availability of each title and/or each region is considered a separate performance obligation, and the fixed fee is allocated to each title/region based on comparable market rates and recognized as revenue when the title is available for use by the licensee.\nSee",
    "item1a": "Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for details on significant risks that could impact our ability to successfully grow our cash flows. For an in-depth discussion of each of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies and further information regarding estimates and assumptions involved in their application, see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nOur financial position, earnings, and cash flows are exposed to market risks and can be affected by, among other things, economic conditions, interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of investments. We have established policies, procedures, and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our actual and potential borrowing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we entered into a new $6.0 billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement, replacing the existing $6.0 billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement. We had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024. We also have access to a commercial paper program, which had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based on a floating rate based on the applicable currency of the borrowing plus a margin. The revolving credit facility matures in October 2029, with the option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods. As of December 31, 2024, we had $39.5 billion of fixed-rate senior notes, at par value.\nOur current objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rates on earnings and cash flows. To achieve these objectives, we may enter into derivative instruments, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to benchmark interest rates in order to reduce the amount of interest paid, or to limit the impact of volatility in interest rates on future issuances of fixed rate debt. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nAs of December 31, 2024, the fair value of our outstanding senior notes, including accrued interest, was $34.9 billion. The fair value of our long-term debt may vary as a result of market conditions and other factors. A change in market interest rates will impact the fair market value of our fixed rate debt. The potential change in fair value of these senior notes from a 100 basis-point increase in quoted interest rates across all maturities, often referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve, would be a decrease in fair value of approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows, and future earnings. We operate from hubs in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia, with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. To the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, drawdowns in the appropriate local currency are available from intercompany borrowings or from our revolving credit facility. The earnings of certain international operations are expected to be reinvested in those businesses indefinitely.\n53\nThe functional currency of most of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies (“non-functional currency risk”). Such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements, content arrangements, equipment and other vendor purchases, and intercompany transactions. Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon period-end exchange rates. We also record realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, we will experience fluctuations in our revenues and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency, against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity. Any increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a negative impact on our net loss, other comprehensive loss, and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of changes in foreign currency.\nThe majority of our foreign currency exposure is tied to Europe and Latin America. We may enter into derivative instruments that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to hedge certain exposures associated with affiliate revenue, the cost of producing or acquiring content, certain intercompany transactions, or in connection with forecasted business combinations. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows. Most of our non-functional currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and capital expenditures were not hedged as of December 31, 2024. We generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur non-cash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S. dollars. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nDerivatives\nWe may use derivative financial instruments to modify our exposure to exogenous events and market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not use derivatives unless there is an underlying exposure. While derivatives are used to mitigate cash flow risk and the risk of declines in fair value, they also limit potential economic benefits to our business in the event of positive shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\nMarket Values of Investments and Liabilities \nIn addition to derivatives, we had investments in entities accounted for as equity method investments, equity investments, and other highly liquid instruments, such as money market funds and mutual funds, that are accounted for at fair value.\n \nWe also have liabilities, such as deferred compensation, that are accounted for at fair value (See Note 10 and Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Investments in mutual funds include both fixed- and floating-rate interest earning securities that carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed-rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates, while floating-rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our income from such investments may decrease in the future. Liabilities carried at fair value, such as deferred compensation, may experience capital gains that result in increased liabilities and expenses as the capital gains occur. We may enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk of these market value changes. (See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)\n54\nITEM 8.

Discovery, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the framework set forth in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”\n56\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and its subsidiaries\n \n(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,\n \nand the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive (loss) income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 appearing under Item 15(a)(2)\n \n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).\n \nWe also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024\n \nand 2023\n, \nand the results of its\n \noperations and its\n \ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024\n \nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n57\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInterim and Annual Goodwill Impairment Assessments – Networks and DTC Reporting Units\nAs described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $25.7 billion as of December 31, 2024, and the goodwill associated with the Networks and DTC reporting units was $8.4 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. Management evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or if an event or other circumstance indicates that it may not recover the carrying value of the asset. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill recorded for that reporting unit. During the second quarter of 2024, management concluded that the delta between market capitalization and book value, continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market, and uncertainty related to affiliate and sports rights renewals, including the NBA, represented a triggering event for the Networks reporting unit. The carrying value of the Networks reporting unit exceeded its fair value and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $9.1 billion. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow method. Significant judgments and assumptions for the quantitative goodwill assessments performed include discount rates, control premiums, terminal growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including the revenue projections and profit margins.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the interim and annual goodwill impairment assessments of the Networks reporting unit and the annual goodwill impairment assessment of the DTC reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Networks and DTC reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue projections for both the Networks and DTC reporting units, as well as discount rates for the Networks reporting unit; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Networks and DTC reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates of the Networks and DTC reporting units, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue projections for both the Networks and DTC reporting units, as well as discount rates for the Networks reporting unit. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue projections involved evaluating whether the assumptions were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Networks and DTC reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumptions.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n \nWashington, District of Columbia\nFebruary 27, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\n58\nWARNER BROS.

DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1. \nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nDescription of Business\nWarner Bros. Discovery is a leading global media and entertainment company that creates and distributes a differentiated and comprehensive portfolio of content and products across television, film, streaming, interactive gaming, publishing, themed experiences, and consumer products through brands including: Discovery Channel, Max, CNN, DC Studios, TNT Sports, HBO, Food Network, TLC, TBS, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, Warner Bros. Television Group, Warner Bros. Games, Adult Swim, Turner Classic Movies, and others.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we classified our operations in \nthree\n reportable segments: \n•\nStudios\n - Our Studios segment primarily consists of the production and release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, production and initial licensing of television programs to our networks/DTC services as well as third parties, distribution of our films and television programs to various third party and internal television and streaming services, distribution through the home entertainment market (physical and digital), related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming.\n•\nNetworks\n - Our Networks segment primarily consists of our domestic and international television networks.\n•\nDTC \n- Our DTC segment primarily consists of our premium pay-TV and streaming services.\nIn December 2024, the Company announced that its board of directors had authorized the Company to implement a new corporate structure. There were no changes to the Company’s reportable segments as a result of this announcement. \nMerger with the WarnerMedia Business of AT&T\nOn April 8, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), Discovery, Inc. (“Discovery”) completed its merger (the “Merger”) with the WarnerMedia business (the “WarnerMedia Business”, “WM Business” or “WM”) of AT&T, Inc. (“AT&T”) and changed its name to Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. On April 11, 2022, the Company’s shares started trading on Nasdaq under the trading symbol WBD.\nThe Merger was executed through a Reverse Morris Trust type transaction, under which WM was distributed to AT&T’s shareholders via a pro rata distribution, and immediately thereafter, combined with Discovery. (See Note 3 and Note 4). Prior to the Merger, WMH distributed $\n40.5\n billion to AT&T (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WM’s retention of certain debt. Discovery transferred purchase consideration of $\n42.4\n billion in equity to AT&T shareholders in the Merger. In August 2022, the Company and AT&T finalized the post-closing working capital settlement process, which resulted in the Company receiving a $\n1.2\n billion payment from AT&T in the third quarter of 2022 in lieu of adjusting the equity issued as purchase consideration in the Merger. AT&T shareholders received shares of WBD Series A common stock (“WBD common stock”) in the Merger representing \n71\n% of the combined Company and the Company’s pre-Merger shareholders continued to own \n29\n% of the combined Company, in each case on a fully diluted basis.\nDiscovery was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of the WM Business for accounting purposes under U.S. GAAP; therefore, Discovery is considered the Company’s predecessor and the historical financial statements of Discovery prior to April 8, 2022, are reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the Company’s historical financial statements. Accordingly, the financial results of the Company as of and for any periods prior to April 8, 2022 do not include the financial results of the WM Business and current and future results will not be comparable to results prior to the Merger.\nLabor Disruption\nThe WGA and SAG-AFTRA went on strike in May and July 2023, respectively, following the expiration of their respective collective bargaining agreements with the AMPTP. The WGA strike ended on September 27, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on October 9, 2023. The SAG-AFTRA strike ended on November 9, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on December 5, 2023. As a result of the strikes, we paused certain theatrical and television productions, which resulted in delayed production spending amongst other impacts.\nThe strikes had a material impact on the operations and results of the Company in 2023. This included a positive impact on cash flow from operations attributed to delayed production spend, and a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to timing and performance of the 2023 film slate, as well as the Company’s ability to produce, license, and deliver content. The Company experienced content completion and delivery delays in the first quarter of 2024 due to the pause in television and theatrical productions in 2023, but did not experience any material impacts for the remainder of 2024.\n64\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained, including variable interest entities (“VIE”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. For each non-wholly owned subsidiary, the Company evaluates its ownership and other interests to determine whether it should consolidate the entity or account for its ownership interest as an unconsolidated investment. As part of its evaluation, the Company makes judgments in determining whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and is thus required to consolidate the entity. (See Note 10.) If it is concluded that an entity is not a VIE, then the Company considers its proportional voting interests in the entity. The Company consolidates majority-owned subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained. A controlling financial interest is determined by majority ownership and the absence of significant third-party participating rights. Ownership interests in entities for which the Company has significant influence that are not consolidated are accounted for as equity method investments.\nIntercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nSignificant estimates and judgments inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include accounting for asset impairments, revenue recognition, estimated credit losses, content rights, leases, depreciation and amortization, the determination of ultimate revenues as they relate to amortization of capitalized content rights and accruals of participations and residuals, business combinations, share-based compensation, income taxes, other financial instruments, contingencies, estimated defined benefit plan liabilities, and the determination of whether the Company should consolidate certain entities.\nNOTE 2. \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nForeign Currency\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Financial statements of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates for revenues and expenses for the respective periods. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Cash flows from the Company’s operations in foreign countries are generally translated at the weighted average rate for the respective periods.\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that it enters into transactions denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies. Transactions denominated in currencies other than subsidiaries’ functional currencies are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Such transactions include affiliate and ad sales arrangements, content licensing arrangements, equipment and other vendor purchases and intercompany transactions. Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses based upon period-end exchange rates. The Company also records realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency are included in other income (expense), net.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.\nReceivables\nThe Company’s accounts receivable balances and the related credit losses arise primarily from distribution, advertising and content revenue. Receivables include amounts billed and currently due from customers and are presented net of an estimate for credit losses. To assess collectability, the Company analyzes market trends, economic conditions, the aging of receivables and customer specific risks, and records a provision for estimated credit losses expected over the lifetime of receivables. The corresponding expense for the expected credit losses is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company does not require collateral with respect to trade receivables.\n65\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevolving Receivables Program\nThe Company has a revolving agreement to transfer up to $\n5,200\n million of certain receivables through its bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, Warner Bros. Discovery Receivables Funding, LLC, to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. The Company services the sold receivables for the financial institution for a fee and pays fees to the financial institution in connection with this revolving agreement. The agreement is a continuation of the agreement the WarnerMedia Business had in place prior to the Merger. This agreement is subject to renewal on an annual basis and the transfer limit may be expanded or reduced from time to time. As customers pay their balances, the Company’s available capacity under this revolving agreement increases and typically the Company transfers additional receivables into the program. \nThe gross value of the proceeds received results in derecognition of receivables and the obligations assumed are recorded at fair value. Cash received is reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The obligations assumed when proceeds are received relate to expected credit losses on sold receivables and estimated fee payments made on outstanding sold receivables already transferred. The obligations are subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated expected credit losses and interest rates, which are considered Level 3 fair value measurements since the inputs are unobservable (See Note 8). In some cases, the Company may have collections that have not yet been remitted to the bank, resulting in a liability. Increases to accounts payable and subsequent payments are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nThe Company has a factoring agreement to sell certain of its non-U.S. trade accounts receivable on a limited recourse basis to a third-party financial institution. The Company accounts for these transactions as sales in accordance with ASC 860, “Transfers and Servicing”, as its continuing involvement subsequent to the transfer is limited to providing certain servicing and collection actions on behalf of the purchaser of the designated trade accounts receivable. Proceeds from amounts factored are recorded as an increase to cash and cash equivalents and a reduction to receivables, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash received is also reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The accounts receivable factoring program is separate and distinct from the revolving receivables program.\nFilm and Television Content Rights\nThe Company capitalizes costs to produce television programs and feature films, including direct production costs, production overhead, interest, acquisition costs and development costs, as well as advances for live programming rights, such as sports. Costs to acquire licensed television series and feature film programming rights are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing. Production incentives received from various jurisdictions where the Company produces content are recorded as a reduction to capitalized production costs. All capitalized content and prepaid license fees are classified as noncurrent assets, with the exception of content acquired with an initial license period of 12 months or less and prepaid sports rights expected to air within 12 months.\nThe Company groups its film and television content rights by monetization strategy: content that is predominantly monetized individually and content that is predominantly monetized as a group.\nContent Monetized Individually\nFor films and television programs predominantly monetized individually, the amount of capitalized film and television production costs (net of incentives) amortized and the amount of participations and residuals to be recognized as expense in a particular period are determined using the individual film forecast method. Under this method, the amortization of capitalized costs and the accrual of participations and residuals are based on the proportion of the film’s or television program’s revenues recognized for such period to the film’s or television program’s estimated remaining ultimate revenues (i.e., the total revenue to be received throughout a film’s or television program’s remaining life cycle).\n66\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe process of estimating ultimate revenues requires us to make a series of judgments related to future revenue-generating activities associated with a particular film. Prior to the theatrical release of a film, the Company’s estimates are based on factors such as the historical performance of similar films, the star power of the lead actors, the rating and genre of the film, pre-release market research (including test market screenings), international distribution plans and the expected number of theaters in which the film will be released. Subsequent to release, ultimate revenues are updated to reflect initial performance, which is often predictive of future performance. For a film or television program that is predominantly monetized on its own but also monetized with other films and/or programs (such as on the Company’s DTC or linear services), the Company makes a reasonable estimate of the value attributable to the film or program’s exploitation while monetized with other films/programs and expenses such costs as the film or television program is exhibited. For theatrical films, the period over which ultimate revenues from all applicable sources and exhibition windows are estimated does not exceed \n10\n years from the date of the film’s initial release. For television programs, the ultimate period does not exceed \n10\n years from delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, \nfive years\n from delivery of the most recent episode, if later. For games, the ultimate period does not exceed \ntwo years\n from the date of the game’s initial release. Ultimates for produced content monetized on an individual basis are reviewed and updated (as applicable) on a quarterly basis; any adjustments are applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year of the change.\nContent Monetized as a Group\nFor programs monetized as a group, including licensed programming, the Company’s film groups are generally aligned along the Company’s networks and digital content offerings, except for certain international territories wherein content assets are grouped by genre or territory. Adjustments for projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Participations and residuals are generally expensed in line with the pattern of usage. Streaming content and premium pay-TV amortization for each period is recognized based on estimated viewing patterns as there are generally little to no direct revenues to associate to the individual content assets. As such, viewership is most representative of the use of the title. Licensed rights to film and television programming are typically amortized over the useful life of the program’s license period on a straight-line or accelerated basis. The Company allocates the cost of multi-year sports programming arrangements over the contract period to each event or season based on its projected advertising revenue and an allocation of distribution revenue (estimated relative value). If annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, the Company expenses the related contractual payments during the applicable season. Amortization of sports rights takes place when the content airs.\nQuarterly, the Company prepares analyses to support its content amortization expense. Critical assumptions used in determining content amortization for programming predominantly monetized as a group include: (i) the grouping of content with similar characteristics, (ii) the application of a quantitative revenue forecast model or historical viewership model based on the adequacy of historical data, and (iii) determining the appropriate historical periods to utilize and the relative weighting of those historical periods in the forecast model. The Company then considers the appropriate application of the quantitative assessment given forecasted content use, expected content investment and market trends. Content use and future revenues may differ from estimates based on changes in expectations related to market acceptance, network affiliate fee rates, advertising demand, the number of cable and satellite television subscribers receiving the Company’s networks, the number of subscribers to its streaming services, and program usage. Accordingly, the Company reviews its estimates and planned usage at least quarterly and revises its assumptions if necessary. Any material adjustments from the Company’s review of the amortization rates for assets in film groups are applied prospectively in the period of the change.\nUnamortized Film Costs Impairment Assessment\nUnamortized film costs are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a film (or television program) predominantly monetized on its own, or a film group, may be less than its unamortized costs. In addition, a change in the predominant monetization strategy is considered a triggering event for impairment testing before a title is accounted for as part of a film group. If the carrying value of an individual feature film or television program, or film group, exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded in the amount of the difference. For content that is predominantly monetized individually, the Company utilizes estimates including ultimate revenues and additional costs to be incurred (including exploitation and participation costs), in order to determine whether the carrying value of a film or television program is impaired.\nGame Development Costs\nGame development costs are expensed as incurred before the applicable game reaches technological feasibility, or for online hosted arrangements, before the preliminary project phase is complete and it is probable the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Commencing upon a title’s release, the capitalized game development costs are amortized based on the proportion of the game’s revenues recognized for such period to the game’s total current and anticipated revenues, or, if greater, for non-hosted games, on a straight-line basis over the title’s estimated economic life. Unamortized capitalized game production and development costs are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or net realizable value and reported in “Film and television content rights and games” on the consolidated balance sheets.\n67\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInvestments\nThe Company holds investments in equity method investees and equity investments with and without readily determinable fair values.\n (See Note 10.)\nEquity Method Investments\nInvestments in equity method investees are those for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not control and is not the primary beneficiary or the entity is not a VIE and the Company does not have a controlling financial interest. Under this method of accounting, the Company typically records its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of equity method investees in loss from equity investees, net and a corresponding increase or decrease to the investment balances. Cash payments to equity method investees such as additional investments, loans and advances and expenses incurred on behalf of investees, as well as payments from equity method investees such as dividends, distributions and repayments of loans and advances are recorded as adjustments to investment balances. \nThe Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be recoverable. (See “Asset Impairment Analysis” below.)\nEquity Investments with Readily Determinable Fair Values\nInvestments in entities or other securities in which the Company has no control or significant influence and is not the primary beneficiary, and have a readily determinable fair value are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices and are classified as equity securities or equity investments with readily determinable fair value. The investments are measured at fair value based on a quoted market price per unit in active markets multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs (Level 1). Gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net\n \non the consolidated statements of operations. (See Note 10 and Note 18.)\nEquity Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Values\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values include ownership rights that either (i) do not meet the definition of in-substance common stock or (ii) do not provide the Company with control or significant influence and these investments do not have readily determinable fair values. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes as of the date that an observable transaction takes place. Adjustments for observable price changes are recorded in other income (expense), net. \n(See Note 10 and Note 18.)\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments. Internal use software costs are capitalized during the application development stage; software costs incurred during the preliminary project and post implementation stages are expensed as incurred. Repairs and maintenance expenditures that do not enhance the use or extend the life of property and equipment are expensed as incurred. Depreciation for most property and equipment is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n (See Note 18.)\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets are included in other noncurrent assets. Finance lease ROU assets are included in property and equipment, net. Operating and finance lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption and leases with initial terms of one year or less are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.\nA rate implicit in the lease when readily determinable is used in arriving at the present value of lease payments. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide sufficient information to determine an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at lease commencement date for most of its leases. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company's U.S. dollar denominated senior unsecured borrowing curves using public credit ratings adjusted down to a collateralized basis using a combination of recovery rate and credit notching approaches and translated into major contract currencies as applicable.\n68\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. The Company does not separate lease components from non-lease components across all lease categories. Instead, each separate lease component and non-lease component are accounted for as a single lease component. In addition, variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate are included in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities at lease inception. All other variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities. Lease expense for operating leases and short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, the Company recognizes interest expense on lease liabilities using the effective interest method and amortization of ROU assets on a straight-line basis.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company participates in and/or sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan that covers certain U.S. based employees and several U.S. and non-U.S. nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that are noncontributory. Defined benefit plan obligations are based on various assumptions used by the Company’s actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, compensation rate increases, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions could affect future expenses and obligations.\nAsset Impairment Analysis\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is allocated to the Company’s reporting units, which are its operating segments or one level below its operating segments. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or earlier if an event or other circumstance indicates that it may not recover the carrying value of the asset. If the Company believes that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill recorded for that reporting unit. The Company typically performs a quantitative impairment test at least every three years, irrespective of the outcome of the Company’s qualitative assessment.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets such as amortizing trademarks and trade names; affiliate, advertising, and subscriber relationships; franchises and other intangible assets; lease ROU assets; and property and equipment are not required to be tested for impairment annually, but rather whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If an impairment analysis is required, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. \n•\nIf the intent is to hold the asset for continued use, the impairment test requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the excess of the asset group’s carrying value over its fair value, which is typically determined by discounting the future cash flows associated with that asset group. \n•\nIf the intent is to hold the asset for sale and certain other criteria are met, the impairment test involves comparing the asset’s carrying value to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference. \nSignificant judgments used for long-lived asset impairment assessments include identifying the appropriate asset groupings that represent the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent and primary assets within those groupings, determining whether events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and assumptions applied in determining fair value, which include reasonable discount rates, growth rates, market risk premiums and other assumptions about the economic environment.\nEquity Method Investments and Equity Investments Without Readily Determinable Fair Value\nEquity method investments are reviewed for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis and are written down to fair value if there is evidence of a loss in value that is other-than-temporary. The estimation of fair value and whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred requires the application of significant judgment and future results may vary from current assumptions. If declines in the value of the equity method investments are determined to be other-than-temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period as a component of loss from equity investees, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\n69\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor equity investments without readily determinable fair value, investments are recorded at cost and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes as of the date that an observable transaction takes place. The Company performs a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis to determine if any observable price changes have occurred. If the qualitative assessment indicates that an observable price change has occurred, a gain or loss is recorded equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value in the current period as a component of other income (expense), net.\n (See Note 10.)\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and from market volatility related to certain investments measured at fair value. At the inception of a derivative contract, the Company designates the derivative based on the Company’s intentions and expectations as to the likely effectiveness as a hedge (see Note 13), as follows:\n•\na hedge of a forecasted transaction or the exposure to variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow hedge”);\n•\na hedge of the foreign currency exposure from net investments in foreign operations (“net investment hedge”);\n•\na hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value hedge”); or\n•\nan instrument with no hedging designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company may designate derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate foreign currency risk arising from third-party revenue agreements, intercompany licensing agreements, production expenses and rebates, or to hedge the interest rate risk for certain senior notes and forecasted debt issuances. For instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the forward contract is recorded in other comprehensive loss and reclassified into the statements of operations in the same line item in which the hedged item is recorded and in the same period as the hedged item affects earnings.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company may designate derivative instruments as hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The Company assesses the effectiveness of net investment hedges utilizing the spot-method. The entire change in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as net investment hedges is initially recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of other comprehensive loss. While the change in fair value attributable to hedge effectiveness remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the net investment is sold or liquidated, the change in fair value attributable to components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (e.g., forward points, cross currency basis, etc.) is reflected as a component of interest expense, net in the current period.\n Fair Value Hedges\nThe Company may designate derivative instruments as fair value hedges to mitigate the variability in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment. For those derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments, including offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged items are recorded in the statements of operations in the same line item where the hedged risk occurs.\nNo Hedging Designation\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges. These instruments are intended to mitigate economic exposures due to exogenous events and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and from market volatility related to certain investments measured at fair value. The changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in the statements of operations in the same line item where the hedged risk occurs.\nFinancial Statement Presentation\nUnsettled derivative contracts are recorded at their gross fair values on the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the fair value that represents cash flows occurring within one year is classified as current, and the portion related to cash flows occurring beyond one year is classified as noncurrent.\nCash flows from designated derivative instruments used as hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the cash flows of the hedged item. Cash flows from periodic settlement of interest on cross currency swaps and derivative contracts not designated as hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n70\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTreasury Stock\nWhen stock is acquired for purposes other than formal or constructive retirement, the purchase price of the acquired stock is recorded in a separate treasury stock account, which is separately reported as a reduction of equity. Treasury stock held by Discovery prior to the Merger was not retired. \nWhen stock is retired or purchased for formal or constructive retirement, the purchase price is initially recorded as a reduction to the par value of the shares repurchased, with any excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital related to the series of shares repurchased and any remaining excess purchase price recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. If the purchase price exceeds the amounts allocated to par value and additional paid-in capital related to the series of shares repurchased and retained earnings, the remainder is allocated to additional paid-in capital related to other series of shares.\nTo determine the cost of treasury stock that is either sold or reissued, the Company uses the last in, first out method. If the proceeds from the re-issuance of treasury stock are greater than the cost, the excess is recorded as additional paid-in capital. If the proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock are less than the cost, the excess cost first reduces any additional paid-in capital arising from previous treasury stock transactions for that class of stock, and any additional excess is recorded as a reduction of retained earnings.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services or goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services or goods. Revenues do not include taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities such as sales tax and value-added tax. However, certain revenues include taxes that customers pay to taxing authorities on the Company’s behalf, such as foreign withholding tax. Revenue recognition for each source of revenue is also based on the following policies.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of commercial time on linear (television networks and authenticated TVE applications) and digital platforms (DTC subscription services and websites). A substantial portion of the linear and digital advertising contracts in the U.S. and certain international markets guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience level that either the program in which their advertisements are aired or the advertisement will reach. On the linear platform, the Company provides a service to deliver an advertising campaign which is satisfied by the provision of a minimum number of advertising spots in exchange for a fixed fee over a contract period of one year or less. The Company delivers spots in accordance with these contracts during a variety of day parts and programs. In the agreements governing these advertising campaigns, the Company has also promised to deliver to its customers a guaranteed minimum number of viewers (“impressions”) on a specific television network within a particular demographic (e.g. men aged 18-35). These advertising campaigns are considered to represent a single, distinct performance obligation. Revenues are recognized based on the guaranteed audience level multiplied by the average price per impression. The Company provides the advertiser with advertising until the guaranteed audience level is delivered, and invoiced advertising revenue receivables may exceed the value of the audience delivery. As such, revenues are deferred until the guaranteed audience level is delivered or the rights associated with the guarantee lapse, which is typically less than one year. Audience guarantees are initially developed internally, based on planned programming, historical audience levels, the success of pilot programs, and market trends. Actual audience and delivery information is published by independent ratings services.\nDigital advertising contracts typically contain promises to deliver guaranteed impressions in specific markets against a targeted demographic during a stipulated period of time. If the specified number of impressions is not delivered, the transaction price is reduced by the number of impressions not delivered multiplied by the contractually stated price per impression. Each promise is considered a separate performance obligation. For digital contracts with an audience guarantee, advertising revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered. Actual audience delivery is typically reported by independent third parties.\nFor contracts without an audience guarantee, advertising revenues are recognized as each spot airs. The airing of individual spots without a guaranteed audience level are each distinct, individual performance obligations. The Company allocates the consideration to each spot based on its relative standalone selling price.\n71\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDistribution\nDistribution revenues are generated from fees charged to network distributors, which include cable, direct-to-home (“DTH”) satellite, telecommunications and digital service providers, and DTC subscribers. Cable operators, DTH satellite operators and telecommunications service providers typically pay royalties via a per-subscriber fee for the right to distribute the Company’s programming under the terms of distribution contracts. The majority of the Company’s distribution fees are collected monthly throughout the year and distribution revenue is recognized over the term of the contracts based on contracted programming rates and reported subscriber levels. The amount of distribution fees due to the Company is reported by distributors based on actual subscriber levels. Such information is generally not received until after the close of the reporting period. In these cases, the Company estimates the number of subscribers receiving the Company’s programming to estimate royalty revenue. Historical adjustments to recorded estimates have not been material. Distribution revenue from fixed-fee contracts is recognized over the contract term based on the continuous delivery of the content to the affiliate. Any monetary incentives provided to distributors other than for distinct goods or services acquired at fair value are recognized as a reduction of revenue over the term.\nAlthough the delivery of linear feeds and digital products, such as video-on-demand (“VOD”) and authenticated TVE applications, are considered distinct performance obligations within a distribution arrangement, on-demand offerings generally match the programs that are airing on the linear network. Therefore, the Company recognizes revenue for licensing arrangements as the license fee is earned and based on continuous delivery for fixed fee contracts.\nRevenues associated with digital distribution arrangements are recognized when the Company transfers control of the programming and the rights to distribute the programming to the customer.\nFor DTC subscription services, the Company recognizes revenue as the service fee is earned over the subscription period.\nWhen linear and DTC distribution arrangements are offered in a bundle deal, consideration is allocated to each deliverable based on its relative standalone selling price, and revenue is recognized as described above.\nContent\nContent revenues are generated from the release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, production of programs licensed for initial television/SVOD exhibition, the additional licensing of feature films and television programs to various television, SVOD and other digital markets, distribution of feature films and television programs in the physical and digital home entertainment market, sales of console games and mobile in-game content, sublicensing of sports rights, and licensing of intellectual property such as characters and brands.\nIn general, fixed payments for the licensing of intellectual property are recognized as revenue at either the inception of the license term or as sales-based royalties as underlying sales occur if the intellectual property has significant standalone functionality (“functional IP,” such as a produced film or television series), or over the corresponding license term if the licensee’s ability to derive utility is dependent upon our continued support of the intellectual property throughout the license term (“symbolic IP,” such as a character or a brand). Feature films may be produced or acquired for initial exhibition in theaters or direct release on our streaming service. Arrangements with theaters for exhibiting a film over a certain period are generally sales-based royalties and recorded as revenue as the underlying sales of the exhibitors occur. \nTelevision programs are initially produced for broadcast networks, cable networks, premium pay services, first-run syndication or streaming services; revenues are recognized when the programs are available for use by the licensee. Fixed license fee revenues from the subsequent licensing of feature films and television programs in the off-network cable, premium pay, syndication, streaming and international television and streaming markets are also recognized upon availability of the content for use by the licensee. For television/streaming service licenses that include multiple titles with a fixed license fee across all titles, the availability of each title is considered a separate performance obligation, and the fixed fee is allocated to each title based on its estimated relative standalone selling price and recognized as revenue when the title is available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, revenues are recognized when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension. Certain arrangements (e.g., certain pay-TV/SVOD licenses) may include variable license fees that are based on sales of the licensee; these are recognized as revenue as the applicable underlying sales occur. \nRevenues from home entertainment sales of feature films and television programs in physical format are generally recognized at the later of the delivery date or the date when made widely available for sale or rental by retailers (“street date”) based on gross sales less a provision for estimated returns, rebates and pricing allowances. The provision is based on management’s estimates by analyzing vendor sales of our product, historical return trends, current economic conditions and changes in customer demand. Revenues from the licensing of television programs and films for electronic sell-through or video-on-demand are recognized when the product has been purchased by and made available to the consumer to either download or stream.\n72\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenues from sales of console games generally follow the same recognition methods as film and television programs in the home entertainment market. Revenues from digital sales of in-game purchases are assessed for deferral based on type of digital item purchased (e.g., consumable vs. durable) and estimated life of consumer game play and recognized upon purchase or\nover time as applicable.\nRevenues from the licensing of intellectual property such as characters or brands (e.g., for merchandising or theme parks) are\nrecognized either straight-line over the license term or as the licensee’s underlying product sales occur (sales-based royalty) depending on which method is most reflective of the earnings process.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nA contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of the Company’s right to bill and receive consideration and that right is conditioned upon something other than the passage of time. A contract liability, such as deferred revenue, is recorded when the Company has recorded billings in conjunction with its contractual right or when cash is received in advance of the Company’s performance.\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of TV/SVOD content licensing arrangements where the content has not yet been made available to the customer, consumer products and themed experience licensing arrangements with fixed payments, advance payment for DTC subscriptions, cash billed/received for television advertising in advance or for which the guaranteed viewership has not been provided, and advance fees related to the sublicensing of Olympic rights. The amounts classified as current are expected to be earned within the next year.\nPayment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, the Company requires payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company has incentive plans under which performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”), service-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and stock options may be issued. In addition, the Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). Share-based compensation expense for all awards is recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense. Forfeitures for all awards are recognized as incurred. Excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options and vested RSUs, PRSUs and the ESPP are reported as cash inflows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nPRSUs\nPRSUs represent the contingent right to receive shares of WBD common stock, and typically vest over \none\n to \nthree years\n based on continuous service and the attainment of qualitative and quantitative performance targets. The number of PRSUs that vest typically ranges from \n0\n% to \n300\n% based on a sliding scale where achieving or exceeding the performance target will result in \n100\n% to \n300\n% of the PRSUs vesting and achieving \n70\n% or less of the target will result in \nno\n portion of the PRSUs vesting. Additionally, for certain PRSUs, the Company’s Compensation Committee has discretion in determining the final number of units that vest, but may not increase the amount of any PRSU award above \n100\n%. Upon vesting, each PRSU becomes convertible into one share of WBD common stock. Holders of PRSUs do not receive payments of dividends in the event the Company pays a cash dividend until such PRSUs are converted into shares of WBD common stock.\nCompensation expense for PRSUs is based on the fair value of WBD common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense for PRSUs that vest based on achieving subjective operating performance conditions or in situations where the employee may withhold taxes in excess of the maximum statutory requirement, is remeasured at fair value each reporting period until the award is settled. Compensation expense for all PRSUs is recognized ratably over the vesting period only when it is probable that the operating performance conditions will be achieved. The Company records a cumulative adjustment to compensation expense for PRSUs if there is a change in the determination of the probability that the operating performance conditions will be achieved.\nRSUs\nRSUs represent the contingent right to receive shares of WBD common stock, substantially all of which vest ratably each year over periods of \nthree\n to \nfive years\n based on continuous service. Compensation expense for RSUs is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and is recognized ratably during the vesting period. RSU awards generally provide for accelerated vesting upon termination from the Company if the employee has reached a specified age and years of service and if the grant has been held at least \nsix months\n from the grant date.\n73\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nStock Options\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to or in excess of the closing market price of WBD common stock on the date of grant and vest ratably over \nthree\n or \nfour years\n from the grant date based on continuous service and expire \nseven years\n from the date of grant. Compensation expense for stock options is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and is recognized ratably during the vesting period. Stock options generally provide for accelerated vesting upon termination from the Company if the employee has reached a specified age and years of service and if the grant has been held at least \nsix months\n from the grant date.\nThe fair values of stock options are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Because the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of awards. For stock options the simplified method is utilized to calculate the expected term, since the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The simplified method considers the period from the date of grant through the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the award. Expected volatility is based on a combination of implied volatilities from traded options on WBD common stock and historical realized volatility of WBD and peer group common stock. The dividend yield is assumed to be \nzero\n because the Company has no history of paying cash dividends and no present intention to pay dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the award.\nESPP\nThe ESPP enables eligible employees to purchase shares of WBD common stock through payroll deductions or other permitted means. The Company recognizes the fair value of the discount associated with shares purchased under the ESPP as share-based compensation expense.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and are presented in selling, general and administrative expenses.\n Third-party advertising costs were $\n2,152\n million, $\n2,428\n million and $\n2,519\n million for years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCollaborative Arrangements\nThe Company’s collaborative arrangements primarily relate to arrangements entered into with third parties to jointly finance and distribute certain theatrical and television productions, arrangements entered into with third parties to bundle streaming services, and an arrangement entered into with CBS Broadcasting, Inc. (“CBS”) surrounding The National Collegiate Athletic Association (the “NCAA”).\nCo-financing arrangements generally represent the assignment of an economic interest in a film or television series to a producing partner. The Company generally records the amounts received for the assignment of an interest as a reduction of production cost, as the partner assumes the risk for their share of the film or series asset. The substance of these arrangements is that the third-party partner owns an interest in the film or series; therefore, in each period, based on the terms of the arrangement, the Company reflects the estimate of the third-party partner’s interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film or series, using the individual film forecast method, in cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. On occasion, the Company acquires the economic interest in a film from a producing partner; in this case, the Company capitalizes the acquisition cost as a content asset in film and television content rights and games and accounts for the third-party partner’s share in applicable distribution results as described above.\nBundled streaming service arrangements are evaluated at inception to determine whether it is a collaborative agreement based on the facts and circumstances. In the cases of bundled collaborative agreements, the partners share the expenses incurred and revenues generated. In each period, the Company reflects its share of expenses and revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe arrangement among Turner, CBS and the NCAA provides Turner and CBS with rights to the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship Tournament (the “NCAA Tournament”) in the U.S. and its territories and possessions through 2032. The aggregate programming rights fee, production costs, advertising revenues and sponsorship revenues related to the NCAA Tournament and related programming are shared equally by the Company and CBS. However, if the amount paid for the programming rights fee and production costs in any given year exceeds advertising and sponsorship revenues for that year, CBS’ share of such shortfall is limited to specified annual caps. The amounts recorded pursuant to the loss cap were not material during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \nIn accounting for this arrangement, the Company records advertising revenue for the advertisements aired on its networks and amortizes its share of the programming rights fee based on the estimated relative value of each season over the term of the arrangement.\n74\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor our collaborative arrangements entered into with third parties to jointly finance and distribute certain theatrical and television productions, net participation costs of\n \n$\n632\n million and\n \n$\n393\n million\n \nwere recorded in cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred taxes are measured using rates the Company expects to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized.\nFrom time to time, the Company engages in transactions in which the tax consequences may be uncertain. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. The Company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations. In the normal course of business, the Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities.\nIn determining the Company’s tax provision for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits unless the Company determines that such positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits, including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes. The Company includes interest and where appropriate, penalties, as a component of income tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Significant judgment is exercised in evaluating all relevant information, the technical merits of the tax positions, and the accurate measurement of unrecognized tax benefits when determining the amount of reserve and whether positions taken on the Company’s tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained. This also involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the potential outcome of positions taken on tax returns that may be reviewed by tax authorities. The Company adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company entered into a tax matters agreement (“TMA”) with AT&T. Pursuant to the TMA, the Company is responsible for tax liabilities of the WM Business related to the periods prior to AT&T’s ownership of the WM Business (June 14, 2018), and AT&T is responsible for tax liabilities of the WM Business related to the period for which they owned the WM Business (June 15, 2018 through April 8, 2022). With respect to unrecognized tax benefits related to jurisdictions that have joint and several liability among members of the AT&T tax filing group during the AT&T ownership period, the Company has not recorded any liabilities\n \nfor unrecognized tax benefits or indemnification receivables related to matters that were attributable to jurisdictions that have joint and several liability among members of the AT&T filing group since AT&T was determined to be the primary obligor.\nConcentrations Risk\nCustomers\nNo individual customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated revenues for 2024, 2023 or 2022. The Company had one customer that represented more than 10% of distribution revenue in 2024, which totaled \n13\n%. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s trade receivables do not represent a significant concentration of credit risk as the customers and markets in which the Company operates are varied and dispersed across many geographic areas.\nFinancial Institutions\nCash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. The Company has deposits held with banks that exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nThe Company is exposed to the risk that the counterparties to outstanding derivative financial instruments will default on their obligations. The Company manages these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with outstanding derivative financial instruments is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions. The Company also has a limited number of arrangements where collateral is required to be posted in the instance that certain fair value thresholds are exceeded.\n Additionally, the Company may be required to post collateral related to its revolving receivables program. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had posted $\n105\n million of collateral under these arrangements.\n75\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAccounting and Reporting Pronouncements Adopted\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance updating the disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2024 and has provided the required annual disclosures in Note 23.\nAccounting and Reporting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance updating the disclosure requirements for income taxes, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. The Company did not early adopt the amendments as of December 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and will update its tax disclosures upon adoption.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance updating the disclosure requirements for income statement expenses, primarily through disaggregation of certain types of expenses presented on the income statement. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied either: (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date, or (2) retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its disclosures.\nNOTE 3. \nEQUITY AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\nCommon Stock Issued in Connection with the WarnerMedia Merger\nIn connection with the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of Discovery Series A common stock, Discovery Series B convertible common stock, and Discovery Series C common stock, was reclassified and automatically converted into \none\n share of WBD common stock, and each issued and outstanding share of Discovery Series A-1 convertible preferred stock (“Series A-1 Preferred Stock”) and Series C-1 convertible preferred stock was reclassified and automatically converted into \n13.1135\n and \n19.3648\n shares of WBD common stock, respectively.\nThe Merger required the consent of Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership under Discovery’s certificate of incorporation as the sole holder of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock. In connection with Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership’s entry into the consent agreement and related forfeiture of the significant rights attached to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in the reclassification of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into common stock, it received an increase to the number of shares of common stock of the Company into which the Series A-1 Preferred Stock converted. The impact of the issuance of such additional shares of common stock was $\n789\n million and was recorded as a transaction expense in selling, general and administrative expense upon the closing of the Merger in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOn April 8, 2022, the Company issued \n1.7\n billion shares of WBD common stock as consideration paid for the acquisition of WM. (See Note 4).\nRepurchase Programs\nCommon Stock\nUnder the Company’s stock repurchase program, management is authorized to purchase shares of WBD common stock from time to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices, pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase agreements, or other derivative arrangements as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to stock price, business and market conditions and other factors.\n76\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn February 2020, the Company’s board of directors authorized additional stock repurchases of up to $\n2\n billion upon completion of its existing $\n1\n billion repurchase authorization announced in May 2019. All common stock repurchases, including prepaid common stock repurchase contracts, have been made through open market transactions and have been recorded as treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did \nno\nt repurchase any of its common stock. Over the life of the Company’s repurchase programs and prior to the Merger and conversion of Discovery common stock to WBD common stock, the Company had repurchased \n3\n million and \n229\n million shares of Discovery Series A and Discovery Series C common stock, respectively, for the aggregate purchase price of $\n171\n million and $\n8.2\n billion, respectively.\nEarnings Per Share\nAll share and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification and automatic conversion into WBD common stock, except for Series A-1 Preferred Stock, which has not been recast because the conversion of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into WBD common stock in connection with the Merger was considered a discrete event and treated prospectively.\nThe table below sets forth the Company’s calculated earnings per share (in millions).

The Merger was executed through a Reverse Morris Trust type transaction, under which WM was distributed to AT&T’s shareholders via a pro-rata distribution, and immediately thereafter, combined with Discovery. Discovery was deemed to be the accounting acquirer of WM.\nThe Merger combined WM’s content library and valuable intellectual property with Discovery’s global footprint, collection of local-language content and deep regional expertise across more than \n220\n countries and territories. The Company expects this broad, worldwide portfolio of brands, coupled with its DTC potential and the attractiveness of the combined assets, to result in increased market penetration globally. The Merger is also expected to create significant cost synergies for the Company.\n77\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPurchase Price\nThe following table summarizes the components of the aggregate purchase consideration paid to acquire WM (in millions). \nFair value of WBD common stock issued to AT&T shareholders \n(1)\n$\n42,309\n \nEstimated fair value of share-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services \n(2)\n94\n \nSettlement of preexisting relationships \n(3)\n(\n27\n)\nPurchase consideration \n$\n42,376\n \n(1)\n \nThe fair value of WBD common stock issued to AT&T shareholders represents approximately \n1,732\n million shares of WBD common stock multiplied by the closing share price for Discovery Series A common stock of $\n24.43\n on Nasdaq on the Closing Date. The number of shares of WBD common stock issued in the Merger was determined based on the number of fully diluted shares of Discovery, Inc. common stock immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, multiplied by the quotient of \n71\n%/\n29\n%.\n(2)\n \nThis amount represents the value of AT&T restricted stock unit awards that were not vested and were replaced by WBD restricted stock unit awards with similar terms and conditions as the original AT&T awards. The conversion was based on the ratio of the volume-weighted average per share closing price of AT&T common stock on the \nten\n trading days prior to the Closing Date and the volume-weighted average per share closing price of WBD common stock on the \nten\n trading days following the Closing Date. The fair value of replacement equity-based awards attributable to pre-Merger service was recorded as part of the consideration transferred in the Merger. See Note 15 for additional information.\n(3)\n \nThe amount represents the effective settlement of outstanding payables and receivables between the Company and WM. \nNo\n gain or loss was recognized upon settlement as amounts were determined to be reflective of fair market value.\nBalances reflect rounding of dollar and share amounts to millions, which may result in differences for recalculated standalone amounts compared with the amounts presented above. In August 2022, the Company and AT&T finalized the post-closing working capital settlement process, which resulted in the Company receiving a $\n1.2\n billion payment from AT&T in the third quarter of 2022. AT&T has raised certain claims associated with the Merger that the Company believes are without merit. In connection with the dispute, the Company established an immaterial accrual in the first quarter of 2024.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe Company applied the acquisition method of accounting to WM, whereby the excess of the fair value of the purchase price paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill reflects the assembled workforce of WM as well as revenue enhancements, cost savings and operating synergies that are expected to result from the Merger. The goodwill recorded as part of the Merger was allocated to the Studios, Networks and DTC reportable segments in the amounts of $\n9,308\n million, $\n7,074\n million and $\n5,727\n million, respectively, and is not deductible for tax purposes.\nDuring 2023, the Company finalized the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments were reflected in the period in which the adjustments occurred. Adjustments recorded in 2023 were $\n368\n million, primarily related to taxes, and were recorded in other noncurrent assets, deferred income taxes, and other noncurrent liabilities, with an offset to goodwill. \nThe allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, measurement period adjustments, and a reconciliation to total consideration transferred is presented in the table below (in millions).\nPreliminary\n April 8, 2022\nMeasurement Period\nAdjustments\nFinal\n April 8, 2022\nCash\n$\n2,419\n \n$\n(\n10\n)\n$\n2,409\n \nAccounts receivable\n4,224\n \n(\n60\n)\n4,164\n \nOther current assets\n4,619\n \n(\n133\n)\n4,486\n \nFilm and television content rights and games\n28,729\n \n(\n344\n)\n28,385\n \nProperty and equipment\n4,260\n \n13\n \n4,273\n \nGoodwill\n21,513\n \n596\n \n22,109\n \nIntangible assets\n44,889\n \n100\n \n44,989\n \nOther noncurrent assets\n5,206\n \n283\n \n5,489\n \nCurrent liabilities \n(\n10,544\n)\n12\n \n(\n10,532\n)\nDebt assumed\n(\n41,671\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n41,680\n)\nDeferred income taxes\n(\n13,264\n)\n492\n \n(\n12,772\n)\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n(\n8,004\n)\n(\n940\n)\n(\n8,944\n)\nTotal consideration paid\n$\n42,376\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n42,376\n \n78\nWARNER BROS.

These costs were associated with legal and professional services and integration activities and were recognized as operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, the expense related to the issuance of additional shares of common stock in connection with the conversion of Advance/Newhouse Programming’s Series A-1 Preferred Stock was $\n789\n million and was recorded as a transaction expense in selling, general and administrative expense upon the closing of the Merger. (See Note 3.)\nAs a result of the Merger, WM’s assets, liabilities, and operations were included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the Closing Date. \nThe following table presents WM revenue and earnings as reported within the consolidated financial statements (in millions).\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nRevenues:\nAdvertising\n$\n2,849\n \nDistribution\n10,980\n \nContent \n10,001\n \nOther\n720\n \nTotal revenues\n24,550\n \nInter-segment eliminations\n(\n2,225\n)\nNet revenues\n$\n22,325\n \nNet loss available to Warner Bros.

For assets whose economic benefits are anticipated to be consumed evenly, a straight-line method is utilized. For assets in which the economic benefits are expected to be recognized unevenly over the useful life of the asset, an accelerated method such as the sum-of-the-months’ digits method is utilized. Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was $\n5,935\n million, $\n6,854\n million and $\n6,237\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring 2024, as a result of the goodwill impairment charge discussed below and recorded in the second quarter of 2024, and the long-term trends and risks associated with the Company’s Networks reporting unit, the Company reassessed and shortened the useful lives for certain of its linear networks trade names. This change was considered a change in estimate, was accounted for prospectively, and resulted in incremental amortization expense of $\n184\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nDuring 2023, the Company reassessed the useful lives and amortization methods for its linear networks and HBO trademarks and trade names, and its DC franchise, and concluded the pattern of amortization should be accelerated. Accordingly, the Company has changed the amortization method for these assets from the straight-line method to the sum-of-the-months’ digits method. This change was considered a change in estimate, was accounted for prospectively, and resulted in incremental amortization expense of $\n368\n million\n \nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAmortization expense relating to intangible assets subject to amortization for each of the next five years and thereafter is estimated to be as follows (in millions).\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nAmortization expense\n$\n4,578\n \n$\n3,423\n \n$\n2,636\n \n$\n2,013\n \n$\n1,768\n \n$\n17,881\n \nImpairment Analysis\nWe perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis, and between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.\nSignificant judgments and assumptions for all quantitative goodwill tests performed include discount rates, control premiums, terminal growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including revenue growth rates and profit margins.\n2024 Impairment Analysis\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company performed goodwill and intangible assets impairment monitoring procedures for all of its reporting units and concluded the delta between market capitalization and book value, continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market, and uncertainty related to affiliate and sports rights renewals, including the NBA, represented a triggering event for the Networks reporting unit.\n81\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs a result, the Company elected to perform a quantitative impairment assessment for all of its reporting units in the second quarter of 2024. For the Networks reporting unit, fair value was determined using a DCF method. The key judgments and assumptions used in the DCF method to determine the fair value of the Networks reporting unit were as follows:\n•    The expected future cash flows in terms of their amount and timing. These cash flows, utilized in the DCF analysis, are derived from the reporting unit’s budget and its strategic long-term plan, which reflect expectations based upon operating performance and assumptions consistent with those of a market participant with regards to affiliate revenue, sports rights, and continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market.\n•    Long-term growth rate of negative \n3\n%.\n•    A discount rate of \n10.5\n%. This is reflective of the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit and market conditions.\n Given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a DCF analysis, actual results may differ from those used in the valuations.\nThe carrying value of the Networks reporting unit exceeded its fair value and the Company recorded a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $\n9.1\n billion during the second quarter of 2024 in impairments and loss on dispositions in the consolidated statements of operations. The goodwill impairment charge does not have an impact on the calculation of the Company’s financial covenants under the Company’s debt arrangements.\nAs of October 1, 2024, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all of its reporting units. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, \nno\n impairment was recorded. The DTC reporting unit had headroom of \n20\n%. The Studios reporting unit, which had headroom of \n16\n%, and the Networks reporting unit, which had headroom of \n12\n%, both had fair values in excess of carrying value of less than 20%. The fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of DCF and market valuation methodologies.\nThe Company continues to monitor its reporting units for triggers that could impact the recoverability of goodwill. Long-term trends and risks the Company is monitoring in its ongoing assessment include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nthe delta between market capitalization and book value;\n•\nuncertainty related to affiliate rights renewals associated with the Company’s Networks and DTC reporting units;\n•\ndeclining levels of global GDP growth and continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market associated with the Company’s Networks reporting unit;\n•\ncontent licensing trends and volatility related to the performance of theatrical film and game slates in the Company’s Studios reporting unit; and\n•\nrisks in executing the projected growth strategies of the Company’s DTC reporting unit.\n2023 and 2022 Impairment Analysis\nFor the 2023 and 2022 annual impairment tests, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, \nno\n impairment was recorded.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe determination of fair value of the Company’s reporting units represents a Level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. Changes in significant judgments and estimates could significantly impact the determined fair value of the reporting unit or the valuation of intangible assets. Changes to assumptions that would decrease the fair value of the reporting unit may result in corresponding increases to the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit.\nNOTE 6. \nRESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES\nIn connection with the completion of its Merger with the WarnerMedia Business of AT&T on April 8, 2022, the Company has announced and has taken actions to implement projects to achieve cost synergies for the Company, which include, among other things, strategic content programming assessments, organization restructuring, facility consolidation activities, and other contract termination costs.

DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nMost of the Company’s distribution contracts are licenses of functional intellectual property where revenue is derived from royalty-based arrangements, for which revenues are recorded as a function of royalties earned to date instead of estimating incremental royalty contract revenue. However, there are certain other distribution arrangements that are fixed price or contain minimum guarantees that extend beyond one year. The Company recognizes revenue for fixed fee distribution contracts monthly based on minimum monthly fees by calculating one twelfth of annual license fees specified in its distribution contracts, or based on the pro-rata fees earned calculated on the license fees specified in the distribution contract.\nThe Company’s content licensing contracts and sports sublicensing deals are licenses of functional intellectual property.\nThe Company’s brand licensing contracts are licenses of symbolic intellectual property.\nThe Company’s advertising contracts are principally generated from the sale of advertising campaigns comprised of multiple commercial units. In contracts with guaranteed impressions, we have identified the overall advertising campaign as the performance obligation to be satisfied over time, and impressions delivered against the satisfaction of our guarantee as the measure of progress. Certain of these arrangements extend beyond one year.\nThe following table presents a summary of remaining performance obligations by contract type (in millions).\nContract Type\nDecember 31, 2024\nDuration\nDistribution - fixed price or minimum guarantee\n$\n2,407\n \nThrough 2031\nContent licensing and sports sublicensing\n4,416\n \nThrough 2032\nBrand licensing\n3,006\n \nThrough 2052\nAdvertising\n757\n \nThrough 2030\nOther\n133\n \nThrough 2029\nTotal\n$\n10,719\n \nThe value of unsatisfied performance obligations disclosed above does not include: (i) contracts involving variable consideration for which revenues are recognized in accordance with the sales or usage-based royalty exception, which typically have a similar duration as the contracts disclosed above, and (ii) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, such as most advertising contracts; however for content licensing revenues, including revenues associated with the licensing of theatrical and television product for television and streaming services, the Company has included all contracts regardless of duration.\nNOTE 8. \nSALES OF RECEIVABLES\nRevolving Receivables Program\nDuring 2024, the Company amended its revolving receivables program to reduce the facility limit to $\n5,200\n million and extend the program to June 2025.

DCL may also request additional commitments up to $\n1.0\n billion from the lenders upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The obligations of the borrowers under the Credit Agreement are unsecured and are guaranteed by the Company, Scripps Networks, and WMH. The Credit Agreement is available on a revolving basis until October 2029, with an option for up to \ntwo\n additional \n364\n-day renewal periods subject to the lenders’ consent.\nAdditionally, the Company's commercial paper program is supported by the Credit Facility.

As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts, fixed-to-fixed currency swaps, total return swaps, and interest rate swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency, market value and interest rate exposures. The Company’s objective is to reduce earnings volatility by offsetting gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them. The Company does not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\n92\nWARNER BROS.

(See Note 11.)\nDerivatives Designated for Hedge Accounting \nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency risk related to revenues, production rebates, and production expenses. As production spend occurs or when rebate receivables are recognized, foreign forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are de-designated. Upon de-designation, gains and losses on these derivatives directly impact earnings in the same line and same period as the hedged risk. These cash flow hedges are carried at fair market value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Hedge effectiveness is assessed using the spot method, with fair market value changes recorded in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings. Excluded components, including forward points, are included in current earnings.\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk associated with its British Pound Sterling denominated debt and executed a fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swap in 2022 to mitigate this risk. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company unwound the cross-currency swaps related to its Sterling debt and recognized a gain of $\n76\n million as an adjustment to other comprehensive income.\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with future issuances of debt and unwound the forward starting swap derivatives designated as hedging instruments to mitigate this risk in 2022. Realized gains from these derivatives will remain in other comprehensive loss until the debt is issued during the hedging window or the hedging window expires, which extends through 2025, and interest payments are made.

Simultaneously, the Company entered into a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge to allow the Company to mitigate the variability in the fair value of its senior notes due to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate. Changes in the fair value of the senior note and the interest rate swap were recorded in interest expense, net. The fair value hedge was settled during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nDerivatives Not Designated for Hedge Accounting\nThe Company has deferred compensation plans that have risk related to the fair market value gains and losses on investments and uses total return swaps to mitigate this risk. The gains and losses associated with these swaps are recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses, offsetting the deferred compensation investment gains and losses.\nThe Company is exposed to risk of secured overnight financing rate changes in connection with securitization interest paid on the receivables securitization program.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the increase in income tax expense compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in pre-tax book loss (excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge), an increase in state and local income taxes (including a state deferred tax adjustment recorded in the year ended December 31, 2024 and a one-time favorable release of an unrecognized state tax benefit in 2023 that did not recur in 2024), and a one-time favorable release of an unrecognized U.S. tax benefit in 2023 that did not recur in 2024.\n99\nWARNER BROS.

The decrease in tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in pre-tax book loss and the effect of foreign operations, including taxation and allocation of income and losses across various foreign jurisdictions. These decreases were partially offset by an unrecognized state tax benefit remeasurement following a multi-year tax settlement and a favorable state deferred tax adjustment recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023.

DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (without related interest and penalty amounts) is as follows (in millions).\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n2,147\n \n$\n1,929\n \n$\n420\n \nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n148\n \n147\n \n302\n \nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n250\n \n195\n \n35\n \nAdditions for tax positions acquired in business combinations\n—\n \n247\n \n1,353\n \nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n(\n76\n)\n(\n275\n)\n(\n114\n)\nSettlements\n(\n30\n)\n(\n46\n)\n(\n20\n)\nReductions due to lapse of statutes of limitations\n(\n51\n)\n(\n62\n)\n(\n34\n)\nChanges due to foreign currency exchange rates\n(\n17\n)\n12\n \n(\n13\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n2,371\n \n$\n2,147\n \n$\n1,929\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, if the Company were to recognize the full amount of unrecognized tax benefits, $\n2,182\n million would reduce the Company’s income tax expense and effective tax rate after giving effect to interest deductions and offsetting benefits from other tax jurisdictions.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for its 2012 to 2019 consolidated federal income tax returns. It is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to audit by any jurisdiction for years prior to 2008. Adjustments that arose from the completion of audits for certain tax years have been included in the change in unrecognized tax benefits in the table above.\nIt is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as $\n67\n million within the next twelve months as a result of ongoing audits, foreign judicial proceedings, lapses of statutes of limitations, or regulatory developments.\nAs of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company had accrued approximately $\n732\n million, $\n571\n million, and $\n413\n million, respectively, of total interest and penalties payable related to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposed a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest some of these funds outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the U.S. However, if these funds were to be needed in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay non-U.S. taxes to repatriate them. The determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (“GloBE”) model rules, issued under the OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, introduce a global minimum tax of 15% applicable to multinational enterprise groups with consolidated financial statement revenue in excess of €750 million. Numerous foreign jurisdictions have already enacted tax legislation based on the GloBE rules, with some effective as early as January 1, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we recognized a nominal income tax expense for Pillar Two GloBE minimum tax. The Company is continuously monitoring the evolving application of this legislation and assessing its potential impact on our future tax liability.\nNOTE 17. \nRETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS\nThe Company has defined contribution, defined benefit, and other savings plans for the benefit of its employees that meet eligibility requirements.\n101\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDefined Contribution Plans\nEligible employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to the plans, which may be subject to certain statutory limitations. The Company contributes to certain of the plans to either match qualifying employee contributions or as discretionary contributions. The Company made total contributions of $\n204\n million, $\n210\n million, and $\n188\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s contributions were recorded in cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations.\nExecutive Deferred Compensation Plans\nThe Company has deferred compensation plans through which certain senior-level employees may elect to defer a portion of their eligible compensation. Distributions from the deferred compensation plans are generally made following separation from service or other events as specified in the plan. In certain plans, the Company may make discretionary contributions to employee accounts. While these plans are unfunded, the Company has established separate rabbi trusts used to provide for certain of these benefits. The accounts of the separate rabbi trusts are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The investments are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred compensation obligation is included in accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The values of the investments and deferred compensation obligation are recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the investments are included as a component of other income (expense), net, on the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation obligation are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. (See Note 14 and Note 18.)\nMultiemployer Benefit Plans\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain of our union-represented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer pension plans in that (i) contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, which is referred to as a withdrawal liability; and (iii) actions taken by a participating employer that lead to a deterioration of the financial health of a multiemployer pension plan may result in the unfunded obligations of the multiemployer pension plan being borne by its remaining participating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and retired participants. The Company does not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s contributions to multiemployer pension and health and welfare benefit plans (in millions).\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPension benefits\n$\n115\n \n$\n128\n \n$\n112\n \nHealth and welfare benefits\n248\n \n153\n \n182\n \nTotal contributions\n$\n363\n \n$\n281\n \n$\n294\n \nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company participates in and/or sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan that covers certain U.S. based employees and several U.S. and non-U.S. nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that are noncontributory. The Company’s pension plans consist of both funded and unfunded plans.\nThe Company also holds net assets and net liabilities on behalf of other U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. The plan provisions vary by plan and by country. Some of these plans are unfunded and all are noncontributory. At a plan level, net asset positions are recorded in other noncurrent assets, and net liability positions are recorded in accrued liabilities and/or other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n102\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDiscount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels, and mortality rates are key assumptions used in determining the benefit obligation. \nThe table below describes how the assumptions are determined.\nAssumption\nDescription\nDiscount rate\nBased on a bond portfolio approach that includes high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the Company’s expected benefit payments from the plans.\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets\nBased on the weighted-average expected rate of return and capital market forecasts for each asset class employed and also considers the Company’s historical compounded return on plan assets for \n10\n and \n15\n-year periods.\nIncrease in compensation levels\nBased on past experience and the near-term outlook.\nMortality \nVarious mortality tables adjusted and projected using mortality improvement rates.\nNet Periodic Pension Cost\nExpense recognized for the pension plans is based upon actuarial valuations. Inherent in those valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and, where applicable, expected returns on assets. The service cost component of net periodic pension cost is recorded in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations, while the remaining components are recorded in other income (expense), net. Net periodic pension cost was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \n103\nWARNER BROS.

There are no restrictions on the types of investments held in the pension plans, which are invested using a combination of active management and passive investment strategies. Risk is controlled through diversification among multiple asset classes, managers, styles, and securities. Risk is further controlled both at the manager and asset class levels by assigning return targets and evaluating performance against these targets. \nThe following table presents the weighted average pension plans asset allocations by asset category (in millions).\nDecember 31, 2024\nInvestment Type\nTarget\nActual\nDebt securities\n4\n \n%\n4\n \n%\nEquity securities\n10\n \n%\n10\n \n%\nFixed income securities\n73\n \n%\n65\n \n%\nMulti-asset credit fund\n5\n \n%\n11\n \n%\nReal assets\n4\n \n%\n2\n \n%\nHedge funds\n2\n \n%\n7\n \n%\nCash\n2\n \n%\n1\n \n%\nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSupplier Finance Programs\nConsistent with customary industry practice, the Company generally pays certain content producers at or near the completion of the production cycle. In these arrangements, content producers may earn fees upon contractual milestones to be invoiced at or near completion of production. In these instances, the Company accrues the content in progress in accordance with the contractual milestones. Certain of the Company’s content producers sell their related receivables to a bank intermediary who provides payments that coincide with these contractual production milestones upon confirmation with the Company of our obligation to the content producer. This confirmation does not involve a security interest in the underlying content or otherwise result in the payable receiving seniority with respect to other payables of the Company. Invoices processed through the program are subject to a one-year maximum tenor. The Company does not incur any fees or expenses associated with the paying agent services, and this service may be terminated by the Company or the financial institution upon \n30\n days’ notice.

Redeemable noncontrolling interests reflected as of the balance sheet date are the greater of the noncontrolling interest balances adjusted for comprehensive income items and distributions or the redemption values remeasured at the period end foreign exchange rates. Adjustments to the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interests to redemption value as a result of changes in exchange rates are reflected in currency translation adjustments, a component of other comprehensive loss. Such currency translation adjustments to redemption value are allocated to the Company’s stockholders only. Redeemable noncontrolling interest adjustments of carrying value to redemption value are reflected in retained earnings, unless there is an accumulated deficit, in which case the adjustments are reflected in additional paid-in capital. The adjustment of carrying value to the redemption value that reflects a redemption in excess of fair value is included as an adjustment to income from continuing operations available to the Company’s stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share.\n (See Note 3.) \nThe table below summarizes the Company’s redeemable noncontrolling interests balances (in millions).\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nDiscovery Family\n$\n86\n \n$\n156\n \nOther \n23\n \n9\n \nTotal\n$\n109\n \n$\n165\n \nThe table below presents the reconciliation of changes in redeemable noncontrolling interests (in millions).\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n165\n \n$\n318\n \n$\n363\n \nCash distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interests\n(\n35\n)\n(\n30\n)\n(\n50\n)\nReclassification of redeemable noncontrolling interest to noncontrolling interest\n—\n \n(\n22\n)\n—\n \nRedemption of redeemable noncontrolling interest\n—\n \n(\n111\n)\n—\n \nComprehensive income adjustments:\nNet income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests\n(\n42\n)\n9\n \n6\n \nCurrency translation on redemption values\n—\n \n(\n3\n)\n(\n5\n)\nRetained earnings adjustments:\nAdjustments of carrying value to redemption value (redemption value does not equal fair value)\n18\n \n2\n \n—\n \nAdjustments of carrying value to redemption value (redemption value equals fair value)\n3\n \n2\n \n4\n \nEnding balance\n$\n109\n \n$\n165\n \n$\n318\n \nThe Company’s significant redeemable noncontrolling interests are described below.\nDiscovery Family\nHasbro Inc. (“Hasbro”) had the right to put the entirety of its remaining \n40\n% interest in Discovery Family to the Company at any time during the one-year period beginning December 31, 2021, or in the event the Company’s performance obligation related to Discovery Family was not met. Embedded in the redeemable noncontrolling interest was a call right that was exercisable for one year after December 31, 2021. Neither the put nor the call was exercised in 2022. In December 2022, Hasbro and WBD signed an amendment to the previous agreement extending the put-call election to the period January 31, 2025 to March 31, 2025.\n \nUpon the exercise of the put or call options, the price to be paid for the redeemable noncontrolling interest is a function of the then-current fair market value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest, to which certain discounts and redemption floor values may apply in specified situations depending upon the party exercising the put or call and the basis for the exercise of the put or call. \nMTG\nGoldenTree acquired a put right that required the Company to either purchase all of GoldenTree’s noncontrolling \n32.5\n% interest in the joint venture at fair value or participate in an initial public offering for the joint venture. In 2022, GoldenTree exercised its put right and in 2023, the Company finalized its purchase of GoldenTree’s \n32.5\n% noncontrolling interest for $\n49\n million.\n110\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther\nIn August 2023, the Company and JCOM Co., Ltd. (“JCOM”) executed a series of transaction agreements to which the Company and JCOM each contributed certain rights, liabilities, or rights via license agreements to Discovery Japan, Inc. (“JVCo”), an existing \n80\n/\n20\n joint venture between the Company and JCOM, in exchange for new common shares of JVCo, resulting in the Company and JCOM owning \n51\n% and \n49\n% of JVCo, respectively. Retaining controlling financial interest subsequent to the transaction, the Company continues to consolidate the joint venture. As the terms of the agreement no longer incorporate JCOM’s option to put its noncontrolling interest to the Company, JCOM’s noncontrolling interest was reclassified from redeemable noncontrolling interest to noncontrolling interest outside of stockholders’ equity on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.\nNOTE 20. \nNONCONTROLLING INTEREST\nThe Company has a controlling interest in the TV Food Network Partnership (the “Partnership”), which includes the Food Network and Cooking Channel. Food Network and Cooking Channel are operated and organized under the terms of the Partnership. The Company holds \n80\n% of the voting interest and \n68.7\n% of the economic interest in the Partnership. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Partnership agreement was extended and specified a dissolution date of December 31, 2025. If the term of the Partnership is not extended prior to the dissolution date of December 31, 2025, the Partnership agreement permits the Company, as holder of \n80\n% of the applicable votes, to reconstitute the Partnership and continue its business. If for some reason the Partnership is not continued, it will be required to limit its activities to winding up, settling debts, liquidating assets and distributing proceeds to the partners in proportion to their partnership interests. Ownership interests attributable to the noncontrolling owner are presented as noncontrolling interests on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under the terms of the Partnership agreement, the noncontrolling owner cannot force a redemption outside of the Company’s control. As such, the noncontrolling interests in the Partnership are reflected as a component of permanent equity in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 21. \nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions with related parties. Related parties include entities that share common directorship, such as Liberty Global plc (“Liberty Global”), Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty Broadband”) and their subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively the “Liberty Group”). The Company’s board of directors includes Dr. John Malone, who is Chairman of the Board of Liberty Global and Liberty Broadband and beneficially owns approximately \n30\n% and \n48\n% of the aggregate voting power with respect to the election of directors of Liberty Global and Liberty Broadband, respectively. The majority of the revenue earned from the Liberty Group relates to multi-year network distribution arrangements. Related party transactions also include revenues and expenses for content and services provided to or acquired from equity method investees, or minority partners of consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe table below presents a summary of the transactions with related parties (in millions).\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues and service charges \n(a)\n$\n1,404\n \n$\n2,790\n \n$\n2,533\n \nExpenses\n$\n268\n \n$\n357\n \n$\n406\n \nDistributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests\n$\n193\n \n$\n301\n \n$\n300\n \n(a) \nThe decrease in revenue and service charges in 2024 is primarily attributable to transactions with certain entities that are no longer considered related parties, as such entities and the Company ceased to share common directorship in 2024.\nThe table below presents receivables due from and payables due to related parties (in millions).\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nReceivables\n$\n254\n \n$\n363\n \nPayables\n$\n13\n \n$\n18\n \nIn October 2024, the Company sold its minority interests in Formula E to Liberty Global and recorded a $\n61\n million gain not included in the table above.

DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 22. \nCOMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, AND GUARANTEES\nCommitments\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into various commitments, which primarily include programming and talent arrangements, operating and finance leases (see Note 12), arrangements to purchase various goods and services, long-term debt (see Note 11), pension funding and payments (see Note 17), and future funding commitments to equity method investees (see Note 10) (in millions).\nYear Ending December 31,\nContent\nOther Purchase Obligations\nOther Employee Obligations\nTotal\n2025\n$\n5,956\n \n$\n1,119\n \n$\n443\n \n$\n7,518\n \n2026\n3,976\n \n819\n \n269\n \n5,064\n \n2027\n3,241\n \n755\n \n108\n \n4,104\n \n2028\n2,589\n \n173\n \n52\n \n2,814\n \n2029\n1,447\n \n39\n \n24\n \n1,510\n \nThereafter\n4,321\n \n6\n \n64\n \n4,391\n \nTotal\n$\n21,530\n \n$\n2,911\n \n$\n960\n \n$\n25,401\n \nThe commitments disclosed above exclude liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheets.\nContent purchase obligations include commitments associated with third-party producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks and DTC services. Production and licensing contracts generally require the purchase of a specified number of episodes and payments during production or over the term of a license, and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place. If the content is ultimately never produced, our commitments expire without obligation. \nOther purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. Significant purchase obligations include transmission services, television rating services, marketing commitments and research, equipment purchases, and information technology and other services. Some of these contracts do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a \n30\n-day to \n60\n-day advance notice without penalty, and are not included in the table above past the 30-day to 60-day advance notice period. Other purchase obligations also include future funding commitments to equity method investees. Although the Company had funding commitments to equity method investees as of December 31, 2024, the Company may also provide uncommitted additional funding to its equity method investments in the future. (See Note 10.)\nOther employee obligations are primarily related to employment agreements with creative talent for certain broadcast networks.\nSix Flags Guarantee\nIn connection with the WarnerMedia Business’ former investment in the Six Flags (as defined below) theme parks located in Georgia and Texas (collectively, the “Parks”), in 1997, certain subsidiaries of the Company agreed to guarantee (the “Six Flags Guarantee”) certain obligations of the partnerships that hold the Parks (the “Partnerships”) for the benefit of the limited partners in such Partnerships, including annual payments made to the Parks or to the limited partners and additional obligations at the end of the respective terms for the Partnerships in 2027 and 2028 (the “Guaranteed Obligations”). Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (formerly known as Six Flags, Inc. and Premier Parks Inc.) (“Six Flags”), which has the controlling interest in the Parks, has agreed, pursuant to a subordinated indemnity agreement (the “Subordinated Indemnity Agreement”), to guarantee the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations when due and to indemnify the Company, among others, if the Six Flags Guarantee is called upon. If Six Flags defaults on its indemnification obligations, the Company has the right to acquire control of the managing partner of the Parks. Six Flags’ obligations to the Company are further secured by its interest in all limited partnership units held by Six Flags.\nIn December 2024, Six Flags provided notice of its exercise of the option related to the theme parks located in Georgia that requires the redemption of all the limited partnership units that Six Flags does not then own in the Georgia Partnership in January 2027. Pursuant to the exercise of the option, all of such outstanding limited partnership interests will be redeemed, and Six Flags will also acquire certain related entity general partnership and managing member interests.\n112\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBased on the Company’s evaluation of the current facts and circumstances surrounding the Guaranteed Obligations and the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement, it is unable to predict the loss, if any, that may be incurred under the Guaranteed Obligations, and no liability for the arrangements has been recognized as of December 31, 2024. Because of the specific circumstances surrounding the arrangements and the fact that no active or observable market exists for this type of financial guarantee, the Company is unable to determine a current fair value for the Guaranteed Obligations and related Subordinated Indemnity Agreement. The aggregate gross undiscounted estimated future cash flow requirements covered by the Six Flags Guarantee over the remaining term (through 2028) are $\n589\n million. To date, \nno\n payments have been made by the Company pursuant to the Six Flags Guarantee.\nContingencies\nOther Contingent Commitments\nOther contingent commitments primarily include contingent payments for post-production term advance obligations on a certain co-financing arrangement, as well as operating lease commitment guarantees, letters of credit, bank guarantees, and surety bonds, which generally support performance and payments for a wide range of global contingent and firm obligations, including insurance, litigation appeals, real estate leases, and other operational needs. The Company’s other contingent commitments at December 31, 2024 were immaterial. \nPut Rights\nThe Company has granted put rights to non-controlling interest holders in certain consolidated subsidiaries, but the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any payment. (See Note 19.)\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to various litigation matters and claims, including claims related to employees, stockholders, vendors, other business partners, government regulations, or intellectual property, as well as disputes and matters involving counterparties to contractual agreements, such as disputes arising out of definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger. A determination as to the amount of the accrual required for such contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgment about future events. In connection with a contract dispute arising out of definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger, the Company established an immaterial accrual in the first quarter of 2024. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the reasonably possible range of loss or any loss in excess of the accrual associated with such matter. There can be no assurance that any settlement of such dispute will be reached and, if a settlement is reached, what the total dollar amount will be of any such settlement.\nThe Company may not currently be able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss for certain matters until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of such loss. In the absence of sufficient information to support an assessment of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, no accrual for such contingencies is made and no loss or range of loss is disclosed. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and the impact of the final resolution of these matters on the Company’s results of operations in a particular subsequent reporting period is not known, management does not currently believe that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future consolidated financial position, future results of operations, or cash flows.\nGuarantees\nThere were \nno\n guarantees recorded under ASC 460 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company may provide or receive indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for certain obligations of a divested business in the event that a third party does not fulfill its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and estimable. There were \nno\n material amounts for indemnifications or other contingencies recorded as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nNOTE 23. \nREPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nThe Company’s operating segments are determined based on: (i) financial information reviewed by its chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), (ii) internal management and related reporting structure, and (iii) the basis upon which the CEO makes resource allocation decisions.\n113\nWARNER BROS. DISCOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Company’s, except that certain inter-segment transactions that are eliminated for consolidation are not eliminated at the segment level. Inter-segment transactions primarily include advertising and content licenses. The Company generally records inter-segment transactions of content licenses at market value. The Company does not report assets by segment because it is not used to allocate resources or evaluate segment performance. \nThe Company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding:\n•\nemployee share-based compensation;\n•\ndepreciation and amortization;\n•\nrestructuring and facility consolidation;\n•\ncertain impairment charges;\n•\ngains and losses on business and asset dispositions;\n•\nthird-party transaction and integration costs;\n•\namortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content;\n•\namortization of capitalized interest for content; and \n•\nother items impacting comparability.\n The CODM uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of the segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes employee share-based compensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. Integration costs include transformative system implementations and integrations, such as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, and may take several years to complete. The Company also excludes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content (which is included in consolidated costs of revenues), and amortization of capitalized interest for content, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. We prospectively updated certain corporate allocations at the beginning of 2024. The impact to prior periods was immaterial.\n \nThe tables below present summarized financial information for each of the Company’s reportable segments, corporate, and inter-segment eliminations, and other (in millions).\nRevenues\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStudios\n$\n11,607\n \n$\n12,192\n \n$\n9,731\n \nNetworks\n20,175\n \n21,244\n \n19,348\n \nDTC\n10,313\n \n10,154\n \n7,274\n \nCorporate\n8\n \n—\n \n30\n \nInter-segment eliminations \n(\n2,782\n)\n(\n2,269\n)\n(\n2,566\n)\nTotal revenues\n$\n39,321\n \n$\n41,321\n \n$\n33,817\n \n114\nWARNER BROS.

On February 20, 2024, FuboTV Inc. and FuboTV Media Inc. (collectively, “Fubo”) filed a lawsuit against Disney, including certain affiliates, Fox, and WBD (collectively, the “Defendants”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging claims under federal and New York antitrust laws.\nOn January 6, 2025, Disney announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to combine certain of Hulu Live TV’s assets with Fubo (the “Fubo Transaction”) and provide Fubo a senior unsecured term loan of up to $\n145\n million in January 2026 (the “Fubo Loan”). If Disney funds the Fubo Loan prior to the consummation of the Fubo Transaction, the Company and Fox will participate in a portion of the Fubo Loan by providing loans to Disney with substantially the same economic terms as the Fubo Loan. A $\n130\n million termination fee will be payable by Disney to Fubo if the transaction is terminated under certain circumstances. The Company and Fox have agreed to reimburse a portion of the termination fee to Disney if it becomes payable. In addition, the Defendants reached a settlement with Fubo related to Fubo’s antitrust claims and collectively paid $\n220\n million to Fubo in January 2025, of which the Company’s share was $\n55\n million.\nOn January 10, 2025, the Defendants announced their decision to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch its streaming service effective immediately. \nDebt\nOn January 28, 2025, WMH issued a conditional notice for the redemption in full of all $\n1,500\n million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding \n6.412\n% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”), in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the Notes. Such redemption was funded with the proceeds of borrowings pursuant to a new $\n1,500\n million \n364\n-day senior unsecured term loan credit facility entered into on January 28, 2025 by DCL, WBD, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of WBD party thereto, the lenders party thereto, and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. The Notes were redeemed on February 7, 2025.\nJoint Venture\nOn January 31, 2025, the Company contributed a \n70\n% interest in its music catalog to a joint venture with Cutting Edge Group in exchange for net proceeds of $\n601\n million. The Company will retain a controlling financial interest and consolidate the joint venture as a VIE.\n117\nITEM 9.

Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” which is incorporated herein by reference.\nReport of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting is set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,” which is incorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.
