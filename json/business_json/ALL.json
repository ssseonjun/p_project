    "item1": "Item 1. Business.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2024 and 2023 results and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 results and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for 2023, filed February 21, 2024. \nThe most important factors we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance for the Company include:\n•\nAllstate Protection\n: premium, policies in force (“PIF”), new business sales, price changes, claim frequency and severity, catastrophes, loss ratio, expenses, underwriting results and combined ratio\n•\nProtection Services\n: revenues, premium written, PIF and adjusted net income\n•\nAllstate Health and Benefits\n: premiums, other revenue, new business sales, PIF, benefit ratio, expenses and adjusted net income\n•\nInvestments\n: exposure to market risk, asset allocation, credit quality, total return, net investment income, cash flows, net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, unrealized capital gains and losses, long-term returns and fixed income portfolio duration\n•\nFinancial condition\n: liquidity, parent holding company deployable assets, financial strength ratings, operating leverage, debt levels, book value per share and return on equity\nMeasuring segment profit or loss\nThe measure of segment profit or loss used in evaluating performance is underwriting income for the Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability segments and adjusted net income for the Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits, and Corporate and Other segments. \nUnderwriting income (loss)\n is calculated as premiums earned and other revenue, less claims and claims expense (“losses”), amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”), operating costs and expenses, amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles, and restructuring and related charges, as determined using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We \nuse this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze profitability. \nAdjusted net income (loss)\n is net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders, excluding:\n•\nNet gains and losses on investments and derivatives\n•\nPension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses\n•\nAmortization or impairment of purchased intangibles\n•\nGain or loss on disposition\n•\nAdjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years\n•\nIncome tax expense or benefit on reconciling items\nMacroeconomic impacts\nMacroeconomic factors have and may continue to impact the results of our operations, financial condition and liquidity, such as U.S. government fiscal and monetary policies, conflict in the Middle East, the Russia/Ukraine conflict, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and potential trade policy actions, such as tariffs and quotas. These factors should be considered when comparing the current period to prior periods. Macroeconomic impacts are disclosed in Part 1 “",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors’’, including the risk factors titled “\nA large-scale pandemic, the occurrence of terrorism, military actions, political and social unrest or other disruptive or destabilizing events may have an adverse effect on our business\n” and “\nConditions in the global economy and capital markets could adversely affect the business and results of operations\n”. This is not inclusive of all potential impacts and should not be treated as such. Within the MD&A, we have included further disclosures related to macroeconomic impacts on our 2024 results.\nDispositions \nOn August 13, 2024, we entered into a share purchase agreement with StanCorp Financial Group, Inc. to sell American Heritage Life Insurance Company and American Heritage Service Company, comprising our employer voluntary benefits business for approximately $2.0 billion in cash. The employer voluntary benefits business is reported in the Allstate Health and Benefits segment, and beginning in the third quarter of 2024, the assets and liabilities of the business were classified as held for sale. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. \nOn January 30, 2025, Allstate entered into an agreement with Nationwide Life Insurance Company to sell Direct General Life Insurance Company, NSM Sales Corporation and The Association Benefits Solution, LLC, comprising the group health business for approximately $1.25 billion in cash, adjusted for the closing balance sheet. The group health business is reported in the Allstate Health and Benefits segment, and beginning in the first quarter of 2025, the assets \nThe Allstate Corporation      35\n2024 Form 10-K\nand liabilities of the business will be classified as held for sale. The transaction is expected to close during 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The individual health business will either be retained or divested.\nThe transaction prices less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of both transactions, resulting in an expected gain that will be recognized at closing of each transaction. The ultimate amount of the anticipated gain on the sales will be impacted by purchase price adjustments associated with certain pre-close transactions, changes in the carrying value of net assets, changes in accumulated other comprehensive income and the related tax effects. \nSee Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the employer voluntary benefits disposition.\n2024 Operating priorities and results\nAllstate continued to focus on its operating priorities while successfully executing a comprehensive plan to improve auto insurance profitability and making substantial progress in advancing Transformative Growth. The table below summarizes the results of our 2024 Operating Priorities.\n2024 Operating priorities\n \n(1)\nGrow Customer Base\nAchieve 2024 Plan Growth Objectives\nConsolidated policies in force reached 208 million, a 7.2% increase from prior year. Allstate Protection policies in force decreased by 0.6% compared to the prior year, as continued growth in the homeowners insurance business was more than offset by declines in the auto insurance business.\nProtection Services policies in force and revenue increased 9.3% and 16.7%, respectively, primarily due to growth at Allstate Protection Plans through expanding distribution relationships and protection offerings.\nAchieve Target Economic Returns on Capital\nAchieve 2024 Plan Returns\nReturn on average Allstate common shareholders’ equity was 25.8% in 2024.\nTotal return on the $72.61 billion investment portfolio was 3.8% in 2024. Proactive portfolio management repositioned the fixed income portfolio into longer duration and higher-yielding assets to increase income.\nThe Property-Liability combined ratio of 94.3 for the full year decreased compared to the prior year primarily reflecting successful execution of the Company’s comprehensive auto insurance profitability plan and lower catastrophe losses.\nExecute Transformative Growth\nImprove Customer Value\nEnterprise Net Promoter Score, which measures how likely customers are to recommend Allstate, finished below the prior year, reflecting the impact of substantial price increases necessary to offset higher loss costs.\nImproved over 25 million customer interactions.\nExpand Customer Access\nIncreased auto insurance new issued applications in all channels.\nNational General continues to build a strong competitive position in independent agent distribution with successful expansion on non-standard auto sales and roll-out of our auto and home Custom360 product now available in 30 states.\nIncrease Sophistication and Investment in Customer Acquisition\nIncreased advertising and reduced underwriting restrictions as higher average premium outpaced increased loss costs per policy.\nDeploy New Technology Ecosystems\nContinued roll-out of Affordable, Simple and Connected auto insurance offering now available in 31 states for auto, 28 states for renters and Affordable, Simple and Connected homeowners insurance offering now available in 4 states.\nContinued to build a digital enterprise by expanding utilization of machine-based learning and artificial intelligence.\nDrive Organizational Transformation\nStreamlined the organization by reducing bureaucracy, risk aversion and organizational silos.\n(1)\n2025 operating priorities will remain mostly consistent with the 2024\n \npriorities. \n36      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K\nConsolidated net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders\n($ in millions)\nConsolidated net income applicable to common shareholders\n was $4.55 billion in 2024 compared to net loss of $316 million in 2023, primarily due to improved underwriting results from increased earned premium and improved loss trends.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, return on average Allstate common shareholders’ equity was 25.8% compared to (2.0)% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.\nTotal revenue\n($ in millions)\nTotal revenue \nincreased 12.3% to $64.11 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to premium rate increases and higher net investment income.\nNet investment income\n($ in millions)\nNet investment income\n increased $614 million to $3.09 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher market-based investment results. Market-based results continue to benefit from portfolio repositioning into higher yielding fixed income securities and higher investment balances.\nFinancial highlights\nInvestments \ntotaled $72.61 billion as of December 31, 2024, increasing from $66.68 billion as of December 31, 2023.\nAllstate shareholders’ equity\n was $21.44 billion as of December 31, 2024 and $17.77 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to net income, partially offset by dividends to shareholders.\nBook value per diluted common share\n (ratio of Allstate common shareholders’ equity to total common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares outstanding) was $72.35 as of December 31, 2024, an increase of 21.8% from $59.39 as of December 31, 2023.\nReturn on average Allstate common shareholders’ equity \n For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, return on Allstate common shareholders’ equity was 25.8%, an increase of 27.8 points from (2.0)% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to net income applicable to common shareholders.\nThe Allstate Corporation      37\n2024 Form 10-K\nSummarized financial results\nYears Ended December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n \n \nProperty and casualty insurance premiums\n$\n56,388 \n$\n50,670 \n$\n45,904 \nAccident and health insurance premiums and contract charges\n1,921 \n1,846 \n1,832 \nOther revenue\n2,930 \n2,400 \n2,344 \nNet investment income \n3,092 \n2,478 \n2,403 \nNet gains (losses) on investments and derivatives \n(225)\n(300)\n(1,072)\nTotal revenues\n64,106\n \n57,094\n \n51,411\n \nCosts and expenses\n \n \nProperty and casualty insurance claims and claims expense\n(39,735)\n(41,070)\n(37,264)\nAccident, health and other policy benefits\n(1,241)\n(1,071)\n(1,042)\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n(8,039)\n(7,278)\n(6,634)\nOperating, restructuring and interest expenses\n(9,087)\n(7,685)\n(7,832)\nPension and other postretirement remeasurement gains (losses)\n37 \n(9)\n(116)\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n(280)\n(329)\n(353)\nTotal costs and expenses\n(58,345)\n(57,442)\n(53,241)\nIncome (loss) from operations before income tax expense\n5,761\n \n(348)\n(1,830)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n(1,162)\n135 \n488 \nNet income (loss)\n4,599\n \n(213)\n(1,342)\nLess: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest\n(68)\n(25)\n(53)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Allstate\n4,667\n \n(188)\n(1,289)\nPreferred stock dividends\n(117)\n(128)\n(105)\nNet income (loss) applicable to common shareholders\n$\n4,550\n \n$\n(316)\n$\n(1,394)\nSegment highlights\nAllstate Protection \nunderwriting income was $3.15 billion in 2024 compared to an underwriting loss of $2.09 billion in 2023, primarily due to increased premiums earned, favorable reserve reestimates and lower losses, partially offset by higher advertising costs.\nPremiums written increased 11.1% to $55.93 billion in 2024 compared to $50.35 billion in 2023, reflecting higher premiums in auto and homeowners insurance.\nProtection Services\n adjusted net income was $217 million in 2024 compared to $106 million in 2023. The increase in 2024 was due to premium growth at Allstate Protection Plans, improved claim severity at Allstate Roadside, higher lead sales revenue at Arity and both growth and lower costs at Allstate Identity Protection. Prior year adjusted net income was also negatively impacted by an increase in state income taxes for Allstate Dealer Services.\nPremiums and other revenues increased 15.7% or $401 million to $2.96 billion in 2024 from $2.56 billion in 2023 primarily due to Allstate Protection Plans.\nAllstate Health and Benefits\n adjusted net income was $186 million in 2024 compared to $242 million in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to increased benefit utilization across all lines of business.\nPremiums and contract charges totaled $1.92 billion in 2024, an increase of 4.1% from $1.85 billion in 2023, primarily due to growth in individual health and group health, partially offset by a decline in employer voluntary benefits.\nIncome taxes\nThe effective tax rate is the ratio of income tax expense (benefit) divided by income (loss) from operations before income tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we reported an effective tax rate of 20.2% based on total income tax expense of $1.16 billion on total income from operations before income tax expense of $5.76 billion. The effective rate in 2024 is lower than the federal statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to tax benefits derived from tax credits, tax-exempt interest income, and share-based payments, offset by state income tax expense.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we reported an effective tax rate of 38.8% based on a total income tax benefit of $135 million on the loss from operations before income tax benefit of $348 million. The effective tax rate in 2023 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 21% due to the additional tax benefit derived from tax credits, tax-exempt interest income and shared-based payments, offset by a change in valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions.\nFor additional information, see Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements.\n38      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nProperty-Liability\nProperty-Liability Operations\nOverview\n  Property-Liability operations consist of two reportable segments: Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources.\nWe do not allocate Property-Liability investment income, net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, or assets to the Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability segments. Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability level for decision-making purposes.\nGAAP operating ratios\n are used to measure our profitability to enhance an investor’s understanding of our financial results and are calculated as follows:\n•\nLoss ratio:\n \nthe ratio of claims and claims expense (loss adjustment expenses), to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.\n•\nExpense ratio:\n the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles and restructuring and related charges, less other revenue to premiums earned.\n•\nCombined ratio:\n the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.\nWe have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between periods. The impacts are calculated by taking the specific items noted below divided by Property-Liability premiums earned:\n•\nEffect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio:\n includes catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense\n•\nEffect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio\n•\nEffect of amortization of purchased intangibles on combined ratio\n•\nEffect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio\n•\nEffect of Run-off Property-Liability business on combined ratio:\n includes claims and claims expense, restructuring and related charges and operating costs and expenses in the Run-off Property-Liability segment\nPremium measures and statistics\n are used to analyze our premium trends and are calculated as follows:\n•\nPIF\n: policy counts are based on items rather than customers. A multi-car customer would generate multiple item (policy) counts, even if all cars were insured under one policy. Lender-placed policies are excluded from policy counts because relationships are with the lenders. \n•\nNew issued applications\n: item counts of automobile or homeowner insurance applications for insurance policies that were issued during the period, regardless of whether the customer was previously insured by another Allstate brand. \n•\nAverage premium-gross written (“average premium”)\n:\n gross premiums written divided by issued item count. Gross premiums written include the impacts from discounts, surcharges and ceded reinsurance premiums and exclude the impacts from mid-term premium adjustments and premium refund accruals. Average premiums represent the appropriate policy term for each line.\n•\nImplemented rate changes\n:\n \nrepresents the impact in the locations (U.S. states, the District of Columbia or Canadian provinces) where rate changes were implemented during the period as a percentage of total prior year-end premiums written.\nThe Allstate Corporation      39\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nProperty-Liability\nUnderwriting results\n($ in millions, except ratios)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPremiums written\n$\n55,926 \n$\n50,347 \n$\n45,787 \nPremiums earned\n$\n53,866 \n$\n48,427 \n$\n43,909 \nOther revenue\n1,895 \n1,545 \n1,416 \nClaims and claims expense\n(39,118)\n(40,453)\n(36,732)\nAmortization of DAC\n(6,676)\n(6,070)\n(5,570)\nOther costs and expenses\n(6,630)\n(5,255)\n(5,650)\nRestructuring and related charges \n(1)\n(51)\n(143)\n(44)\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n(206)\n(235)\n(240)\nUnderwriting income (loss)\n$\n3,080\n \n$\n(2,184)\n$\n(2,911)\nCatastrophe losses\nCatastrophe losses, excluding reserve reestimates\n$\n5,334 \n$\n5,660 \n$\n3,094 \nCatastrophe reserve reestimates\n (2)\n(370)\n(24)\n18 \nTotal catastrophe losses\n$\n4,964\n \n$\n5,636\n \n$\n3,112\n \nNon-catastrophe reserve reestimates \n(2)\n$\n62 \n$\n574 \n$\n1,726 \nPrior year reserve reestimates \n(2)\n(308)\n550 \n1,744 \nGAAP operating ratios\nLoss ratio\n72.6 \n83.5 \n83.6 \nExpense ratio\n \n(3)\n21.7 \n21.0 \n23.0 \nCombined ratio\n94.3 \n104.5 \n106.6 \nEffect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio \n9.2 \n11.6 \n7.1 \nEffect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio\n \n(0.5)\n1.2 \n3.9 \nEffect of catastrophe losses included in prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio\n(0.7)\n— \n— \nEffect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio \n(1)\n0.2 \n0.3 \n0.1 \nEffect of amortization of purchased intangibles on combined ratio\n0.3 \n0.5 \n0.5 \nEffect of Run-off Property-Liability business on combined ratio\n0.2 \n0.2 \n0.3 \n(1)\nRestructuring and related charges in 2024 primarily relate to the organizational transformation component of the Transformative Growth plan.

Estimated report year 2024 incurred claim severity for Allstate increased compared to report year 2023 for major coverages due to higher repair costs, a higher mix of total losses, an increase in claims with attorney representation, higher medical consumption, and inflation. Gross claim frequency decreased relative to the prior year. We continue to enhance our claims practices to manage loss costs by increasing resources and expanding re-inspections, accelerating resolution of bodily injury claims, and negotiating improved vendor services and parts agreements.\nHomeowners loss ratio\n decreased 17.3 points in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased premiums earned and lower losses.\nGross claim frequency decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to fewer claims reported related to water and fire perils. Paid claim severity increased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to inflationary loss cost pressure driven by increases in labor and materials costs. Homeowner paid claim severity can be impacted by both the mix of perils and the magnitude of specific losses paid during the period.\nOther personal lines loss ratio\n \nincreased 3.9 points in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher losses and unfavorable reserve development, partially offset by increased premiums earned.\nCommercial lines loss ratio\n \nincreased 5.7 points in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower \npremiums earned driven by Allstate brand strategy changes and unfavorable reserve development related to the shared economy business, partially offset by lower non-catastrophe losses.\nOther business lines loss ratio\n increased 7.4 points in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher losses.\nCatastrophe losses \ndecreased 11.9% or $672 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to lower losses per event for wind and hail events, partially offset by higher losses from hurricanes. Favorable prior year reserve reestimates of $370 million in 2024 were primarily due to reserve reestimates in homeowners lines for 2023 events.\nWe define a “catastrophe” as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first-party policyholders, or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms and freezes, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. \nWe are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism, civil unrest, wildfires or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.\nCatastrophe losses by the type of event\nFor the years ended December 31,\n($ in millions)\nNumber of events\n2024\nNumber of events\n2023\nNumber of events\n2022\nHurricanes/tropical storms\n5 \n$\n1,180 \n3 \n$\n66 \n2 \n$\n399 \nTornadoes\n2 \n85 \n4 \n189 \n4 \n192 \nWind/hail\n113 \n3,832 \n136 \n5,065 \n106 \n1,936 \nWildfires\n10 \n71 \n4 \n335 \n9 \n52 \nFreeze/other events\n2 \n166 \n2 \n5 \n3 \n515 \nPrior year reserve reestimates \n(1)\n(370)\n(24)\n18 \nTotal catastrophe losses\n132\n \n$\n4,964\n \n149\n \n$\n5,636\n \n124\n \n$\n3,112\n \n(1)\nIncludes reinsurance recoveries.\nCatastrophe management\nHistorical catastrophe experience \n For the last ten years, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our loss ratio was 8.6 points, but it has varied from 5.7 points to 11.6 points. The impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio in 2024 was 27.8 points compared to the average annual impact for the last ten years of 27.6 points. Over time, we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes by our participation in various state facilities. For further discussion of these facilities, see Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. However, the impact of these actions may \nbe diminished by the growth in insured values, the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and we may not be able to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts we consider sufficient at acceptable prices. In addition, in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers including the California FAIR Plan Association. Because of our participation in these and other state facilities such as wind pools, we may be \nThe Allstate Corporation      45\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nAllstate Protection\nexposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and to assessments from these facilities.\nWe have continued to take actions to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to catastrophic events while continuing to meet the needs of our customers, including the following:\n•\nContinuing to limit or not offer new homeowners, manufactured home and landlord package policy business in certain coastal geographies. Additionally, we:\n–\nReduced our exposure to high-risk areas, including California and Florida. We have decreased our overall homeowner exposure in California by more than 50% since 2007. Additionally, from 2016 to 2022 we wrote a limited number of homeowners policies in select areas of California. In 2022 we stopped writing new homeowners and condominium business in the states of California and Florida. As a result, since December 31, 2023, PIF has declined by approximately 5.0% and 21% in California and Florida, respectively. \n–\nWrite homeowners coverage, excluding in Florida, through our excess and surplus lines carrier, North Light Specialty Insurance Company (“North Light”), which can include earthquake coverage (other than fire following earthquakes) that is currently ceded via quota share reinsurance. \n•\nIncreased capacity in our brokerage platform for customers not offered an Allstate policy. As of December 31, 2024, Ivantage had $2.57 billion non-proprietary premiums under management.\n•\nCeded wind exposure related to insured property located in wind pool eligible areas in certain states.\n•\nGenerally require higher deductibles for tropical cyclone than all peril deductibles which are in place for a large portion of coastal insured properties.\n•\nInclude coverage for flood-related losses for auto comprehensive damage coverage since we have additional catastrophe exposure, beyond the property lines, for auto customers who have purchased comprehensive damage coverage. \n•\nProvide options of coverage for roof damage, including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age. In 2024, premiums written totaled $8.75 billion or 60.7% of homeowners premiums written.\nHurricanes \n We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to be major metropolitan centers along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States. The average premium on a property policy near these coasts is generally greater than in other areas. However, average premiums are often not considered commensurate with the inherent risk of loss. In addition, as explained in Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements, in various states Allstate is subject to assessments from assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting \nassociations providing insurance for wind related property losses.\nWe have addressed our risk of hurricane loss by, among other actions, purchasing reinsurance for specific states and on a countrywide basis for our personal lines property insurance in areas most exposed to hurricanes, limiting personal homeowners, landlord package policy and manufactured home new business writings in coastal areas in southern and eastern states, implementing tropical cyclone deductibles where appropriate, and not offering continuing coverage on certain policies in coastal counties in certain states. We continue to seek appropriate returns for the risks we write. This may require further actions, similar to those already taken, in geographies where we are not getting appropriate returns. However, we may maintain or opportunistically increase our presence in areas where adequate risk adjusted returns can be achieved.\nEarthquakes\n  We do not offer earthquake coverage in most states. We retain approximately 23,000 PIF with earthquake coverage, with the largest number of policies located in Kentucky, due to regulatory and other reasons. We purchase reinsurance in Kentucky and enter into arrangements in many states to make earthquake coverage available through our brokerage platform. \nWe continue to have exposure to earthquake risk on certain policies that do not specifically exclude coverage for earthquake losses, including our auto policies, and to homeowners insurance fire losses following earthquakes. Allstate homeowner policyholders in California are offered coverage for damage caused by an earthquake through the California Earthquake Authority (“CEA”), a privately financed, publicly managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage. Allstate is subject to assessments from the CEA under certain circumstances as explained in Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. While North Light writes property policies in California, which can include earthquake coverage, this coverage is 100% ceded via quota share reinsurance. \nFires following earthquakes\n  Under a standard homeowners policy we cover fire losses, including those caused by an earthquake. Actions taken related to our risk of loss from fires following earthquakes include restrictive underwriting guidelines in California for new business writings, purchasing reinsurance for Kentucky personal lines property risks, and purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance, excluding Florida.\nWildfires\n \n Actions taken related to managing our risk of loss from wildfires include purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance, new and renewal inspection programs to identify and remediate wildfire risk as well as leveraging contemporary underwriting tools in select areas. While these programs are designed to mitigate risk, the exposure to wildfires still exists. We continue to manage our\n \nexposure and seek appropriate returns for the risks we write. In addition, as explained in Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements, Allstate is subject to assessments from \n46      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nAllstate Protection  \nthe California FAIR Plan Association providing insurance for property losses. Refer to Note 1 for more information on the impact of the California wildfires.\nTo manage the exposure, we may implement further actions, similar to those already taken, in geographies where we are not achieving appropriate returns. However, we may maintain or opportunistically increase our presence in areas where adequate risk adjusted returns can be achieved.\nCatastrophe reinsurance \n The total cost of our property catastrophe reinsurance programs, excluding \nreinstatement premiums, during 2024 was $1.11 billion compared to $1.02 billion during 2023. Catastrophe placement premiums reduce net written and earned premium with approximately 80% of the reduction related to homeowners premium. A description of our current catastrophe reinsurance program appears in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.\nExpense ratio \nincreased 0.7 points in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in advertising costs, partially offset by higher earned premium growth relative to fixed costs.\nImpact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio\nFor the years ended December 31,\n($ in millions, except ratios)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023\n2023 vs 2022\nAmortization of DAC\n$\n6,676 \n$\n6,070 \n$\n5,570 \n$\n606 \n$\n500 \nAdvertising expense\n1,863 \n638 \n934 \n1,225 \n(296)\nOther costs and expenses, net of other revenue\n2,867 \n3,068 \n3,296 \n(201)\n(228)\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n206 \n235 \n240 \n(29)\n(5)\nRestructuring and related charges\n51 \n142 \n44 \n(91)\n98 \nTotal underwriting expenses\n$\n11,663\n \n$\n10,153\n \n$\n10,084\n \n$\n1,510\n \n$\n69\n \nPremiums earned\n$\n53,866\n \n$\n48,427\n \n$\n43,909\n \n$\n5,439\n \n$\n4,518\n \nExpense ratio\nAmortization of DAC\n12.4 \n12.5 \n12.7 \n(0.1)\n(0.2)\nAdvertising expense\n3.5 \n1.3 \n2.2 \n2.2 \n(0.9)\nOther costs and expenses, net of other revenue\n5.3 \n6.4 \n7.5 \n(1.1)\n(1.1)\nSubtotal\n21.2 \n20.2 \n22.4 \n1.0 \n(2.2)\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n0.3 \n0.5 \n0.5 \n(0.2)\n— \nRestructuring and related charges\n0.2 \n0.3 \n0.1 \n(0.1)\n0.2 \nTotal expense ratio\n21.7\n \n21.0\n \n23.0\n \n0.7\n \n(2.0)\nDeferred acquisition costs\n  We establish a DAC asset for costs that are related directly to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance policies, principally agent remuneration and premium taxes.

We may pursue settlement agreements including policy buybacks on direct excess commercial business when appropriate to improve the certainty of the liabilities. Settlement agreements are negotiated contracts between Allstate and third parties that generally set forth the rights and obligations of the parties, including terms of payment for claims.

The annual review resulted in unfavorable reserve reestimates totaling $58 million and $80 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The reserve reestimates are included as part of claims and claims expense. \nThe reserve reestimates in 2024 primarily related to new reported information for asbestos related claims and adverse developments within the other run-off lines. The reserve reestimates in 2023 primarily related to new reported information and defense costs for asbestos related claims and other run-off exposures and higher than expected environmental reported losses.\nWe believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws, regulations, and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g., claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. However, as we progress with the resolution of disputed claims in the courts and arbitrations and with negotiations and settlements, our reported losses may be more variable.\nReserves for asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims before and after the effects of reinsurance\n($ in millions) \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAsbestos claims\nGross reserves\n$\n1,124 \n$\n1,166 \nReinsurance \n(350)\n(362)\nNet reserves \n774 \n804 \nEnvironmental claims\nGross reserves\n320 \n331 \nReinsurance \n(61)\n(64)\nNet reserves \n259 \n267 \nOther run-off claims\nGross reserves\n439 \n445 \nReinsurance \n(58)\n(72)\nNet reserves\n381 \n373 \nTotal \nGross reserves\n \n1,883 \n1,942 \nReinsurance\n \n(469)\n(498)\nNet reserves\n$\n1,414\n \n$\n1,444\n \n48      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nRun-off Property-Liability\nReserves by type of exposure before and after the effects of reinsurance\n($ in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDirect excess commercial insurance \n    Gross reserves\n \n$\n1,082 \n$\n1,114 \n    Reinsurance \n(363)\n(382)\n    Net reserves\n719 \n732 \nAssumed reinsurance coverage\n    Gross reserves\n \n581 \n603 \n    Reinsurance \n(54)\n(54)\n    Net reserves\n527 \n549 \nDirect primary commercial insurance\n    Gross reserves \n133 \n140 \n    Reinsurance \n(51)\n(61)\n    Net reserves\n82 \n79 \nOther run-off business\n    Gross reserves\n— \n1 \n    Reinsurance\n— \n— \n    Net reserves\n— \n1 \nUnallocated loss adjustment expenses\n    Gross reserves\n87 \n84 \n    Reinsurance\n(1)\n(1)\n    Net reserves\n86 \n83 \nTotal\n    Gross reserves\n1,883 \n1,942 \n    Reinsurance\n(469)\n(498)\n    Net reserves\n$\n1,414\n \n$\n1,444\n \nPercentage of gross and ceded reserves by case and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCase\nIBNR\nCase\nIBNR\nDirect excess commercial insurance \nGross reserves\n (1)\n58 \n%\n42 \n%\n57 \n%\n43 \n%\nCeded \n(2)\n62 \n38 \n63 \n37 \nAssumed reinsurance coverage\nGross reserves\n \n34 \n66 \n32 \n68 \nCeded \n51 \n49 \n43 \n57 \nDirect primary commercial insurance\nGross reserves\n54 \n46 \n59 \n41 \nCeded\n87 \n13 \n83 \n17 \n(1)\nApproximately 65% and 68% of gross case reserves as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are subject to settlement agreements that define and limit our obligations.\n(2)\nApproximately 72% of ceded case reserves as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are subject to settlement agreements that define and limit our obligations.\nThe Allstate Corporation      49\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nRun-off Property-Liability\nGross payments from case reserves by type of exposure \n($ in millions)\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nDirect excess commercial insurance \nGross \n(1)\n$\n67 \n$\n72 \nCeded \n(2)\n(25)\n(27)\nAssumed reinsurance coverage\nGross\n \n45 \n45 \nCeded\n(2)\n(8)\nDirect primary commercial insurance\nGross\n6 \n7 \nCeded\n(2)\n— \n(1) \nIn 2024 and 2023, 87% and 85% of payments related to settlement agreements, respectively. \n(2) \nIn 2024 and 2023, 93% and 83% of payments related to settlement agreements, respectively.\nTotal net reserves as of December 31, 2024, included $723 million or 51% of estimated IBNR reserves compared to $762 million or 53% of estimated IBNR reserves as of December 31, 2023.\nTotal gross payments were $118 million and $124 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The facts and circumstances leading to reestimates of reserves relate to claim activity and updates to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Reestimates occur when actual losses differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates. For a description of our reserve process, see Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements.

As payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to vary over time.

The price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process. We utilize reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage capital, and to support the required statutory surplus and the insurance financial strength ratings of certain subsidiaries such as Castle Key Insurance Company (“CKIC”) and Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company (“ANJ”). We have also purchased reinsurance to mitigate exposures in our long-tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other run-off lines as well as our commercial lines. We also participate in various indemnification mechanisms, including state-based \nindustry pool or facility programs mandating participation by insurers offering certain coverage in their state and the federal government National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”).

We calculate our ceded reinsurance and indemnification estimates based on the terms of each applicable agreement, including an estimate of how IBNR losses will ultimately be ceded under the agreement. We also consider other limitations and coverage exclusions under our agreements. Accordingly, our estimate of recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as our estimate of reserves for claims and claims expense. We believe the recoverables are appropriately established; however, as our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts of our reinsurance recoverables, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is recorded, if needed. The establishment of reinsurance \nrecoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. Changes in estimates could result in additional changes to the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nIndemnification recoverables are considered collectible based on the industry pool and facility enabling legislation. The Company has not had any credit losses related to these programs, and we do not anticipate losses in the foreseeable future. We also have not experienced credit losses on our catastrophe reinsurance programs, which include highly rated reinsurers.\nThe allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to other reinsurance programs primarily related to our Run-off Property-Liability segment. The allowance was $63 million and $62 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Allstate Corporation      57\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n Reserve for\n \nProperty and Casualty Insurance\n \nClaims and Claims Expense\nThe allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other relevant factors. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we may become involved in coverage disputes with certain of our reinsurers that may ultimately result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against such reinsurers to determine the parties’ rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. We employ dedicated specialists to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. We also consider recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedents, and recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedents and reinsurers in seeking to maximize our reinsurance recoveries. \nAdverse developments in the insurance industry have led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. There has also been consolidation activity in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies. \nSee Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a description of the methodology utilized to calculate the allowance for reinsurance recoverables.\nFor further details related to our reinsurance and indemnification recoverables, see the Regulation section in Part I and Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.\nEffects of reinsurance ceded and indemnification programs on premiums earned and claims and claims expense\nFor the years ended December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAllstate Protection - Premiums\nIndemnification programs\nState-based industry pool or facility programs\nNCRF\n$\n441 \n$\n323 \n$\n300 \nMCCA\n26 \n29 \n18 \nPLIGA\n8 \n7 \n7 \nFHCF\n23 \n28 \n24 \nOther\n1 \n1 \n— \nFederal Government \n- \nNFIP \n(1)\n368 \n327 \n319 \nCatastrophe reinsurance\n1,088 \n995 \n764 \nOther reinsurance programs \n93 \n110 \n261 \nTotal Allstate Protection\n2,048\n \n1,820\n \n1,693\n \nRun-off Property-Liability\n— \n— \n— \nTotal Property-Liability\n2,048\n \n1,820\n \n1,693\n \nProtection Services\n162 \n169 \n176 \nTotal effect on premiums earned\n$\n2,210\n \n$\n1,989\n \n$\n1,869\n \nAllstate Protection - Claims\nIndemnification programs\nState-based industry pool or facility programs\nMCCA\n$\n180 \n$\n(185)\n$\n116 \nNCRF\n425 \n379 \n294 \nPLIGA\n60 \n14 \n(24)\nFHCF\n(1)\n(6)\n74 \nOther \n1 \n1 \n— \nFederal Government \n- \nNFIP \n(1)\n618 \n102 \n435 \nCatastrophe reinsurance\n \n198 \n32 \n298 \nOther reinsurance programs\n97 \n151 \n261 \nTotal Allstate Protection\n1,578\n \n488\n \n1,454\n \nRun-off Property-Liability\n2 \n29 \n50 \nTotal Property-Liability\n1,580\n \n517\n \n1,504\n \nProtection Services\n136 \n116 \n96 \nTotal effect on claims and claims expense\n$\n1,716\n \n$\n633\n \n$\n1,600\n \n(1)\nSee Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the National Flood Insurance Program.\nIn 2024, ceded premiums earned increased primarily due to NCRF and catastrophe reinsurance. In 2023, ceded premiums earned increased primarily due to catastrophe reinsurance.\nIn 2024, ceded claims and claims expenses increased $1.08 billion primarily due to an increase in the IBNR loss reserve for NFIP related to Hurricane Helene, catastrophe reinsurance, and a prior year \nreduction in gross reserves for Michigan Personal Injury Protection (“PIP”) coverage. In 2023, ceded claims and claims expenses decreased $967 million primarily due to lower amounts related to NFIP, and a reduction in gross reserves for Michigan PIP coverage.

The MCCA does not require member companies to report ultimate case reserves.\nPending MCCA claims differ from most personal lines insurance pending claims as other personal lines policies incurred claims settle in shorter periods due to having a coverage limit. MCCA claims can be outstanding for a claimant’s lifetime, as there is no contractual limitation on any policy effective July 1, 2020 or prior, and on policies that selected the unlimited PIP benefits option on or after July 2, 2020. Many of these injuries are catastrophic in nature, resulting in serious permanent disabilities that require attendant and residential care for periods that may span decades. A significant portion of the ultimate incurred claim reserves and the recoverables can be attributed to a small number of catastrophic claims that occurred more than five years ago and continue to pay lifetime benefits.\n As of December 31, 2024, approximately 90% of our 1,300 catastrophic claims that are eligible for reimbursement by the MCCA occurred more than 5 years ago and continue to incur costs. There are 63 claims with reserves in excess of $15 million as of December 31, 2024, which comprise approximately 24% of the gross ending reserves in the table above.

Investment portfolios are held for Property-Liability, Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits and Corporate and Other operations. While taking into consideration the investment portfolio in aggregate, management of the underlying portfolios is significantly influenced by the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability profile. For each business, we identify a strategic asset allocation which considers both the nature of the liabilities and the risk and return characteristics of the various asset classes in which we invest. This allocation is informed by our long-term business and market expectations, as well as other considerations such as risk appetite, portfolio diversification, duration, desired liquidity and capital. Within appropriate ranges relative to strategic allocations, tactical allocations are made in consideration of prevailing and potential future market conditions. We manage risks that involve uncertainty related to interest rates, inflation, credit spreads, equity returns and currency exchange rates.\nThe Property-Liability portfolio emphasizes protection of principal and consistent income generation within a total return framework. This approach has produced competitive returns over the long term and is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. Products with lower liquidity and capital needs, such as auto insurance and run-off lines, create capacity to invest in less liquid higher yielding fixed income securities, performance-based investments such as limited partnerships and equity securities. Products with higher liquidity needs, such as homeowners insurance, are invested primarily in high quality liquid fixed income securities.\nThe Protection Services portfolio is focused on protection of principal and consistent income generation within a total return framework. The portfolio is largely comprised of fixed income securities with a lesser allocation to equity securities and short-term investments.\nThe Allstate Health and Benefits portfolio is focused on protection of principal and consistent income generation within a total return framework. The portfolio is largely comprised of fixed income securities with a small allocation to short-term investments.\nThe Corporate and Other portfolio is primarily focused on liquidity needs and capital preservation within a total return framework. The portfolio is largely comprised of high-quality liquid fixed income securities and short-term investments with a lower allocation to performance-based and equity investments.\nWe utilize two primary strategies to manage risks and returns and to position our portfolio to take \nadvantage of market opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects. As strategies and market conditions evolve, the asset allocation may change.\nMarket-based\n \nstrategy seeks to deliver predictable earnings aligned to business needs and provide flexibility to adjust investment risk profile based on enterprise objectives and market opportunities primarily through public and private fixed income investments and public equity securities.\nPerformance-based\n \nstrategy seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk. Consequently, return patterns can be more volatile than the market-based portfolio. Returns are impacted by a variety of factors including general macroeconomic and public market conditions as public benchmarks are often used in the valuation of underlying investments. Variability in earnings will also result from the performance of the underlying assets or business and the timing of sales of those investments. Earnings from the sales of investments may be recorded as net investment income or net gains and losses on investments and derivatives. The portfolio, which primarily includes private equity (including infrastructure investments) and real estate with a majority being limited partnerships, is diversified across a number of characteristics, including managers or partners, vintage years, investment strategies, geographies (including international) and industry sectors or property types. These investments are generally illiquid in nature, often require specialized expertise, typically involve a third-party manager, and enhance returns and income through transformation at the company or property level. A portion of these investments seek returns in markets or asset classes that are dislocated or special situations, primarily in private markets.\nInvestments outlook \nOur focus is on the following priorities:\n•\nEnhance investment portfolio returns through use of a dynamic capital allocation framework and focus on tax efficiency.\n•\nLeverage our broad capabilities to manage the portfolio to earn higher risk-adjusted returns on capital.\n•\nInvest for the specific needs and characteristics of Allstate’s businesses, including its corresponding liability profile.\nWe utilize our integrated enterprise risk and return management framework to determine the amount of investment risk we are willing to accept. Beginning in 2023, we extended the fixed income portfolio duration as the sustained higher market yields provided an opportunity to increase risk-adjusted returns. In 2024, we increased public equity securities by $2.05 billion primarily funded through the sale of investment grade corporate bonds and short-term investments. \n62      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nInvestments\nPortfolio composition and strategy by reporting segment \n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024\n($ in millions)\nProperty-Liability\nProtection Services\nAllstate Health and Benefits\n \nCorporate \nand Other\nTotal\nFixed income securities \n(2)\n$\n49,203 \n$\n1,868 \n$\n362 \n$\n1,314 \n$\n52,747 \nEquity securities \n(3)\n3,830 \n229 \n— \n404 \n4,463 \nMortgage loans, net\n784 \n— \n— \n— \n784 \nLimited partnership interests\n9,244 \n— \n— \n11 \n9,255 \nShort-term investments \n(4)\n3,786 \n131 \n17 \n603 \n4,537 \nOther investments, net\n824 \n— \n— \n— \n824 \nTotal\n$\n67,671\n \n$\n2,228\n \n$\n379\n \n$\n2,332\n \n$\n72,610\n \nPercentage to total \n93.2\n \n%\n3.1\n \n%\n0.5\n \n%\n3.2\n \n%\n100.0\n \n%\nMarket-based\n$\n57,489 \n$\n2,228 \n$\n379 \n$\n2,054 \n$\n62,150 \nPerformance-based\n10,182 \n— \n— \n278 \n10,460 \nTotal\n$\n67,671\n \n$\n2,228\n \n$\n379\n \n$\n2,332\n \n$\n72,610\n \n(1)\nBalances reflect the elimination of related party investments between segments.\n(2)\nFixed income securities are carried at fair value.

We increased public equity securities by $2.05 billion in 2024. \nThe Allstate Corporation      63\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nInvestments\nFixed income securities\nFixed income securities by type\nFair value as of December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nU.S. government and agencies\n$\n11,108 \n$\n8,619 \nMunicipal\n8,842 \n6,006 \nCorporate\n30,192 \n31,205 \nForeign government\n1,364 \n1,290 \nAsset-backed securities (“ABS”)\n1,241 \n1,745 \nTotal fixed income securities\n$\n52,747\n \n$\n48,865\n \nFixed income securities are rated by third-party credit rating agencies or are internally rated. The Securities Valuation Office (“SVO”) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) evaluates the fixed income securities of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes. The NAIC assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories defined as “NAIC designations”. In general, securities with NAIC designations of 1 and 2 are considered investment grade and securities with NAIC designations of 3 through 6 are considered below investment grade. The rating is either received from the SVO based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations provider list, including Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”), Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) or a comparable internal rating.\nAs a result of time lags between the funding of investments, the finalization of legal documents, and the completion of the SVO filing process, the portfolio includes certain securities that have not yet been designated by the SVO as of each balance sheet date and the categorization of these securities is based on the expected ratings indicated by internal analysis\n.\nAs of December 31, 2024, 91.3% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade. Credit ratings below these designations are considered lower credit quality or below investment grade, which includes high yield bonds. \nMarket prices for certain securities may have credit spreads which imply higher or lower credit quality than the current third-party rating. Our initial investment decisions and ongoing monitoring procedures for fixed income securities are based on a due diligence process which includes, but is not limited to, an assessment of the credit quality, sector, structure and liquidity risks of each issuer.\nFixed income portfolio monitoring is a\n \ncomprehensive process to identify and evaluate each fixed income security that may require a credit loss allowance. The process includes a quarterly review of all securities to identify instances where the fair value of a security compared to its amortized cost is below internally established thresholds. For further detail on our fixed income portfolio monitoring process, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.\n64      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nInvestments\nThe following table presents total fixed income securities by the applicable NAIC designation and comparable S&P rating.\nFair value and unrealized net capital gains (losses) for fixed income securities by credit rating\nDecember 31, 2024\nNAIC 1\nNAIC 2\nNAIC 3\nA and above\nBBB\nBB\n($ in millions)\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized gain (loss)\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized gain (loss)\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized gain (loss)\nU.S. government and agencies\n$\n11,108 \n$\n(315)\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \nMunicipal\n8,709 \n(143)\n131 \n(2)\n— \n— \nCorporate\nPublic\n6,089 \n(29)\n14,529 \n(299)\n525 \n(8)\nPrivately placed\n1,769 \n(22)\n3,315 \n(56)\n2,427 \n(19)\nTotal corporate\n7,858\n \n(51)\n17,844\n \n(355)\n2,952\n \n(27)\nForeign government\n1,364 \n12 \n— \n— \n— \n— \nABS\n1,138 \n1 \n22 \n— \n27 \n— \nTotal fixed income securities\n$\n30,177\n \n$\n(496)\n$\n17,997\n \n$\n(357)\n$\n2,979\n \n$\n(27)\nNAIC 4\nNAIC 5-6\nTotal\nB\nCCC and lower\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized gain (loss)\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized gain (loss)\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized gain (loss)\nU.S. government and agencies\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n11,108 \n$\n(315)\nMunicipal\n— \n— \n2 \n2 \n8,842 \n(143)\nCorporate\nPublic\n84 \n(1)\n6 \n— \n21,233 \n(337)\nPrivately placed\n1,337 \n(2)\n111 \n(2)\n8,959 \n(101)\nTotal corporate\n1,421\n \n(3)\n117\n \n(2)\n30,192\n \n(438)\nForeign government\n— \n— \n— \n— \n1,364 \n12 \nABS\n1 \n— \n53 \n14 \n1,241 \n15 \nTotal fixed income securities\n$\n1,422\n \n$\n(3)\n$\n172\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n52,747\n \n$\n(869)\nMunicipal bonds\n, including tax-exempt and taxable securities, include general obligations of state and local issuers and revenue bonds.\nOur practice for acquiring and monitoring municipal bonds is predominantly based on the underlying credit quality of the primary obligor. We currently rely on the primary obligor to pay all contractual cash flows and are not relying on bond insurers for payments.\nCorporate bonds\n include publicly traded and privately placed securities. Privately placed securities primarily consist of corporate issued senior debt securities that are negotiated with the borrower or are issued by entities in unregistered form under SEC Rule 144A which allows purchasers to more easily resell these securities under certain conditions.\nOur $8.96 billion portfolio of privately placed securities, primarily 144A bonds, is diversified by issuer, industry sector and country. The portfolio is made up of 544 issuers. Privately placed corporate obligations may contain structural security features such as financial covenants and call protections that provide investors greater protection against credit deterioration, reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates than those typically found in publicly registered debt securities. Additionally, investments in these securities are made after fundamental analysis of issuers and sectors along with macro and asset class views. Ongoing monitoring includes continuous assessment of \noperating performance and financial position. Every issue not rated by an independent rating agency is internally rated with a formal rating affirmation at least once a year. $91 million of the portfolio is internally rated as of December 31, 2024. Liquidity of securities issued by public entities in unregistered form is similar to public debt markets.\nOur corporate bond portfolio includes $4.49 billion of below investment grade bonds, $3.88 billion of which are privately placed, primarily 144A bonds. These securities are diversified by issuer and industry sector. The below investment grade corporate bonds portfolio is made up of 356 issuers. We employ fundamental analyses of issuers and sectors along with macro and asset class views to identify investment opportunities. This results in a portfolio with broad exposure to the high yield market with an emphasis on idiosyncratic positions reflective of our views of market conditions and opportunities.\nForeign government securities\n consist of Canadian governmental and provincial securities (all of which are held by our Canadian companies).\nABS\n are structured securities that are primarily collateralized by consumer or corporate borrowings and residential and commercial real estate loans. The cash flows from the underlying collateral paid to the securitization trust are generally applied in a pre-determined order and are designed so that each \nThe Allstate Corporation      65\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nInvestments\nsecurity issued by the trust, typically referred to as a “class”, qualifies for a specific original rating.\nABS includes collateralized debt obligations, consumer and other ABS. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the underlying collateral. Many of the securities in the ABS portfolio have credit enhancement with features such as overcollateralization, subordinated structures, reserve funds, guarantees or insurance. ABS also includes\n \nresidential mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. \nThe payment priority and class subordination included in these securities serves as credit enhancement for holders of the senior or top portions of the structures. These securities continue to retain the payment priority features that existed at the origination of the securitization trust. Other forms of credit enhancement may include structural features embedded in the securitization trust, such as overcollateralization, excess spread and bond insurance. The underlying collateral may contain fixed interest rates, variable interest rates (such as adjustable-rate mortgages), or both fixed and variable rate features.\nEquity securities\n of $4.46 billion primarily include common stocks, exchange traded and mutual funds, non-redeemable preferred stocks and real estate investment trust (“REIT”) equity investments. Certain exchange traded and mutual funds have fixed income securities as their underlying investments.\nMortgage loans\n of $784 million comprise loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate of $723 million and residential mortgage loans of $61 million. Key considerations used to manage our exposure include property type and geographic diversification. For further detail on our mortgage loan portfolio, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.\nLimited partnership interests\n include $7.73 billion of interests in private equity funds, $1.24 billion of interests in real estate funds and $285 million of interests in other funds as of December 31, 2024.

Adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in fiscal policy, inflation, the economic climate, the liquidity of a market or market segment, insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or participants or changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness or risk tolerance. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices, and to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange rates. We also have direct and indirect exposure to commodity price changes through our diversified investments in agriculture, infrastructure and energy primarily held in limited partnership interests and consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges: \n1)\nRebalance existing asset or liability portfolios\n2)\nChange the type of investments purchased in the future \n3)\nUse derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased\nOverview\n  In formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn attractive risk-adjusted returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive prices to customers while contributing to stable profits and long-term capital growth. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are informed by underlying risks. Investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and controls over risk management activities. Subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors and which specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity, surplus, product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary. Executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through the subsidiaries’ boards of directors and legal entity investment committees. The Enterprise Risk and Return Council (“ERRC”) oversees the aggregate risk of Allstate and its subsidiaries. Working in conjunction with the board or the investment committee of each subsidiary, as applicable, the ERRC evaluates the risk tolerance of each subsidiary and determines the aggregate risk tolerance of the enterprise.\nWe use widely accepted quantitative and qualitative approaches to measure, monitor and manage market risk. We evaluate our market risk exposure using multiple measures including but not limited to:\n•\n \nDuration,\n a measure of the price sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates\n•\n \n \nValue-at-risk,\n a statistical estimate that the change in fair value of a portfolio will exceed a certain amount over a given time horizon, at a specified probability\n•\n \nScenario analysis,\n an estimate of the potential changes in the fair value of a portfolio that could occur under hypothetical market conditions defined by changes to multiple market risk factors: interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices or currency exchange rates\n•  \nSensitivity analysis,\n an estimate of the potential changes in the fair value of a portfolio that could occur using hypothetical shocks to a market risk factor  \nThe selection of measures used in our sensitivity analysis should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event\n In general, we establish investment portfolio asset allocation and market risk limits based upon a combination of these measures. The asset allocation limits place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. Comprehensive day-to-day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies. Although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments may differ between our products and therefore affect investment decisions and risk parameters. Our actual experience may differ from the results of the sensitivity measurements provided below.\nInterest rate risk\n is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in risk-free interest rates. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest-sensitive assets. Changes in interest rates can have favorable and unfavorable effects on our results. For example, increases in rates can improve investment income, but decrease the fair value of our fixed income securities portfolio which may result in sales of assets at losses. Decreases in rates could increase the fair value of our fixed income securities portfolio while decreasing future investment income due to reinvestment at lower market yields and accelerated pay-downs and prepayments of certain investments.\nFor our issued debt, we monitor market interest rates and evaluate refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach. To mitigate this risk, we ladder the maturity dates of our debt. For our issued noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, we monitor market dividend rates and evaluate opportunities to redeem or refinance on or after specified dates. For further detail regarding our debt and our preferred stock, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements and the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of this Item.\nThe Allstate Corporation      71\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nMarket Risk\nOur assessment of interest rate risk reflects the effect of changing risk-free interest rates on interest-sensitive assets, including investments with callable or prepayable features. As of December 31, 2024, the fixed income portfolio duration, including the effects of interest rate derivatives, was 5.3 compared to 4.8 as of December 31, 2023.\nChange in fair value of interest-sensitive assets \n(1)\nAs of December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n-100 bps interest rate change\n$\n2,996 \n$\n2,530 \n+100 bps interest rate change\n(2,765)\n(2,314)\n+200 bps interest rate change\n(5,298)\n(4,410)\n(1)\nIncludes the effects of interest rate derivatives. \nCredit spread risk\n is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads (“spreads”). A credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities and loans above the risk-free rate that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit, liquidity or prepayment risks. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in spread-sensitive fixed income assets.\nOur assessment of credit spread risk reflects the effect of changing credit spreads on spread-sensitive assets, including investments with callable or prepayable features. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the spread duration\n(1)\n was 4.7.\nChange in fair value of spread-sensitive assets\n (1)\nAs of December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n+100 bps credit spread change\n$\n(2,118)\n$\n(1,898)\n(1)\nIncludes the effects of credit derivatives.\nEquity price risk\n is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the levels of equity indices, the value of individual stocks, or private market valuations related to our limited partnership interests.\nWe periodically use derivatives to reduce equity price risk or to adjust our equity risk profile. Equity derivatives may also be utilized to replicate cash market positions to increase equity exposure. \nEquity investments\n(1)\n  As of December 31, 2024, we held $4.00 billion in equity investments that comprise equity securities, excluding those with fixed income securities as their underlying investments, and including limited partnership interests where the underlying assets are predominately public equity securities, compared to $1.52 billion as of December 31, 2023. \nChange in fair value of equity investments\n (1)\nAs of December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n-10% change in equity valuations\n$\n(399)\n$\n(127)\n(1)\nIncludes the effects of equity derivatives.\nLimited partnership interests\n \n As of December 31, 2024, we held $8.95 billion in limited partnership interests, excluding those limited partnership interests where the underlying assets are predominately public equity securities, compared to $8.24 billion as of December 31, 2023. These illiquid investments are primarily comprised of private equity and real estate funds, with valuation changes typically reflecting the idiosyncratic performance of the underlying asset.\nChange in fair value of limited partnership \ninterests\nAs of December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n-10% change in private market valuations\n$\n(895)\n$\n(824)\nFor limited partnership interests, quarterly changes in fair values may not be highly correlated to equity indices in the short term and changes in value of these investments are generally recognized on a three-month delay due to the availability of the related investee financial statements. \nForeign currency exchange rate risk\n is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments, including common stocks, limited partnership interests, and our Canada, Northern Ireland, Europe and India operations. We use foreign currency derivative contracts to partially offset this risk.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $3.74 billion in foreign currency denominated investments, including the effects of foreign currency derivative contracts, and $1.29 billion net investment in our foreign subsidiaries, primarily related to our Canada operations. These amounts were $3.56 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. \nChange in fair value of foreign currency denominated investments\nAs of December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n–10% change in foreign currency exchange rates\n (1)\n$\n(374)\n$\n(356)\n–10% change in net investments in foreign subsidiaries \n(2)\n(129)\n(125)\n(1)\nIncludes the effects of foreign currency derivative contracts and excludes the offset from liabilities in foreign currencies. \n(2)\nIncludes the effects of foreign currency derivative contracts and the offset from liabilities in foreign currencies.\n72      www.allstate.com\n \n2024 Form 10-K  \nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nCapital Resources and Liquidity \nCapital resources \nconsist of shareholders’ equity and debt, representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes. \nCapital resources\nAs of December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPreferred stock, common stock, treasury stock, retained income and other shareholders’ equity items\n$\n22,331 \n$\n18,470 \n$\n19,880 \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”)\n(889)\n(700)\n(2,392)\nTotal Allstate shareholders’ equity\n21,442\n \n17,770\n \n17,488\n \nDebt\n8,085 \n7,942 \n7,964 \nTotal capital resources\n$\n29,527\n \n$\n25,712\n \n$\n25,452\n \nRatio of debt to Allstate shareholders’ equity\n37.7 \n%\n44.7 \n%\n45.5 \n%\nRatio of debt to capital resources\n27.4 \n%\n30.9 \n%\n31.3 \n%\nAllstate shareholders’ equity\n increased in 2024, primarily due to net income, partially offset by dividends to shareholders.

Allstate shareholders’ equity increased in 2023, primarily due to lower unrealized net capital losses on investments, partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders, common share repurchases and a net loss. In 2023, we paid dividends of $925 million and $107 million related to our common and preferred shares, respectively. \nRepayment of debt  \nOn May 15, 2024, the Company repaid, at maturity, $350 million of 6.75% Senior Notes.\nIssuance of debt  \nOn June 24, 2024, the Company issued $500 million of 5.05% Senior Notes due 2029.

The Senior Notes are redeemable at any time at the applicable redemption price prior to the maturity date. The net proceeds of this issuance were used for general corporate purposes.\nCommon share repurchases  \nOn March 31, 2024, our $5.00 billion share repurchase authorization expired.\nSince 1995, we have acquired 793 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $43.23 billion, primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs. We have reissued 159 million common shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation and the 2001 redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Since 1995, total common shares outstanding has decreased by 634 million shares or 70.5%, primarily due to our repurchase programs.\nCommon shareholder dividends\n  On January 2, 2024, April 1, 2024, July 1, 2024 and October 1, 2024, we paid a common shareholder dividend of $0.89, $0.92, $0.92 and $0.92, respectively.

Statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity, operating leverage and premium growth capacity, and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings.\nThe property and casualty business is comprised of 59 insurance companies as of December 31, 2024, each of which has individual company dividend limitations. As of December 31, 2024, total statutory surplus is $18.64 billion compared to $14.56 billion as of December 31, 2023. Property and casualty subsidiaries surplus was $18.24 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared to $14.25 billion as of December 31, 2023. Our three life, accident and health insurance subsidiaries had surplus of $392 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $310 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe NAIC has developed financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by state insurance regulators. The NAIC analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios, each with defined “usual ranges”. Additional regulatory scrutiny may occur if a company’s ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios.\n74      www.allstate.com\n \n2024 Form 10-K  \nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nLiquidity sources and uses\n \nOur potential sources and uses of funds principally include the following activities below.\nActivities for potential sources of funds\nProperty-\nLiability\nProtection Services\nAllstate Health and Benefits\nCorporate\nand Other\nReceipt of insurance premiums\nü\nü\nü\nRecurring service fees\nü\nü\nü\nContractholder fund deposits\nü\nReinsurance and indemnification program recoveries\nü\nü\nü\nReceipts of principal, interest and dividends on investments\nü\nü\nü\nü\nSales of investments\nü\nü\nü\nü\nFunds from securities lending, commercial paper and line of credit agreements\nü\nü\nIntercompany loans\nü\nü\nü\nü\nCapital contributions from parent \n(1)\nü\nü\nü\nü\nDividends or return of capital from subsidiaries\nü\nü\nü\nü\nTax refunds/settlements\nü\nü\nü\nü\nFunds from periodic issuance of additional securities\nü\nReceipt of intercompany settlements related to employee benefit plans\nü\nFunds from dispositions\nü\n(1)\nCapital support is generally at management’s discretion unless contractual commitments are in place. \nActivities for potential uses of funds\nProperty-\nLiability\nProtection Services\nAllstate Health and Benefits\nCorporate\nand Other\nPayment of claims and related expenses\nü\nü\nPayment of contract benefits, surrenders and withdrawals\nü\nReinsurance cessions and indemnification program payments\nü\nü\nü\nOperating costs and expenses\nü\nü\nü\nü\nPurchase of investments\nü\nü\nü\nü\nRepayment of securities lending, commercial paper and line of credit agreements\nü\nü\nPayment or repayment of intercompany loans\nü\nü\nü\nü\nCapital contributions to subsidiaries\nü\nü\nü\nü\nDividends or return of capital to shareholders/parent company\nü\nü\nü\nü\nTax payments/settlements\nü\nü\nü\nü\nCommon share repurchases\nü\nDebt service expenses and repayment\nü\nPayments related to employee benefit plans\nü\nü\nü\nü\nPayments for acquisitions\nü\nü\nü\nü\nContractual obligations and commitments\n \n We have short-term and long-term contractual obligations and commitments. We manage our short-term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short-term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business, including utilizing potential sources of liquidity. Long-term obligations include known contractual commitments that require cash needs beyond 12 months.\nShort-term contractual obligations \nare typically settled with cash or short-term investments and \noperating cash flows. Most of these obligations are paid within one year. These include unconditional purchase obligations, other liabilities and accrued expenses, including liabilities for collateral and operating leases, and net unrecognized tax benefits.\nWe actively manage our financial position and liquidity levels in light of changing market, economic, and business conditions. Liquidity is managed at both the entity and enterprise level across the Company and is assessed on both base and stressed level liquidity needs. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet these needs. Additionally, we have existing \nThe Allstate Corporation      75\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nintercompany agreements in place that facilitate liquidity management across the Company to enhance flexibility. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we held $20.05 billion of cash, U.S. government and agencies fixed income securities, public equity securities and short-term investments, which we would expect to be able to liquidate within one week. In addition, we regularly estimate how much of the total portfolio, which includes high quality corporate fixed income and municipal holdings, can be reasonably liquidated within one quarter. These estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty associated with evolving market conditions. As of December 31, 2024, cash and estimated liquidity available within one quarter, under normal market conditions and at current market prices, was $28.20 billion.\nCertain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a liquidity decrease in securities markets, dramatic changes in security pricing, a cybersecurity breach, a downgrade in our senior long-term debt ratings to non-investment grade status, or a downgrade in AIC’s financial strength ratings. The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities; therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities.\nThe Corporation is party to an Amended and Restated Intercompany Liquidity Agreement (“Liquidity Agreement”) with certain subsidiaries, which includes, but is not limited to AIC. The Liquidity Agreement allows for short-term advances of funds to be made between parties for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Liquidity Agreement does not establish a commitment to advance funds on the part of any party. AIC serves as a lender and borrower, certain other subsidiaries serve only as borrowers, and the Corporation serves only as a lender. The maximum amount of potential funding under each of these agreements is $1.00 billion.\nIn addition to the Liquidity Agreement, the Corporation also has an intercompany loan agreement with certain of its subsidiaries, which includes, but is not limited to, AIC. The amount of intercompany loans available to the Corporation’s subsidiaries is at the discretion of the Corporation. The maximum amount of loans the Corporation will have outstanding to all its eligible subsidiaries at any given point in time is limited to $1.00 billion. The Corporation may use commercial paper borrowings, bank lines of credit and securities lending to fund intercompany borrowings.\nParent company capital capacity\n  At the parent holding company level, we have deployable assets totaling $3.28 billion as of December 31, 2024, primarily comprised of cash and short-term, fixed income and equity securities that are generally saleable within one quarter. The earnings capacity of the operating subsidiaries is the primary source of capital generation for the Corporation.\nThe payment of dividends by AIC to The Allstate Corporation is limited by Illinois insurance law to formula amounts based on statutory net income and statutory surplus, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. The maximum amount of dividends that AIC will be able to pay, without prior Illinois Department of Insurance approval, at a given point in time in 2025, based on the greater of 2024 statutory net income or 10% of actual 2024 statutory surplus. This is estimated to be $3.95 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. No dividends were paid in 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the maximum amount of dividends allowed to be paid by AIC was $1.20 billion. Notification and approval of intercompany lending activities are also required by the Illinois Department of Insurance for those transactions that exceed formula amounts based on statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus.\nThese holding company assets and subsidiary dividends provide funds for the parent company’s fixed charges and other corporate purposes. \nThere were intercompany capital transactions in 2024, 2023 and 2022 between the following companies: AIC, Allstate Insurance Holdings, LLC (“AIH”), the Corporation, Allstate Non-Insurance Holdings, Inc.

In 2024, we did not defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures.\nAdditional resources to support liquidity are as follows:\n•\nThe Corporation and AIC have access to a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility that is available for short-term liquidity requirements. The maturity date of this facility is November 2027. The facility is fully subscribed among 11 lenders with the largest commitment being $95 million. The commitments of the lenders are several and \n76      www.allstate.com\n \n2024 Form 10-K  \nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nno lender is responsible for any other lender’s commitment if such lender fails to make a loan under the facility. This facility contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional $500 million of borrowing, subject to the lenders’ commitment. This facility has a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a 37.5% debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the agreement. This ratio was 20.8% as of December 31, 2024. Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior unsecured, unguaranteed long-term debt. There were no borrowings under the credit facility during 2024.\n•\nTo cover short-term cash needs, the Corporation has access to a commercial paper facility with a borrowing capacity limited to any undrawn credit facility balance up to $750 million. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the credit facility and the commercial paper program cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility.\n•\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were no balances outstanding for the credit facility or the commercial paper facility and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was $750 million under each facility.\n•\nThe Corporation has access to a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that was filed on April 30, 2024 and expires in 2027. We can use this shelf registration to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock (including 635 million shares of treasury stock as of December 31, 2024), preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. The specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements.\nLong-term contractual obligations\nDefined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans (“OPEB”)  \nPension plan obligations within the next 12 months represent our planned contributions to certain unfunded non-qualified plans where the benefit obligation exceeds the assets. Obligations beyond 12 months are projected based on the average remaining service period using the current underfunded status of the plans. The OPEB plans’ obligations are estimated based on the expected benefits to be paid. See Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nReserves for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense\n represent estimated amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been IBNR as of the balance sheet date.\n E\nstimated timing of payments for reserves is based on our historical experience and our \nexpectation of future payment patterns. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts that are our best estimates. See Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A for further information.\nReserve for future policy benefits and contractholder funds \n We estimate the present value of cash payments to be made to contractholders and policyholders. We are currently making payments for contracts where the timing of a portion or all of the payments has been determined by the contract. Contracts such as voluntary accident and health insurance, interest-sensitive life and traditional life insurance involve payment obligations where a portion or all of the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. We have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, estimated additional deposits for interest-sensitive life contracts, and renewal premiums for life policies, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. See Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for further information. \nContractual commitments\n \nrepresent investment commitments such as private placements, limited partnership interests and other loans. Limited partnership interests are typically funded over the commitment period, which is shorter than the contractual expiration date of the partnership and as a result, the actual timing of the funding may vary.\nWe have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. All material intercompany transactions have been appropriately eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required.\nFor a more detailed discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Allstate Corporation      77\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nEnterprise Risk and Return Management\nEnterprise Risk and Return Management\nAllstate creates shareholder value while serving customers through a comprehensive risk and return framework. These risks are discussed in more detail in the Risk Factors section of this document.\nWe regularly identify, measure, manage, monitor and report all significant risks and assess likely returns. Major categories of enterprise risk are strategic, insurance, investment, financial, operational and culture.\nAllstate manages these risks through an Enterprise Risk and Return Management (“ERRM”) framework that includes governance, processes, culture, and activities that are performed on an integrated, enterprise-wide basis, following our risk and return principles. Our legal and capital structures are designed to manage capital and solvency on a legal entity basis. Our risk-return \nprinciples define how we operate and guide risk and return decision-making. These principles state that our priority is to maintain a strong foundation by maintaining capital strength, solvency and liquidity, complying with laws, acting with integrity and protecting customers and proprietary information, assets and technology. We strive to build strategic value by continually investing in enhancing our strategic position, creating flexibility to adapt our business model in a changing world and differentiating through innovation. We optimize risk and return through profitable growth, recognizing the value of customer relationships in operating and strategic decisions and developing new business offerings and investment opportunities while managing risk concentrations.\nGovernance \n \nERRM governance includes board oversight, an executive management committee, and enterprise and market-facing business chief risk officers.\n•\nThe Allstate Corporation Board of Directors (“Allstate Board”) has overall responsibility for oversight of management’s design and implementation of Allstate’s ERRM framework, supported by the Audit Committee (“AC”) and the Risk and Return Committee (“RRC”).\n•\nThe RRC of the Allstate Board oversees effectiveness of the ERRM program, governance structure and risk-related decision-making, while focusing on the Company’s aggregate risk profile.\n•\nThe AC oversees the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, as well as management’s risk and control and cybersecurity program, and assists the Board in fulfilling certain oversight responsibilities as listed in the committee’s charter.\n78      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K \nEnterprise Risk and Return Management \n•\nThe ERRC directs ERRM activities by establishing risk and return targets, determining economic capital levels and monitoring integrated strategies and actions from an enterprise risk and return perspective. The ERRC consists of Allstate’s chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief risk officer, chief legal officer and other senior leaders.\n•\nOther key committees work with the ERRC to direct ERRM activities, including the Operational Risk and Return Council, the Information Security Council, the Internal Compliance and Control Committee, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Steering Committee, liability governance committees, and investment committees.\nKey risks are assessed and reported through comprehensive ERRM reports prepared for senior management and the RRC. These risk summary reports communicate the alignment of Allstate’s risk profile with risk and return principles, while providing a perspective on risk positioning. Discussion promotes active engagement with management and the RRC. Internal controls over key risks are managed and reported to senior management and the Audit Committee of the Company through a semi-annual risk control dashboard. Annually, we review risks related to the strategic plan, operating plan and incentive compensation programs with the Allstate Board.\nFramework \n \nWe apply risk and return principles using an integrated ERRM framework that focuses on assessment, transparency and dialogue, which provides a comprehensive view of risks and is used by senior management and business managers to drive risk-return based decisions. We continually validate and improve our ERRM practices by benchmarking and obtaining external perspectives.\nManagement and the ERRC utilize internal and external perspectives to determine an appropriate level of target economic capital. Internal perspectives include enterprise solvency and volatility assessments, review of key operating and model assumptions, and management judgment. Sensitivity testing and scenario analysis are used to gauge the robustness of Allstate’s risk, capital and liquidity positions. Analysis of extremely low-frequency scenarios is also used to assess the sufficiency of capital and contingency options under worst-case outcomes, including unlikely but impactful single events, as well as sequences of multiple tail events. External considerations include NAIC risk-based capital as well as S&P’s, Moody’s, and A.M. Best’s capital adequacy measurements. Our economic capital reflects management’s view of the aggregate level of capital necessary to satisfy stakeholder interests, manage Allstate’s risk profile and maintain financial strength. The impact of strategic initiatives on enterprise risk is evaluated through this context.\nThe NAIC has adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (“ORSA Model Act”), which has been enacted by our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states. The ORSA Model Act requires that insurers maintain a risk management \nframework and conduct an internal own risk and solvency assessment of the insurer’s material risks in normal and stressed environments. Results of the assessment are filed annually. \nAllstate’s risk appetite is measured through our economic capital framework, which establishes the amount of capital needed to support the current and projected enterprise risk profile and provides a methodology for measuring risk-adjusted returns and optimizing capital allocations. The enterprise risk appetite is cascaded into individual risk limits which set boundaries on the amount of risk we are willing to accept from one specific risk category before escalating for further management discussion and action. Risk limits are established based upon expected returns, volatility, potential tail losses and impact on the enterprise portfolio. To effectively operate within risk limits and for risk-return optimization, Allstate establishes risk limits and capital targets specific to each business unit. Allstate’s risk management strategies adapt to changes in business and market environments.\nProcess \n \nWe establish a basis for transparency and dialogue across the enterprise and for continuous learning by embedding our risk and return management culture of identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks within the organization. Allstate designs business and enterprise strategies that seek to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. Risks are managed at both the legal entity and enterprise level.\nMany risk drivers impact more than one of the key risk categories. Examples include risks related to inflation and the impacts of climate change, which span Allstate’s major risk categories. Such risks are managed within Allstate’s integrated ERRM framework and the processes listed below, but the overall strategy is coordinated at the enterprise level, and holistic governance is provided by cross-functional committees such as the ERRC. \nA summary of our process to manage each of our major risk categories follows:\nStrategic risk and return management\n \nencompasses risks and opportunities associated with long-term business planning and strategy setting in the context of the evolving market environment.\nAreas of focus include macroeconomic, regulatory and competitive conditions, as well as customer preferences and behavior, Allstate’s reputation and the continuous enhancement of internal capabilities that allow Allstate to compete effectively in chosen markets. Allstate manages strategic risks in part through Allstate Board and senior management reviews that include risk and return assessment of strategic plans and ongoing monitoring of strategic actions, key assumptions and the broader market environment.\nInsurance risk and return management \nencompasses risks and opportunities associated with Allstate’s insurance activities, including expected trends and unanticipated fluctuations in premiums, \nThe Allstate Corporation      79\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nEnterprise Risk and Return Management\nclaims and future profits. Focus areas include loss frequency and severity trends and scenarios, severe weather and catastrophe exposures and claim handling processes. Allstate uses sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to measure, monitor and manage associated risk exposures, including stochastic risk estimation and deterministic scenario analysis.\nInvestment risk and return management \nencompasses risks and opportunities associated with Allstate’s investment portfolio. Areas of focus include macroeconomic conditions and potential changes to key variables such as interest rates, credit spreads and equity price levels, as well as specific factors that may impact the returns associated with individual investments. Changes in such factors drive daily volatility in the valuations of portfolio holdings and could cause permanent impairments of capital due to credit defaults and equity write-downs.\nInvestment risk exposures are measured and monitored using tools such as sensitivity analysis, stochastic risk estimation and deterministic scenario analysis, which together are used to assess investment portfolio risk characteristics and how the investment portfolio contributes to the enterprise risk profile.\nFinancial risk and return management \naddresses the sufficiency of capital and cash flow liquidity to meet enterprise, subsidiary and policyholder needs. We actively manage associated risks and opportunities in light of changing market, economic and business conditions using modeling frameworks and tools that assess potential sources and uses of capital and liquidity and help ensure strategic and financial flexibility.\nWe generally assess solvency on a statutory accounting basis, but also consider holding company capital and liquidity needs. Capital at the insurance companies significantly exceeds regulatory risk-based capital requirements and capital levels at the parent holding company provide liquidity and financial flexibility to meet enterprise requirements.\nOperational risk and return management\n \nencompasses risks and opportunities associated with Allstate’s interconnected systems of people, processes and technology. Representative areas of focus include talent, privacy, regulatory compliance, ethics, fraud, system availability, cybersecurity, data quality, disaster recovery and business continuity.\nAssociated risks are managed using an integrated Operational Risk and Return Management framework anchored to the ERRM Learning Loop, a continual process which includes risk identification, measurement, management, monitoring, and reporting.\nCulture risk and return management\n \naddresses risks and opportunities associated with company culture, which we define as our self-sustaining system of shared values, principles and priorities that shape beliefs, drive behavior and influence decision-making. Allstate’s approach to culture risk and return management is grounded in risk and return principles and organized by Our Shared Purpose, targeting continual alignment of culture with the company’s mission, values, operating standards and behaviors.\nBoth operational and culture risk and return measurements and reviews are shared with key stakeholders and governance committees throughout the year.\n80      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates \nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The most critical estimates, presented in the order they appear in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, include those used in determining:\n•\nFair value of financial assets\n•\nImpairment of fixed income securities with credit losses\n•\nEvaluation of goodwill\n•\nReserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense estimation\n•\nPension and other postretirement plans net costs and assumptions\nIn making these determinations, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our businesses and operations. It is reasonably likely that changes in these estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nA summary of each of these critical accounting estimates follows. For a more detailed discussion of the effect of these estimates on our consolidated financial statements, and the judgments and assumptions related to these estimates, see the referenced sections of this document. For a more detailed summary of our significant accounting policies, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nFair value of financial assets\n \n \nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We are responsible for the determination of fair value of financial assets and the supporting assumptions and methodologies. We use independent third-party valuation service providers, broker quotes and internal pricing methods to determine fair values. We utilize one quote or price to value each financial instrument in our financial statements.\nValuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of proprietary models, produce valuation information in the form of a single fair value for individual fixed income and other securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of our agreements. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities, interest rate yield curves, \ncredit spreads, liquidity spreads, currency rates, and other information, as applicable. Credit and liquidity spreads are typically implied from completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities. Valuation service providers also use proprietary discounted cash flow models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry and similar to those used by other market participants to value the same financial instruments. The valuation models take into account, among other things, market observable information (as described above) as of the measurement date, as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and where applicable, collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information. Executing valuation models effectively requires seasoned professional judgment and experience. For certain equity securities, valuation service providers provide market quotations for completed transactions on the measurement date. In cases where market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied varies inversely with the availability of market observable information.\nFor certain of our financial assets measured at fair value, where our valuation service providers cannot provide fair value determinations, we obtain a single non-binding price quote from a broker familiar with the security who, similar to our valuation service providers, may consider transactions or activity in similar securities among other information. The brokers providing price quotes are generally from the brokerage divisions of financial institutions with market making, underwriting and distribution expertise regarding the security subject to valuation.\nThe fair value of certain financial assets, including privately placed corporate fixed income securities and free-standing derivatives, for which our valuation service providers or brokers do not provide fair value determinations, is developed using valuation methods and models widely accepted in the financial services industry. Our internal pricing methods are primarily based on models using discounted cash flow methodologies that develop a single best estimate of fair value. Our models generally incorporate inputs that we believe are representative of inputs other market participants would use to determine fair value of the same instruments, including yield curves, quoted market prices of comparable securities or instruments, published credit spreads, and other applicable market data as well as instrument-specific characteristics that include, but are not limited to, coupon rates, expected cash flows, sector of the issuer, and call provisions. Because judgment is required in developing the fair values of these financial assets, they may differ from the amount actually received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Moreover, the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the financial assets’ fair values.\nFor most of our financial assets measured at fair value, all significant inputs are based on or \nThe Allstate Corporation      81\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n \nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\ncorroborated by market observable data, and significant management judgment does not affect the periodic determination of fair value. The determination of fair value using discounted cash flow models involves management judgment when significant model inputs are not based on or corroborated by market observable data. However, where market observable data is available, it takes precedence, and as a result, no range of reasonably likely inputs exists from which the basis of a sensitivity analysis could be constructed.\nWe gain assurance that our financial assets are appropriately valued through the execution of various processes and controls designed to ensure the overall reasonableness and consistent application of valuation methodologies, including inputs and assumptions, and compliance with accounting standards. For fair values received from third parties or internally estimated, our processes and controls are designed to ensure that the valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistently applied, the inputs and assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value, and the fair values are accurately recorded. For example, on a continuing basis, we assess the reasonableness of individual fair values that have stale security prices or that exceed certain thresholds as compared to previous fair values received from valuation service providers or brokers or derived from internal models. We perform procedures to understand and assess the methodologies, processes and controls of valuation service providers. In addition, we may validate the reasonableness of fair \nvalues by comparing information obtained from valuation service providers or brokers to other third-party valuation sources for selected securities. We perform ongoing price validation procedures such as back-testing of actual sales, which corroborate the various inputs used in internal models to market observable data. When fair value determinations are expected to be more variable, we validate them through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investment transactions.\nDuring periods of high volatility or market disruption, we may perform an analysis to determine whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared to normal market activity, and if so, whether transactions may not be orderly. Among the indicators we consider in determining whether a significant decrease in the volume and level of market activity for a specific asset has occurred include the level of new issuances in the primary market, trading volume in the secondary market, level of credit spreads over historical levels, bid-ask spread, and price consensuses among market participants and sources. If evidence indicates that prices are based on transactions that are not orderly, we place little, if any, weight on the transaction price and will estimate fair value using an internal model. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not adjust fair values provided by our valuation service providers or brokers or substitute them with an internal model for such securities.\nFixed income, equity securities and short-term investments by source of fair value determination\nDecember 31, 2024\n($ in millions)\nFair value\nPercent \nto total\nFair value based on internal sources\n$\n563 \n0.9 \n%\nFair value based on external sources \n(1)\n61,184 \n99.1 \nTotal\n$\n61,747\n \n100.0\n \n%\n(1)\nIncludes $129 million that are valued using broker quotes and $341 million that are valued using quoted prices or quoted net asset values from deal sponsors.\nFor additional detail on fair value measurements, see Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of fixed income securities with credit losses \n \nFor fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale, the difference between amortized cost, net of credit loss allowance (“amortized cost, net”) and fair value, net of certain other items and deferred income taxes (as disclosed in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements), is reported as a component of AOCI on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when a credit loss allowance is recorded. We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income security that may require a credit loss allowance.\nFor each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position, we assess whether management with the \nappropriate authority\n \nhas made the decision to sell or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity, contractual or regulatory purposes. If a security meets either of these criteria, any existing credit loss allowance would be written-off against the amortized cost basis of the asset along with any remaining unrealized losses, with the incremental losses recorded in earnings.\nIf we have not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we evaluate whether we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We calculate the estimated recovery value based on the best estimate of future cash flows considering past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The estimated future cash flows are discounted at the security’s current effective rate and are compared to the amortized cost of the \n82      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates \nsecurity. The determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective, and methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security. All reasonably available information relevant to the collectability of the security are considered when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. That information generally includes, but is not limited to, as applicable, the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer, expected defaults, expected recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, origination vintage year, geographic concentration of underlying collateral, available reserves or escrows, current subordination levels, third-party guarantees and other credit enhancements. Other information, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, and other market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows, may also be considered. The estimated fair value of collateral will be used to estimate recovery value if we determine that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement.\nIf we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income security, a credit loss allowance is recorded in earnings for the shortfall in expected cash flows; however, the amortized cost, net of the credit loss allowance, may not be lower than the fair value of the security. The portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit remains classified in AOCI. If we determine that the fixed income security does not have sufficient cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery value for the security, we may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded in earnings.\nWhen a security is sold or otherwise disposed or the security is deemed uncollectible and written off, we reverse amounts previously recognized in the credit loss allowance. Recoveries after write-offs are recognized when received.\nFor additional detail on investment impairments, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.\nEvaluation of goodwill \nGoodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired, less any impairment of goodwill recognized. Goodwill is recognized when acquired and allocated to reporting units based on which unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Our goodwill reporting units are equivalent to our reportable segments to which goodwill has been assigned: Allstate Protection, Protection Services, and Allstate Health and Benefits. \nThe goodwill balance was $3.25 billion at December 31, 2024 and $3.50 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was related to the reclassification of goodwill as held for sale as of December 31, 2024 due to the pending sale of the employer voluntary benefits business.\nUpon acquisition, the purchase price of the acquired business is assumed to be its fair value. Subsequently, we estimate the fair value of our businesses in each goodwill reporting unit, utilizing a combination of widely accepted valuation techniques including a stock price and market capitalization analysis, discounted cash flow (“DCF”) calculations and an estimate of a business’s fair value using market to book multiples derived from peer company analysis. The stock price and market capitalization analysis take into consideration the quoted market price of our outstanding common stock and includes a control premium, derived from relevant historical acquisition activity, in determining the estimated fair value of the consolidated entity before allocating that fair value to individual reporting units. The DCF analysis utilizes long term assumptions for revenues, investment income, benefits, claims, other operating expenses and income taxes to produce projections of both income and cash flows available for dividends that are present valued using the weighted average cost of capital. Market to book multiples represent the mean market to book multiple for selected peer companies with operations similar to each goodwill reporting unit to which the multiple is applied. The outputs from these methods are weighted based on the nature of the business and the relative amount of market observable assumptions supporting the estimates. The computed values are then weighted to reflect the fair value estimate based on the specific attributes of each goodwill reporting unit.\nEstimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of significant estimates by management. Changes in market inputs or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses, including discount rates, operating results, investment returns, strategies and growth rate assumptions, among other factors, could result in goodwill impairments, resulting in a charge to income. Certain of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have substantial internally generated and unrecognized intangibles and fair values that significantly exceed their carrying values. \nChanges in our growth assumptions, including the risk of loss of key customers in the Protection Services segment, or adverse changes in discount rates could result in a decline in fair value and result in a goodwill impairment charge.\nReserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense estimation \n \nReserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims and claims expenses under insurance policies we have issued. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling incurred claims as of the financial statement date. \n Allstate Protection’s current period claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little lag between the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported. Auto and homeowners liability losses \nThe Allstate Corporation      83\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n \nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\ngenerally take an average of about two years to settle, while auto physical damage, homeowners property and other personal lines generally have an average settlement time of less than one year. Liability losses, especially those involving litigation, can take many years to resolve. Run-off Property-Liability involves long-tail losses, such as those related to asbestos and environmental claims, which often involve substantial reporting lags and extended times to settle.\nEstimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables. Underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense reserves.  \nThe actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates\n \n Reserve estimates are derived by using several different actuarial estimation methods that are variations on one primary actuarial technique known as a “chain ladder” estimation process. In this process, historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. \nIn the chain ladder estimation technique, development factors are calculated which compare current period results to results in the prior period for each accident year or report year. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process, as development factors use historic data that incorporates inflation from recent prior periods in estimating future loss costs. The estimation methodology may require modification when data changes due to changing claim reporting practices, changing claim settlement patterns, external regulatory or financial influences, or contractual coverage changes. Changes in such items and inflation can result in increased variability in loss costs and reserve estimates. Actuarial judgment is then applied to develop a best estimate of gross ultimate losses. These developments are discussed further in the loss ratio disclosures within the Allstate Protection Segment and the Reserve for Property and Casualty Insurance Claims and Claims Expense sections of the MD&A. See the Run-off Property-Liability reserve estimates section for specific disclosures of industry and actuarial best practices for this segment.\nHow reserve estimates are established and updated\n \nReserve estimates are developed at a detailed level, and the results are aggregated to form a consolidated reserve estimate. The detailed estimates include each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), major states or groups of states and for reported losses and IBNR. The significant lines of business are auto, homeowners, and other personal lines for Allstate Protection, and asbestos, environmental, and other run-off lines for Run-off Property-Liability. Reserves are established for each business segment and line of business, independently of business segment management.\nDevelopment factors are calculated for data elements such as claim counts reported and settled, paid losses, and paid losses combined with case reserves. The historical development patterns for these data elements are used to calculate reserve estimates. Based on this review, our best estimate of required reserves is recorded.\nReserves are reestimated quarterly and periodically throughout the year, by combining historical results with current actual results to calculate new development factors. This process continuously incorporates the historic and latest actual trends, and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates. New development factors are likely to differ from previous development factors used in prior reserve estimates because actual results occur differently than the assumptions contained in the previous development factor calculations. When actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate, a new reserve is determined. The difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves (the previous estimate) is the amount of reserve reestimate. This amount, which could be material and vary significantly from period to period, is recognized as an increase or decrease in Property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nA more detailed discussion of reserve reestimates is presented in the Reserve for Property and Casualty Insurance Claims and Claims Expense section of the MD&A.\n84      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates \nNet reserves by segment and line of business \nAs of December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAllstate Protection\nAuto\n$\n23,076 \n$\n21,286 \n$\n19,365 \nHomeowners\n4,520 \n4,754 \n3,520 \nOther lines \n(1)\n4,250 \n3,929 \n3,991 \nTotal Allstate Protection\n31,846\n \n29,969\n \n26,876\n \nRun-off Property-Liability\nAsbestos\n774 \n804 \n811 \nEnvironmental\n259 \n267 \n267 \nOther run-off lines\n381 \n373 \n373 \nTotal Run-off Property-Liability\n1,414\n \n1,444\n \n1,451\n \nTotal Protection Services\n55\n \n49\n \n38\n \nTotal net reserves\n$\n33,315\n \n$\n31,462\n \n$\n28,365\n \n(1)\nIncludes the unamortized fair value adjustment related to the acquisition of National General.\nReserve reestimates \n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nReserve reestimates, after-tax \n(1) \n$\n(243)\n$\n434 \n$\n1,375 \nPercentage impact on net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders - favorable (unfavorable)\n5.3 \n%\nNM\n(98.6)\n%\n(1)\nFavorable reserve reestimates are shown in parentheses.\n3-year average of net reserve reestimates as a percentage of total reserves for its segment \n(1) (2)\n2024\nAllstate Protection\n1.9 \n%\nRun-off Property-Liability\n6.5 \n(1)\nFavorable reserve reestimates are shown in parentheses.\n(2)\nEach of these results is consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for the respective businesses.\nAllstate Protection reserve estimate\nFactors affecting reserve estimates  \nGenerally, the initial reserves for a new accident year or report year are established based on actual claim frequency and severity assumptions for different business segments, lines and coverages based on historical relationships to relevant inflation indicators. Reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using processes described above. These estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances, including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, changes in laws and regulations, judicial decisions, and economic conditions.\n Changes in auto claim frequency may result from changes in mix of business, driving behaviors, miles driven or other macroeconomic factors. Changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors, changes in attorney represented and litigated claim behavior, the effectiveness and efficiency of our claim settlements and changes in mix of claim types. Injury claims are affected largely by medical inflation, \ntreatment trends, attorney representation and litigation costs while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation, used car prices, length of claim resolution and the timing of receipt of third-party carrier claims. \nChanges in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, deductibles, other economic and environmental factors and the effectiveness of our claim practices.\nAs loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss, it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility. From that point in time forward, reserves are reestimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact actual loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial estimation processes. \nLoss experience and reserve variability are impacted by many factors, including but not limited to:\n•\nSupply chain disruptions and labor shortages, changes in used car prices, labor and part cost increases, unemployment levels, changes in commuting activity and driving behavior have and may continue to lead to historical development trends being less predictive of future loss development, potentially creating additional reserve variability. \n•\nIf a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity for a coverage which is part of a particular line of insurance in a specific state, judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific estimate.\n•\nIf a change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to damaged autos or property for a particular line, coverage, or state, actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the \nThe Allstate Corporation      85\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n \nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nreserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development.\nCauses of reserve estimate uncertainty\n  At each reporting date, the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates for most of our losses from ongoing businesses arise from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year. The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled as well as heightened uncertainty for claims that involve litigation or take longer to settle during periods of rapidly increasing loss costs but must be estimated as of the current reporting date. Most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and homes, and medical care for injuries from accidents. During the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled. When accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. After the second year, the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation. Private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual percentage payout of reserves remaining at December 31 for an accident year is approximately 50% in the first year after the end of the accident year, 20% in the second year, 10% in the third year, 10% in the fourth year, and the remaining 10% thereafter.\nPotential variability in reserve estimates\n  Reserve estimates, by their nature, are very complex to determine, subject to significant judgment, and represent estimates rather than an exact determination for each outstanding claim, including claims incurred but not reported. Accordingly, as actual claims, paid losses, and case reserve results emerge, our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle will differ from previous estimates.\nThe reserve liability recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position represents the aggregation of numerous analyses by each business segment, line of insurance, major types of losses (such as coverages and perils), and individual states or groups of states for reported losses and IBNR. Because of this detailed approach to our reserve analysis, there is not a single set of assumptions that determines our reserve estimates at the consolidated level or that management believes can produce a statistically credible or reliable actuarial reserve range that would be meaningful. \nTo develop a statistical measure of potential reserve variability, an actuarial technique (stochastic modeling) is applied to the countrywide data for paid losses combined with case reserves for each of auto liability, auto physical damage, and homeowners insurance excluding catastrophes. Based on the combined historical variability of the development \nfactors calculated for these data elements, an estimate of standard deviation around these reserve estimates is calculated within each accident year for the last twelve years for each type of loss. The variability of these reserve estimates within one standard deviation of the mean (a measure of frequency of dispersion often viewed to be an acceptable level of accuracy) is believed by management to represent a reasonable and statistically probable measure of potential variability.  \nBased on our Allstate brand products and coverages, historical experience, the statistical credibility of our extensive data and stochastic modeling of actuarial methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we have derived standard deviations and the resulting pre-tax income for Allstate Protection reserves, excluding catastrophe losses, as shown below.\nReserve estimate variability\nDecember 31, 2024\n($ in millions)\nCarried reserves \n(1)\nStandard deviation\nIncome effect, pre-tax\nAuto insurance - liability coverage\n$\n28,800 \n6.5 \n%\n$\n1,872 \nAuto insurance - physical damage coverage\n755 \n15.5 \n117 \nHomeowners insurance\n3,475 \n8.0 \n278 \n(1) \nExcludes reserves related to catastrophes.\nAlthough this evaluation reflects most reasonably likely outcomes, it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts. Historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the Reserve for Property and Casualty Insurance Claims and Claims Expense section of the MD&A.\nManagement believes that the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense, net of recoverables, is appropriately established in the aggregate and adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of reported and unreported claims arising from losses which had occurred by the date of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on available facts, laws and regulations.\nReserves for catastrophe losses\n \nCatastrophe losses\n \nare an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance industry that have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to potentially material year-to-year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position. We define a “catastrophe” as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first-party policyholders, or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms and freezes, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. \n86      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates \nWe are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism, civil unrest, wildfires or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.\nThe estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophe losses also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and IBNR, primarily for damage to property. In general, our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described above. However, depending on the nature of the catastrophe, the estimation process can be further complicated. \nFor example, for hurricanes, complications could include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses, limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses, determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy (generally for damage caused by wind or wind-driven rain) or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood, exposure to mold damage, and the effects of numerous other considerations. Additionally, the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events, such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period, can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period. In these situations, we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe. \nFor example, to complete estimates for certain areas affected by catastrophes not yet inspected by our claims adjusting staff, or where we believed our historical loss development factors were not predictive, we rely on:\n•\nAnalysis of actual claim notices received compared to total PIF.\n•\nVisual, governmental and third-party information, including aerial photos, using satellites, aircrafts and drones, area observations, and data on wind speed and flood depth to the extent available. \nReserves for Michigan and New Jersey unlimited PIP \n Claims and claims expense reserves include reserves for Michigan unlimited PIP coverage to insureds involved in qualifying motor vehicle accidents. The administration of this program is through the MCCA, a state-mandated, non-profit association of which all insurers actively writing automobile coverage in Michigan are members. \nThe process employed to estimate MCCA covered losses involves a number of activities including the comprehensive review and interpretation of MCCA actuarial reports, other MCCA members’ reports and our PIP loss trends which have increased in severity over time. A significant portion of incurred claim reserves can be attributed to a small number of catastrophic claims and thus a large portion of the recoverable is similarly concentrated. We conduct comprehensive claim file reviews to develop case \nreserve type estimates of specific claims, which inform our view of future claim development and longevity of claimants. Each year, we update the actuarial estimate of our ultimate reserves and recoverables. We report our paid and unpaid claims based on MCCA requirements. The MCCA develops its own reserving estimates based on its own reserve methodologies, which may not align with our estimations. The MCCA does not provide member companies with its estimate of a company’s claim costs. \nWe provide similar PIP coverage in New Jersey for auto policies issued or renewed in New Jersey prior to 1991 that is administered by PLIGA. We use similar actuarial estimating techniques as for the MCCA exposures to estimate loss reserves for unlimited PIP coverage for policies covered by PLIGA. Unlimited coverage was not offered after 1991; therefore, no new claimants are being added.\nReserve estimates are confidential and proprietary and by their nature are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgments. Reserve estimates do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim. Claims may be subject to litigation. As actual claims, paid losses and case reserve results emerge, our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle may be materially greater or less than previously estimated amounts. \nFor additional information related to indemnification recoverables, see Item 1 - Regulation, Indemnification Programs and Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.\nRun-off Property-Liability reserve estimates\n \nCharacteristics of Run-off exposure\n \n \nOur exposure to asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims arise principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s, including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large U.S. companies, and from direct excess commercial insurance written from 1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general liability coverages on large U.S. companies. Additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by claimants who were exposed to asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs. Other run-off claims exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices and other products, workers’ compensation claims and claims for various other coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental.\nIn 1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property and casualty industry was amended to introduce an “absolute pollution exclusion,” which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. General liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product \nThe Allstate Corporation      87\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n \nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nliability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages. Our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks.\nOur exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct excess commercial insurance or direct primary commercial insurance. Direct excess commercial insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans and largely has resulted in asbestos, environmental and mass tort claims. The nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention on their primary insurance plans. Our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct excess business.\nOur assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers’ reinsurance programs. The reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. Of the majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85% is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15% is for pro-rata coverage.\nOur direct primary commercial insurance business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors throughout the country and did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers.\nHow reserve estimates are established and updated\n \nWe conduct an annual review in the third quarter to evaluate, establish and adjust as necessary, asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims reserves. Changes to reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines asbestos reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g., claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, and determines environmental reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g., environmental damages, respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, appropriateness and cost of remediation) to pollution and related clean-up costs. The number and cost of these claims are affected by advertising by trial lawyers seeking asbestos plaintiffs, and entities with asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities, initially causing a delay in the reporting of claims, often followed by an acceleration and an increase in claims and claims expenses as settlements occur.\nAfter evaluating our insureds’ probable liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims, we evaluate our insureds’ coverage programs for such \nclaims. We consider our insureds’ total available insurance coverage, including the coverage we issued. We also consider relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.\nEvaluation of both the insureds’ estimated liabilities and our exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This analysis is conducted by our specialized claims adjusting staff and legal counsel. Based on these evaluations, case reserves are established by claims adjusting staff and actuarial analysis is employed to develop an IBNR reserve, which includes estimated potential reserve development and claims that have occurred but have not been reported. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, IBNR was 54.0% and 55.7%, respectively, of combined net asbestos and environmental reserves.\nFor both asbestos and environmental reserves, we also evaluate our historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity. Other run-off claims reserves are based on considerations similar to those described above, as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures.\nPotential reserve estimate variability\n \n Establishing net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of property and casualty claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits; plaintiffs’ evolving and expanding theories of liability; availability and collectability of recoveries from reinsurance; retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements; estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual liability; the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants; and other uncertainties. \nThere are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean-up costs represent insured property damage. \nOur reserves for asbestos, environmental and other run-off exposures could be affected by tort \n88      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates \nreform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial decisions. Environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal Superfund law and similar state statutes. There can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost-efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. We believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful net loss reserve range. Historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the Property and Casualty Insurance Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.\nAdequacy of reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense estimates\nWe believe our net reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, laws and regulations and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g., claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. Additionally, we rely on historical claims experience to inform the level of the recorded reserve. We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards and practices, for each line of insurance, its components (coverages and perils) and state, for reported losses and for IBNR losses, and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount. Due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best estimates. \nFor further discussion of these estimates and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see Note 10 and Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements and the Reserve for Property and Casualty Insurance Claims and Claims Expense section of the MD&A.\nPension and other postretirement plans net costs and assumptions  \nOur pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, expected returns on plan assets, mortality and other factors. The assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our defined benefit plans represent our best estimates, and we believe they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other \nfactors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends. Approximately 90% of our benefit obligation relates to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan.\nSee Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nNet costs for our defined benefit plans are recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and consist of two elements: 1) costs comprised of service and interest costs, expected return of plan assets, amortization of prior service credit and curtailment gains and losses which are reported in property and casualty claims and claims expense, operating costs and expenses, net investment income and, if applicable, restructuring and related charges and 2) remeasurement gains and losses comprised of changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets which are recognized immediately in earnings as part of pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses.\nWe recognize expected returns on plan assets using an unadjusted fair value method. Our policy is to remeasure our pension and postretirement plans on a quarterly basis. We immediately recognize the remeasurement of the benefit obligation and plan assets in earnings as it provides greater transparency of our economic obligations in accounting results and better aligns the recognition of the effects of economic and interest rate changes on pension and other postretirement plan assets and liabilities in the year in which the gains and losses are incurred.\nDifferences in actual experience and changes in other assumptions affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and expenses. Differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets affect remeasurement gains and losses. The primary factors contributing to pension and postretirement remeasurement gains and losses are: 1) changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement obligations as of the measurement date; 2) differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets; 3) changes in demographic assumptions, including mortality and participant experience; and 4) changes in lump sum interest rates and cash balance interest crediting rates used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date. \nPension and other postretirement service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credits are allocated to our reportable segments. The pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses are reported in the Corporate and Other segment.\nThe Allstate Corporation      89\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n \nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nPension and postretirement benefits remeasurement gains and losses\nFor the years ended December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRemeasurement of benefit obligation (gains) losses:\nDiscount rate\n$\n(133)\n$\n104 \n$\n(1,268)\nOther assumptions\n4 \n17 \n(176)\nRemeasurement of plan assets (gains) losses\n92 \n(112)\n1,560 \nRemeasurement (gains) losses\n$\n(37)\n$\n9\n \n$\n116\n \nImpact of assumption changes to net cost for pension and other postretirement plans  \nRemeasurement gains in 2024 primarily related to an increase in the liability discount rate and changes in other assumptions, partially offset by unfavorable asset performance compared to expected return on plan assets. Remeasurement losses in 2023 primarily related to losses on the remeasurement of the projected benefit obligation driven by a decrease in the liability discount rate, partially offset by gains due to favorable asset performance compared to expected return on plan assets.\nThe discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date. We develop the assumed discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from non-callable bonds and callable bonds with a make-whole provision available in the Bloomberg corporate bond universe having ratings of “AA” by S&P or “Aa” by Moody’s on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements. Significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by changes in the credit spreads, yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost. The weighted average discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation increased to 5.71% on December 31, 2024 compared to 5.35% on December 31, 2023, resulting in remeasurement gains for 2024.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. While this rate reflects long-term assumptions and is consistent with long-term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in \nthe mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are immediately recognized through earnings at each quarterly remeasurement date. Short-term asset performance can differ significantly from the expected rate of return, especially in volatile markets. In 2024, the actual return on plan assets was lower than the expected return primarily due to lower fixed income valuations driven by higher rates, partially offset by higher equity valuations. In 2023, the actual return on plan assets was higher than the expected return primarily due to positive equity returns and higher fixed income valuations from lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads.\nWe complete periodic evaluations of demographic information and historical experience that affects our pension and other postretirement obligations to identify any required changes to long-term actuarial assumptions and methodologies. Demographic assumptions affect both our pension and postretirement plans and include elements such as retirement rates and participation rates in our postretirement programs, among other factors.\nThese actuarial assumption updates affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and are incorporated into our best estimates of these assumptions. Remeasurement losses for other assumptions in 2024 primarily related to an increase in the cash balance interest crediting rate, partially offset by gains from an experience study. Remeasurement losses for other assumptions in 2023 primarily related to a decrease in the long-term lump sum interest rate, partially offset by gains from mortality updates. \nImpact of assumption changes to net periodic pension cost as of December 31, 2024\n($ in millions)\nBasis/percentage point change\nIncrease (decrease) to net cost, pre-tax\nPension plans discount rate\n+100 basis points\n$\n(392)\n-100 basis points\n467 \nExpected long-term rate of return on assets\n+100 basis points\n(41)\n-100 basis points\n41 \n90      www.allstate.com\n \n2024 Form 10-K\nRegulation and Legal Proceedings \nWe are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business.

\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1\nGeneral\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Allstate Corporation (the “Corporation”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, primarily Allstate Insurance Company (“AIC”), a property and casualty insurance company (collectively referred to as the “Company” or “Allstate”) and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which the Company is considered a primary beneficiary. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nNature of operations\nAllstate is engaged, principally in the United States, in the property and casualty insurance business. Allstate is one of the country’s largest personal property and casualty insurers and is organized into \nfive\n reportable segments: Allstate Protection, Run-off Property-Liability, Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits, and Corporate and Other.\nAllstate’s primary business is the sale of private passenger auto and homeowners insurance. The Company offers several other personal property and casualty insurance products, select commercial property and casualty coverages, consumer product protection plans, device and mobile data collection services and analytic solutions using automotive telematics information, roadside assistance, automotive protection and insurance products, identity protection, employer voluntary benefits and group and individual accident and health insurance. Allstate primarily distributes its products through exclusive agents, independent agents and brokers, direct to consumers through contact centers and online and through financial specialists and major retailers.\nHeld for sale \nA business is classified as held for sale when management having the authority to approve the action commits to a plan to sell the business, the sale is probable to occur during the next 12 months at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and certain other criteria are met. A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. When the proceeds expected to be received from the sale exceed the carrying amount of the business, a gain is recognized when the sale closes.\nAssets and liabilities related to a business classified as held for sale are segregated in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in the period in which the business is classified as held for sale. \nOn August 13, 2024, Allstate entered into a share purchase agreement with StanCorp Financial Group, Inc. to sell Allstate’s employer voluntary benefits business. Additional details related to the pending sale are included in Note 4.\nRisks and uncertainties\nAllstate has exposure to catastrophic events, including wind/hail, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, severe freeze events, volcanic eruptions, terrorism and industrial accidents.\nCatastrophes, an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance business, have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to material year-to-year fluctuations in the Company’s results of operations and financial position (see Note 10). The nature and level of catastrophic loss experienced in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company considers the following categories and locations to be the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses: \n•\nWind/Hail, Precipitation, Tornado and Freeze — Major metropolitan centers in Texas, Illinois, Georgia and Colorado\n•\nHurricanes — Major metropolitan centers along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States\n•\nWildfires — California, Colorado, Oregon, Texas and Hawaii\n•\nEarthquakes and fires following earthquakes —Major metropolitan centers near fault lines in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, South Carolina and Kentucky\nSubsequent Events\n Group health business disposition  \nOn January 30, 2025, Allstate entered into an agreement with Nationwide Life Insurance Company to sell Direct General Life Insurance Company, NSM Sales Corporation and The Association Benefits Solution, LLC, comprising the group health business for approximately $\n1.25\n billion in cash, adjusted for the closing balance sheet. The group health business is reported in the Health and Benefits segment, and beginning in the first quarter of 2025, the assets and liabilities of the business will be classified as held for sale. The transaction is expected to close during 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. \nThe transaction price less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value of net assets related to the transaction, \n98      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nresulting in an expected gain that will be recognized at closing of the transaction. The anticipated gain on the sale will be impacted by purchase price adjustments associated with certain pre-close transactions, changes in the carrying value of net assets, changes in accumulated other comprehensive income and the related tax effects. \nThe group health business generated $\n481\n million of premiums and contract charges and adjusted net income of $\n71\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nCalifornia wildfire catastrophe event  \nIn January \n2025, several wildfires started in southern California that have destroyed or damaged thousands of properties and automobiles. The Company’s estimated catastrophe losses for this event are $\n1.07\n billion. The estimate includes reinsurance reinstatement premiums, an estimated California FAIR Plan assessment and is net of estimated reinsurance recoveries. For more information on the California FAIR Plan, refer to Note 16. Expected recoveries under the Company’s Nationwide Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance Program and reinsurance reinstatement premiums required to be paid under the terms of the reinsurance program are further described in Note 12.\nNote 2\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \nInvestments\nFixed income securities include bonds and asset-backed securities (“ABS”). Fixed income securities, which may be sold prior to their contractual maturity, are designated as available-for-sale (“AFS”) and are carried at fair value. The difference between amortized cost, net of credit loss allowances (“amortized cost, net”) and fair value, net of deferred income taxes, is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The Company excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of its AFS fixed income securities. Cash received from calls and make-whole payments is reflected as a component of proceeds from sales and cash received from maturities and pay-downs is reflected as a component of investment collections within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nEquity securities primarily include common stocks, exchange traded and mutual funds, non-redeemable preferred stocks and real estate investment trust equity investments. Certain exchange traded and mutual funds have fixed income securities as their underlying investments. Equity securities are carried at fair value. Equity securities without readily determinable or estimable fair values are measured using the measurement alternative, which is cost less impairment, if any, and adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\nMortgage loans and bank loans are carried at amortized cost, net, which represent the amount expected to be collected. The Company excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of its mortgage and bank loans. Credit loss allowances are estimates of expected credit losses, established for loans upon origination or purchase, and are established considering all relevant information available, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts over the life of the loans. Loans are evaluated on a pooled basis when they share similar risk characteristics; otherwise, they are evaluated individually. \nInvestments in limited partnership interests are primarily accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting (“EMA”) and include interests in private equity funds, real estate funds and other funds. \nInvestments in limited partnership interests purchased prior to January 1, 2018, where the Company’s interest is so minor that it exercises virtually no influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for at fair value primarily utilizing the net asset value (“NAV”) as a practical expedient to determine fair value.\nShort-term investments, including money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury bills, fixed income securities with a contractual maturity of one year or less at time of acquisition and other short-term investments, are carried at fair value. Other investments primarily consist of bank loans, real estate and derivatives. Bank loans are primarily senior secured corporate loans. Real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Derivatives are carried at fair value.\nInvestment income primarily consists of interest, dividends, income from limited partnership interests, rental income from real estate and income from certain derivative transactions. \nInterest is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective yield method and dividends are recorded at the ex-dividend date. Interest income for ABS is determined considering estimated pay-downs, including prepayments, obtained from third-party data sources and internal estimates. Actual prepayment experience is periodically reviewed, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between the prepayments originally anticipated and the actual prepayments received and currently anticipated. For ABS of high credit quality with fixed interest rates, the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis. For all others, the effective yield is generally recalculated on a prospective basis. Accrual of income is suspended for fixed income securities when the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be received is not probable. Accrual of income is suspended for mortgage loans and bank loans that are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not probable. Accrued income receivable is monitored for recoverability, and when not expected to be collected, is written off within net investment income. Cash receipts for investments on nonaccrual status are generally recorded as a reduction of amortized cost. \nThe Allstate Corporation      99\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIncome from limited partnership interests carried at fair value is recognized based upon the changes in fair value of the investee’s equity primarily determined using NAV. Income from EMA limited partnership interests is recognized based on the Company’s share of the partnerships’ earnings. Income from EMA limited partnership interests is generally recognized on a three month delay due to the availability of the related financial statements from investees. \nNet gains and losses on investments and derivatives include gains and losses on investment sales, changes in the credit loss allowances related to fixed income securities, mortgage loans and bank loans, impairments, valuation changes of equity investments, including equity securities and certain limited partnerships where the underlying assets are predominately public equity securities, and periodic changes in fair value and settlements of certain derivatives, including hedge ineffectiveness. Net gains and losses on sales of investments and derivatives are determined on a specific identification basis and are net of credit losses already recognized through an allowance.\nDerivative and embedded derivative financial instruments\nDerivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, futures (interest rate and equity), options (including swaptions), warrants and stock rights, foreign currency forwards and total return swaps.\nAll derivatives are accounted for on a fair value basis and reported as other investments, other assets and other liabilities and accrued expenses. Embedded derivative instruments subject to bifurcation are also accounted for on a fair value basis and are reported together with the host contract. Cash flows from other derivatives are reported in cash flows from investing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n For derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied, the income statement effects, including fair value gains and losses and accrued periodic settlements, are reported either in net gains and losses on investments and derivatives or in a single line item together with the results of the associated asset or liability for which risks are being managed.\nSecurities loaned\nThe Company’s business activities include securities lending transactions, which are used primarily to generate net investment income. The proceeds received in conjunction with securities lending transactions can be reinvested in short-term investments or fixed income securities. These transactions are short-term in nature, usually \n30\n days or less.\nThe Company receives cash collateral for securities loaned in an amount generally equal to \n102\n% and \n105\n% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively, and records the related obligations to return the collateral in other liabilities and accrued \nexpenses. The carrying value of these obligations approximates fair value because of their relatively short-term nature. The Company monitors the market value of securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains additional collateral as necessary under the terms of the agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company maintains the right and ability to repossess the securities loaned on short notice.\nRecognition of premium revenues and contract charges, and related benefits and interest credited\nProperty and casualty insurance premiums include premiums from personal lines policies, protection plans, vehicle service contracts and insurance products and roadside assistance.\nPersonal lines insurance premiums are deferred and earned on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies, typically periods of \nsix\n or \ntwelve months\n.\nRevenues related to protection plans, vehicle service contracts and insurance products and roadside assistance are deferred and earned over the term of the contract in a manner that recognizes revenue as obligations under the contracts are fulfilled. Revenues from these products are classified as premiums as the products are backed by insurance. Protection plans and protection and insurance premiums are recognized using a cost-based incurrence method over the term of the contracts, which is generally \none\n to \nfive years\n.\nThe portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums.\nUnearned premiums\nDecember 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nAllstate Protection\n$\n21,508\n \n$\n19,542\n \nProtection Services\n5,385\n \n5,150\n \nTotal\n$\n26,893\n \n$\n24,692\n \nProtection Services\n  For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $\n1.84\n billion of property and casualty insurance premiums for Protection Services that were included in the unearned premium balance as of December 31, 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $\n1.74\n billion of property and casualty insurance premiums for Protection Services that were included in the unearned premium balance as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company expects to recognize approximately $\n1.98\n billion, $\n1.48\n billion and $\n1.93\n billion of the December 31, 2024 unearned premium balance in 2025, 2026 and thereafter, respectively.\nHealth and benefits\n  Voluntary accident and health insurance products are expected to remain in force for an extended period and therefore are primarily classified as long-duration contracts. Traditional life insurance products consist principally of products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, primarily term and whole life insurance products. Premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when due \n100      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nfrom policyholders, net of any credit loss allowance for uncollectible premiums. Benefits are reflected in accident, health and other policy benefits and recognized as incurred.\nInterest-sensitive life contracts, such as universal life, are insurance contracts whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed. The terms that may be changed include premiums paid by the contractholder, interest credited to the contractholder account balance and contract charges assessed against the contractholder account balance. Premiums from these contracts are reported as contractholder fund deposits. Contract charges consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account balance for the cost of insurance (mortality risk), contract administration and surrender of the contract prior to contractually specified dates. These contract charges are recognized as revenue when assessed against the contractholder account balance. Benefit payments in excess of the contractholder account balance are reflected in accident, health and other policy benefits.\nInterest credited to contractholder funds, which are reported in accident, health and other policy benefits, represents interest accrued or paid on interest-sensitive life contracts. Crediting rates for interest-sensitive life contracts are adjusted periodically by the Company to reflect current market conditions subject to contractually guaranteed minimum rates. \nAs of December 31, 2024, voluntary accident and health insurance and traditional life insurance products within the employer voluntary benefits business and all interest-sensitive life contracts are reported as held for sale.\nPremium installment receivables\n represent premiums written and not yet collected, net of the credit loss allowance for uncollectible premiums. These receivables are primarily outstanding for one year or less. The Company utilizes historical internal data including aging analyses to estimate allowances under current business conditions and for the forecast period. The Company regularly evaluates and updates the data and adjusts its allowance as appropriate.\nRollforward of credit loss allowance for premium installment receivables\nFor the years ended December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nBeginning balance\n$\n(\n138\n)\n$\n(\n132\n)\nIncrease in the provision for credit losses\n(\n414\n)\n(\n348\n)\nWrite-off of uncollectible premium installment receivable amounts \n(1)\n365\n \n342\n \nEnding balance\n$\n(\n187\n)\n$\n(\n138\n)\n(1)\nRepresents the portion of allowance that is reversed when premiums receivable are written off.\n \nOther revenue\nOther revenue represents fees collected from policyholders relating to premium installment payments, fees for servicing assigned risk business collected from other insurance carriers, commissions on sales of non-proprietary products, sales of identity protection services, fee-based services and other revenue transactions. Other revenue is recognized when performance obligations are fulfilled. \nThe Company collects service fees in the form of commission and general agent fees by selling policies issued by third-party insurance companies. The Company recognizes Medicare-related and other accident and health commission revenues equal to the estimated lifetime value of the revenues at the time when the policy is sold, net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations, as no further performance obligations exist. The allowance for estimated third-party cancellations is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary.\n \nDeferred policy acquisition costs\nDeferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”) are related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts and are deferred and recognized as an expense over the life of the related contracts. These costs are principally agent, employee and broker remuneration, premium taxes and certain underwriting expenses and are included in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All other acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and included in operating costs and expenses.\nCustomers of the Company may exchange one insurance policy for another offered by the Company, or make modifications to an existing life, accident and health or property and casualty contract issued by the Company. These transactions are identified as internal replacements for accounting purposes. Internal replacement transactions determined to result in replacement contracts that are substantially unchanged from the replaced contracts are accounted for as continuations of the replaced contracts. Unamortized DAC related to the replaced contracts continue to be deferred and amortized in connection with the replacement contracts. For traditional life, accident and health and property and casualty insurance policies, any changes to unamortized DAC that result from replacement contracts are treated as prospective revisions and any costs associated with the issuance of replacement contracts are characterized as maintenance costs and expensed as incurred.\nProperty and casualty insurance \n For personal lines, DAC is amortized into income as premiums are earned pro rata over the period of the policy. For protection plans, vehicle service contracts and other insurance contracts, DAC is amortized into income over the term of the contract based on the percentage of the contract’s total revenue recognized during the period. DAC is periodically reviewed for recoverability \nThe Allstate Corporation      101\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nand adjusted if necessary. Future investment income is considered in determining the recoverability of DAC. \nLong-duration voluntary accident and health insurance, traditional life insurance contracts, and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts  \nVoluntary accident and health insurance and traditional life insurance contracts are grouped by product and issue year into cohorts consistent with the cohorts used to calculate the reserve for future policy benefits (“RFPB”). Interest-sensitive life insurance contracts are grouped into cohorts by issue year, and the issue year is determined based on contract issue date. DAC is amortized on a constant level basis over the expected contract term. The constant level basis used for all cohorts is based on policies in force. The expected contract term and mortality, morbidity, and lapse assumptions are used to calculate both DAC amortization and the RFPB. If actual contract lapses are greater than expected lapses for any cohort, each affected cohort’s DAC balance will be reduced in the current period based on the difference between the actual and expected lapses. No adjustments to DAC amortization are recorded if actual contract lapses are less than expected lapses for any cohort. If the Company makes an update to any of its mortality, morbidity, or lapse assumptions, the Company will use the assumptions prospectively to amortize any cohort’s remaining DAC over the remaining expected contract term.\nAs of December 31, 2024, long-duration voluntary accident and health insurance and traditional life insurance contracts within the employer voluntary benefits business, all interest-sensitive life insurance contracts and the associated DAC are reported as held for sale.\nReinsurance and indemnification \nReinsurance\n  In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to limit aggregate and single exposure to losses on large risks by purchasing reinsurance. The Company has also used reinsurance to affect the disposition of certain blocks of business. Reinsurance does not extinguish the Company’s primary liability under the policies written. Therefore, in addition to establishing allowances as appropriate after evaluating reinsurers’ activities related to claims settlement practices and commutations, the Company evaluates reinsurer counterparty credit risk and records reinsurance recoverables net of credit loss allowances. The Company assesses counterparty credit risk for individual reinsurers separately when more relevant or on a pooled basis when shared risk characteristics exist. The evaluation considers the credit quality of the reinsurer and the period over which the recoverable balances are expected to be collected. The Company considers factors including past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts in the development of the estimate of credit loss allowances. \nAllowances for property and casualty and accident and health reinsurance recoverables are established primarily through risk-based evaluations.\nThe property and casualty recoverable evaluation considers the credit rating of the reinsurer, the period over which the reinsurance recoverable balances are expected to be recovered and other relevant factors including historical experience of reinsurer failures. Reinsurers in liquidation or in default status are evaluated individually using the Company’s historical liquidation recovery assumptions and any other relevant information available including the most recent public information related to the financial condition or liquidation status of the reinsurer.   \nThe Company monitors the credit ratings of reinsurer counterparties and evaluates the circumstances surrounding credit rating changes as inputs into its credit loss assessments. Uncollectible reinsurance recoverable balances are written off against the allowances when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n The changes in the allowances are reported in property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense and accident, health and other policy benefits.\nIndemnification\n  The Company also participates in various indemnification programs, including industry pools and facilities, which are reimbursement mechanisms that assess participating insurers for expected insured claims, reimburse participating insurers for qualifying paid claims and permit participating insurers to recoup amounts assessed directly from insureds. Indemnification recoverables are backed by the financial resources of the property and casualty insurance company market participants.\nThe design and function of these indemnification programs does not result in the retention of insurance or reinsurance risk by the indemnitee. Based on the Company’s evaluation of these programs on an individual basis, the establishment of credit loss allowances is not warranted at this time. The Company has not experienced any historical credit losses related to its indemnification programs. The Company continues to monitor these programs to determine whether any changes from historical experience have emerged or are expected to emerge or whether there have been any changes in the design or administration of the programs that would require establishment of credit loss allowances. \nRevenue recognition\n  The amounts reported as reinsurance and indemnification recoverables include amounts paid and due from reinsurers and indemnitors as well as estimates of amounts expected to be recovered from reinsurers and indemnitors on insurance liabilities that have been incurred but not yet paid. Reinsurance and indemnification recoverables on unpaid losses are estimated based upon assumptions consistent with those used in establishing the liabilities related to the underlying contract. Reinsurance and indemnification premiums are generally reflected in income in a manner consistent with the recognition of premiums on the associated contracts. For catastrophe coverage, the cost of reinsurance premiums is recognized ratably over the contract period to the extent coverage remains available. Certain catastrophe agreements are subject to \n102      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nreinstatement premiums which are recognized in the same period as the loss event that gave rise to the reinstatement premiums.\n \nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired, less any impairment of goodwill recognized. \nThe Company’s goodwill reporting units are equivalent to its reportable segments to which goodwill has been assigned: Allstate Protection, Protection Services, and Allstate Health and Benefits.\nGoodwill by reporting unit\nDecember 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nAllstate Protection\n$\n1,563\n \n$\n1,563\n \nProtection Services\n1,511\n \n1,494\n \nAllstate Health and Benefits\n171\n \n445\n \nTotal\n$\n3,245\n \n$\n3,502\n \nGoodwill is recognized when acquired and allocated to reporting units based on which unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year based upon data as of the close of the third quarter. Goodwill impairment is measured and recognized as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company also reviews goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as deteriorating or adverse market conditions, indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill may exceed the fair value of the reporting unit. The goodwill impairment analysis is performed at the reporting unit level.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company’s goodwill reporting units exceeded their carrying values. The decrease compared to December 31, 2023 was related to the reclassification of goodwill as held for sale as of December 31, 2024 due to the pending sale of the employer voluntary benefits business partially offset by the addition of goodwill related to Allstate Protection Plans’ acquisition of Kingfisher to enhance its mobile protection offerings.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets (reported in other assets) consist of capitalized costs primarily related to acquired distribution and customer relationships, trade names and licenses, technology and other assets. The estimated useful lives of distribution, customer relationships and technology and other intangible assets are generally \n5\n years, \n10\n years, and \n5\n years, respectively. \nIntangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. \nIntangible assets by type\nDecember 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nDistribution and customer relationships\n$\n367\n \n$\n515\n \nTrade names and licenses \n(1)\n \n145\n \n159\n \nTechnology and other\n242\n \n292\n \nTotal\n$\n754\n \n$\n966\n \n(1)\nIncludes finite-lived trade names with carrying values of $\n7\n million and $\n21\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are expected to be fully amortized by the end of 2025.\nAmortization expense is calculated using an accelerated amortization method.\n Amortization expense on intangible assets was $\n280\n million, $\n329\n million and $\n353\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAmortization expense of intangible assets for the next five years and thereafter\n($ in millions)\n2025\n$\n230\n \n2026\n161\n \n2027\n112\n \n2028\n67\n \n2029\n32\n \nThereafter\n14\n \nTotal amortization\n$\n616\n \nAccumulated amortization of intangible assets was $\n1.66\n billion and $\n1.80\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nTrade names and licenses are considered to have an indefinite useful life and are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequent if circumstances arise that indicate an impairment may have occurred. An impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.\nAcquisition earn-out payables\nThe fair value of contingent consideration arrangements such as earn-out purchase arrangements at the acquisition date, are included in the purchase price consideration. The recorded purchase price for acquisitions includes an estimate of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. Subsequent changes in these earn-out obligations will be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when incurred or reasonably estimated. Estimates of potential earn-out obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities, usually for periods up to five years. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum future contingency payments related to acquisitions totaled $\n25\n million.\nIn addition, the Company provides contingent bonus payments to certain eligible employees of acquired operations or entities based on the same timeframe and future earnings as used in determining the contingent consideration arrangement.\nThe Allstate Corporation      103\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Included in property and equipment are capitalized costs related to computer software licenses and software developed for internal use of $\n398\n million and $\n545\n million, net of accumulated depreciation, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These costs generally consist of certain external and payroll related costs. Property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally \n3\n to \n10\n years for equipment, \n3\n to \n5\n years for computer software licenses and software developed for internal use and \n40\n years for real property. Depreciation expense is reported in operating costs and expenses.\nAccumulated depreciation on property and equipment was $\n2.50\n billion and $\n2.59\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $\n316\n million, $\n343\n million and $\n335\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company reviews its property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. The Company recognizes interest expense related to income tax matters in income tax expense and penalties in operating costs and expenses.\nReserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense\nThe reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense is the estimate of amounts necessary to settle all reported and unreported incurred claims for the ultimate cost of insured property and casualty losses, based upon the facts of each case and the Company’s experience with similar cases. Estimated amounts of salvage and subrogation are deducted from the reserve for claims and claims expense. The establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophe losses, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. Reserve estimates are primarily derived using an actuarial estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters) for an accident or report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. Development factors are calculated quarterly and periodically throughout the year for data elements such as claims reported and settled, paid losses, and paid losses combined with case reserves. \nWhen the Company experiences changes in the mix or type of claims or changing claim settlement \npatterns or data, it applies actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors to develop reserve liabilities. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process as a development factor using historic data incorporated as a reasonable estimate of future inflation. The historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates, including the reserves for reported and unreported claims; however, when the Company experiences changes, it may lead to historical development trends being less predictive of future loss development, potentially creating additional reserve variability. Reserve estimates are regularly reviewed and updated, using the most current data and information available. Any resulting reestimates are reflected in current results of operations.\nReserve for future policy benefits\nLong-duration voluntary accident and health insurance and traditional life insurance contracts  \nThe RFPB is calculated using the net premium reserving model, which uses the present value of insurance contract benefits less the present value of net premiums. Under the net premium reserving model, the Company computes a net premium ratio which is the present value of insurance contract benefits divided by the present value of gross premiums. The present value of contract benefits and gross premiums are determined using the discount rate at contract inception. The net premium ratio is applied to premiums due on a periodic basis to compute the RFPB. The net premium ratio is recomputed at least annually using both actual historical cash flows and future cash flows anticipated over the life of the cohort of contracts subject to measurement. Assumptions including mortality, morbidity, and lapses affect the timing and amount of estimated cash flows used to calculate the RFPB.\nThe Company has grouped contracts into cohorts based on product type and issue year. Issue year is based on the issuance date of the contract to the policyholder, except in the case of contracts acquired in a business combination, where the issue date is based on the acquisition date of the business combination. The RFPB is calculated for contracts in force at the end of each period, which results in the Company recognizing the effects of actual experience in the period it occurs.\nAnnually, in the third quarter, the Company obtains historical premiums and benefits information and evaluates future cash flow assumptions that include mortality, morbidity, and lapses, and updates cash flow assumptions as necessary. The Company has elected to not update the expense assumption when annually reviewing and updating future cash flow assumptions. Actual premiums and benefits and any updates to future cash flow assumptions are incorporated into the calculation of an updated net premium ratio. Updates for actual premiums and benefits and changes to future cash flow assumptions will result in a liability remeasurement gain or loss. The decrease (gain) or increase (loss) in the RFPB is reported as liability \n104      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nremeasurement gain or loss in net income and presented parenthetically as part of accident, health and other policy benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The updated net premium ratio is used in future quarters to measure the RFPB until the next annual update or an earlier date if the Company determines it is necessary to revise future cash flow assumptions based on available evidence, including actual experience\n.\nThe discount rate assumption is determined using a yield curve approach. The yield curve consists of U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured fixed-income securities issued by U.S. companies that have an A credit rating based on the ratings provided by nationally recognized rating agencies that include Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. For points on the yield curve that do not have observable yields, the Company uses linear interpolation\n w\nhich calculates the unobservable yield based on the two nearest observable yields, except for any points beyond the last observable yield at 30 years, where interest rates are held constant with the last observable point on the yield curve. The Company updates the current discount rate quarterly and the change in the RFPB resulting from the updated current discount rate is recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”).\nAccident and health short-duration contracts  \nThe RFPB includes unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) reserves for individual and certain voluntary accident and health short-duration contracts and is an estimate of the Company’s liability from incurred claims at the end of the reporting period. The unpaid losses and LAE reserves are the result of an ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends and emerging historical experience. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims. In setting its reserves, the Company reviews its loss data to estimate expected loss development. Management believes that its use of standard actuarial methodology applied to its analyses of its historical experience provides a reasonable estimate of future losses. However, actual future losses may differ from the Company’s estimate, and may be affected by future events, including inflation and changes in law and judicial interpretations, which would favorably or unfavorably impact the ultimate settlement of the Company’s losses and LAE.\nThe anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and LAE. In addition to inflation, the average severity of claims is affected by a number of factors that may vary by types and features of policies written. Future average severities are projected from historical trends, adjusted for implemented changes in underwriting standards and policy provisions, as well as general economic trends. These estimated trends are monitored and revised as necessary based on actual development.\nUnpaid losses include a provision for incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserve estimates representing claims that have occurred but have not yet been \nreported, some of which are not yet known to the insured, as well as a provision for future development on reported claims. IBNR reserves are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses. Reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves.\nAs of December 31, 2024, voluntary accident and health insurance and traditional life insurance products within the employer voluntary benefits business are reported as held for sale.\nContractholder funds\nContractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising primarily from the sale of interest-sensitive life insurance contracts. Contractholder funds primarily comprise cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract benefits, surrenders, withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2024, all contractholder funds are reported as held for sale.\nPension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses\nThe Company’s policy is to remeasure its pension and postretirement plans on a quarterly basis. Pension and other postretirement gains and losses represent the remeasurement of projected benefit obligations and differences between the expected and actual return on plan assets, which are immediately recognized in earnings and are referred to as pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nThe primary factors contributing to pension and postretirement remeasurement gains and losses are:\n•\n \nChanges in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement obligations as of the measurement date\n•  \nDifferences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets\n•\n \nChanges in demographic assumptions, including mortality and participant experience\n•\n \nChanges in lump sum interest rates and cash balance interest crediting rates used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date\nDifferences in actual experience and changes in other assumptions affect the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations and expenses. \nPension and other postretirement service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credits are allocated to the Company’s reportable segments. The pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses are reported in the Corporate and Other segment.\n \nLegal contingencies\nThe Company reviews its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis. The Company establishes accruals for such matters at management’s best estimate when the \nThe Allstate Corporation      105\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCompany assesses that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company’s assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals. The Company does not include potential recoveries in its estimates of reasonably possible or probable losses. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nEquity incentive plans\nThe Company has equity incentive plans under which it grants nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock awards (“equity awards”) to certain employees and directors of the Company. The Company measures the fair value of equity awards at the grant date and recognizes the expense over the shorter of the period in which the requisite service is rendered or retirement eligibility is attained. The expense for performance stock awards with no market condition is adjusted each period to reflect the performance factor most likely to be achieved at the end of the performance period. The expense for performance stock awards with a market condition is based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date which incorporates the probability of achieving the market condition. In the event the market condition is not met, any previously recognized expense is not reversed. The Company uses a binomial \nlattice model to determine the fair value of employee stock options. The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of performance stock awards with a market condition.\nMeasurement of credit losses\nThe Company carries an allowance for expected credit losses for all financial assets measured at amortized cost on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company considers past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating an allowance for credit losses. The Company also carries a credit loss allowance for fixed income securities where applicable and, when amortized cost is reported, it is net of credit loss allowances. For additional information, refer to the Investments, Recognition of premium revenues and contract charges or Reinsurance and indemnification topics of this section.\nThe Company also estimates a credit loss allowance for its line of credit with Adirondack Insurance Exchange (“Adirondack”) and commitments to fund mortgage loans and bank loans unless they are unconditionally cancellable by the Company.

The Company consolidates VIEs in which the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (1) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE and (2) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect that entity’s economic performance.\nForeign currency translation\nThe local currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is deemed to be the functional currency of the country in which these subsidiaries operate. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates during the period for results of operations.\nThe unrealized gains and losses from the translation of the net assets are recorded as unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments and included in AOCI. Changes in unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments are included in OCI. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in operating costs and expenses and have not been material.\n106      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nAdopted accounting standard\nSegment reporting\n  Effective December 31, 2024, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance expanding segment disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of reportable segments’ profit or loss and assets. The guidance affects disclosures only.\nPending accounting standards\nAccounting for joint ventures\n  In August 2023, the FASB issued guidance requiring a joint venture to initially measure assets contributed and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the formation date. The new guidance will be applied prospectively for joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. The impact of the adoption is not expected to be material to the Company’s results of operations or financial position.\nIncome tax disclosures\n  In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance enhancing various aspects of income tax disclosures. The guidance requires a tabular reconciliation between statutory and effective income tax expense (benefit) with both amounts and percentages for a list of required categories. For certain required categories where an individual category is at least five percent of the statutory tax amount, the required category must be further broken out by nature and, for foreign tax effects, jurisdiction. Additionally, entities must disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received, broken out between federal, state and foreign, and amounts paid, net of refunds received, to an individual jurisdiction when five percent or more of the total income taxes paid, net of refunds received. \nAll requirements in the guidance are annual in nature, and the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The guidance only affects disclosures and will have no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \nClimate disclosures\n  In March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted a final rule requiring registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The rule requires the disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information, with certain information, such as financial statement effects of severe weather events, included in the notes to the audited financial statements. Other disclosure requirements include material climate-related risks, processes to manage and govern those risks, disclosure of targets if the targets materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, and, if material, disclosure of certain greenhouse gas emissions. On April 4, 2024, the SEC issued a voluntary stay of the final rule, awaiting the outcome of pending litigation. In February 2025, the SEC requested that the court not schedule the case for argument to provide time for the SEC to deliberate and determine next steps. The Company is currently monitoring the status of the final rule. \nDisaggregated income statement disclosures \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance requiring disaggregated information about specific expense categories included in certain income statement expense line items and disclosures about selling expenses. \nThe new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The standard is effective on a prospective basis, with the option for retrospective application. The guidance only affects disclosures and will have no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Allstate Corporation      107\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 3\nEarnings per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including vested unissued participating restricted stock units. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding.\nDilutive potential common shares consist of outstanding stock options and unvested non-participating restricted stock units and contingently issuable performance stock awards. The effect of dilutive potential common shares does not include options with an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common share because their exercise prices exceed the average market price of Allstate common shares during the period or for which the unrecognized compensation cost would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nComputation of basic and diluted earnings per common share\nFor the years ended December 31,\n(In millions, except per share data)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss)\n$\n4,599\n \n$\n(\n213\n)\n$\n(\n1,342\n)\nLess: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest\n(\n68\n)\n(\n25\n)\n(\n53\n)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Allstate\n4,667\n \n(\n188\n)\n(\n1,289\n)\nLess: Preferred stock dividends\n117\n \n128\n \n105\n \nNet income (loss) applicable to common shareholders\n$\n4,550\n \n$\n(\n316\n)\n$\n(\n1,394\n)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\n264.3\n \n262.5\n \n271.2\n \nEffect of dilutive potential common shares \n(1)\n:\nStock options\n2.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \nRestricted stock units (non-participating) and performance stock awards\n0.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \nWeighted average common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding\n267.8\n \n262.5\n \n271.2\n \nNet income (loss) applicable to common shareholders per common share - Basic\n$\n17.22\n \n$\n(\n1.20\n)\n$\n(\n5.14\n)\nNet income (loss) applicable to common shareholders per common share - Diluted \n(1)\n$\n16.99\n \n$\n(\n1.20\n)\n$\n(\n5.14\n)\nAnti-dilutive options excluded from diluted earnings per common share\n0.5\n \n3.0\n \n1.7\n \nWeighted average dilutive potential common shares excluded due to net loss applicable to common shareholders \n(1)\n—\n \n2.2\n \n3.1\n \n(1)\nAs a result of the net loss reported for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, weighted average shares for basic earnings per share is also used for calculating diluted earnings per share because all dilutive potential common shares are anti-dilutive and are therefore excluded from the calculation.\nNote 4\nDisposition\nOn August 13, 2024, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with StanCorp Financial Group, Inc. to sell American Heritage Life Insurance Company and American Heritage Service Company, comprising the Company’s employer voluntary benefits business for approximately $\n2.0\n billion in cash. The employer voluntary benefits business (“EVB”) is reported in the Allstate Health and Benefits segment, and beginning in the third quarter of 2024, the assets and liabilities of the business were classified as held for sale. \nThe transaction price less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value of the net assets related to this transaction, resulting in an estimated gain that will be recognized at closing of the transaction. The anticipated gain on the sale will be impacted by purchase price adjustments associated with certain pre-close transactions, changes in the carrying value of \nnet assets, changes in accumulated other comprehensive income and the related tax effects. \nThe amount of goodwill included in the carrying value is based on the relative fair value of the EVB business to the fair value of the Allstate Health and Benefits segment and is reported in other assets in the table below. \nThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nThe EVB business generated $\n985\n million of premiums and contract charges and adjusted net income of $\n85\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n108      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nMajor classes of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale\n($ in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nAssets\nInvestments\nFixed income securities, at fair value (amortized cost, net $\n1,809\n)\n$\n1,699\n \nShort-term, at fair value (amortized cost $\n85\n)\n85\n \nOther investments, net\n122\n \nTotal investments\n1,906\n \nDeferred policy acquisitions costs\n521\n \nReinsurance recoverables, net\n111\n \nOther assets\n554\n \nTotal assets held for sale\n$\n3,092\n \nLiabilities\nReserve for future policy benefits\n$\n1,085\n \nContractholder funds\n890\n \nOther liabilities and accrued expenses\n138\n \nTotal liabilities held for sale\n$\n2,113\n \nIncluded in shareholders' equity is $\n72\n million of accumulated other comprehensive loss related to assets and liabilities held for sale.\nNote 5\nReportable Segments\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the CODM. The CODM reviews financial performance and makes decisions about the allocation of resources for the \nfive\n reportable segments. The CODM considers each segment profit measure when making decisions regarding the allocation of resources to the segments. \nAllstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability segments comprise Property-Liability. The Company does not allocate investment income, net gains and losses on investments and derivatives or assets to the Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability segments. Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability, Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits, and Corporate and Other levels for decision-making purposes. These segments are described below and align with the Company’s key product and service offerings.\nThe accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2. The effects of inter-segment transactions are eliminated in the consolidated results. For segment results, services provided by Protection Services to Allstate Protection are not eliminated as management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments.\nAllstate Protection\n principally offers private passenger auto, homeowners and other property insurance in the United States and Canada, with earned premiums accounting for \n84.0\n% of Allstate’s 2024 consolidated revenues. Allstate Protection primarily operates in the U.S. (all \n50\n states and the District of Columbia (“D.C.”)) and Canada. For 2024, the top geographic locations for statutory direct premiums for the Allstate Protection segment were Texas, California, Florida and New York. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than \n5\n% of statutory direct premiums for Allstate Protection. Revenues from \nexternal customers generated outside the United States were $\n2.14\n billion, $\n2.06\n billion and $\n1.94\n billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nRun-off Property-Liability \nincludes results from property and casualty insurance coverage that primarily relates to policies written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other run-off lines claims arises principally from direct excess commercial insurance, assumed reinsurance coverage, direct primary commercial insurance and other businesses in run-off.\nProtection Services\n comprises Allstate Protection Plans, Allstate Dealer Services, Allstate Roadside, Arity and Allstate Identity Protection. Protection Services offers consumer product protection plans, automotive protection and insurance products (including vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection, road hazard tire and wheel and paintless dent repair protection), roadside assistance, mobility data collection services and analytic solutions using automotive telematics information and identity theft protection and remediation services. Protection Services primarily operates in the U.S. and Canada, with Allstate Protection Plans also offering services in Europe, Asia and Australia. Revenues from external customers generated outside the United States were $\n472\n million, $\n346\n million and $\n258\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and relate to consumer product protection plans sold primarily in Europe, Japan and Australia.\nAllstate Health and Benefits\n offers employer voluntary benefits, group health and individual health products, including life, accident, critical illness, hospital indemnity, short-term disability and other health products. Allstate Health and Benefits primarily operates in the U.S. (all \n50\n states and D.C.) and Canada. For 2024, the top geographic locations for statutory \nThe Allstate Corporation      109\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ndirect accident, health and life insurance premiums were Texas, Florida, Georgia and Ohio. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than \n5\n% of statutory direct accident, health and life insurance premiums. Revenues from external customers generated outside the United States relate to voluntary accident and health insurance sold in Canada and were not material.\nOn August 13, 2024, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with StanCorp Financial Group, Inc. to sell the Company’s employer voluntary benefits business. See Note 4 for additional information on the transaction.\n On January 30, 2025, the Company entered into an agreement with Nationwide Life Insurance Company to sell the Company’s group health business. The transaction is expected to close during 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. \nCorporate and Other\n comprises net investment income, net gains (losses) on investments, other revenue, debt service, other holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations. \nMeasuring segment profit or loss\nThe measure of segment profit or loss used in evaluating performance is underwriting income for the Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability \nsegments and adjusted net income for the Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits and Corporate and Other segments.\nUnderwriting income (loss)\n is calculated as premiums earned and other revenue, less claims and claims expenses, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.\nAdjusted net income (loss)\n is net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders, excluding:\n•\nNet gains and losses on investments and derivatives\n•\nPension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses\n•\nAmortization or impairment of purchased intangibles\n•\nGain or loss on disposition\n•\nAdjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years\n•\nIncome tax expense or benefit on reconciling items\nA reconciliation of these measures to net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders is provided below.\nReportable segments financial performance\nFor the years ended December 31,\n($ in

If a security meets either of these criteria, any existing credit loss allowance would be written-off against the amortized cost basis of the asset along with any remaining unrealized losses, with incremental losses recorded in earnings.\nIf the Company has not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company evaluates whether it expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company calculates the estimated recovery value based on the best estimate of future cash flows considering past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The estimated future cash flows are discounted at the security’s current effective rate and is compared to the amortized cost of the security.\nThe determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective, and methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security. All reasonably available information relevant to the collectability of the security is considered when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. That information generally includes, but is not limited to, the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer, expected defaults, expected recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, origination vintage year, geographic concentration of underlying collateral, available reserves or escrows, current subordination levels, third-party guarantees and other credit enhancements. Other information, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, credit ratings and other market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows, may also be considered. The estimated fair value of collateral will be used to estimate recovery value if the Company determines that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement.\nIf the Company does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income security, a credit loss allowance is recorded in earnings for the shortfall in expected cash flows; however, the amortized cost, net of the credit loss allowance, may not be lower than the fair value of the security. The portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit remains classified in AOCI. If the Company determines that the fixed income security does not have sufficient cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery value for the security, the Company may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded in earnings.\nWhen a security is sold or otherwise disposed or when the security is deemed uncollectible and written off, the Company reduces the credit loss allowance. Recoveries after write-offs are recognized when received. \nAccrued interest excluded from the amortized cost of fixed income securities totaled $\n574\n million and $\n495\n million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and is reported within the accrued investment income line of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company monitors accrued interest and writes off amounts when they are not expected to be received.\nThe Company’s portfolio monitoring process includes a quarterly review of all securities to identify instances where the fair value of a security compared to its amortized cost is below internally established thresholds. The process also includes the monitoring of other credit loss indicators such as ratings, ratings downgrades and payment defaults. The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which the Company may have a concern, are evaluated for potential credit losses using all reasonably available information relevant to the collectability or recovery of the security. Inherent in the Company’s evaluation of credit losses for these securities are assumptions and estimates about the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer. Some of the factors that may be considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value requires a credit loss allowance are: 1) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer, including relevant industry specific market conditions and trends, geographic location and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; 2) the specific reasons that a security is in an unrealized loss position, including overall market conditions which could affect liquidity; and 3) the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost.\nThe Allstate Corporation      119\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRollforward of credit loss allowance for fixed income securities\nFor the years ended December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n(\n36\n)\n$\n(\n13\n)\n$\n(\n6\n)\nCredit losses on securities for which credit losses not previously reported\n(\n8\n)\n(\n11\n)\n(\n1\n)\nNet decreases (increases) related to credit losses previously reported\n2\n \n(\n11\n)\n(\n6\n)\nDecrease (increase) related to sales and other\n3\n \n(\n1\n)\n—\n \nWrite-offs\n22\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEnding balance\n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n(\n36\n)\n$\n(\n13\n)\nComponents of credit loss allowance as of December 31\nCorporate bonds\n(\n16\n)\n(\n35\n)\n(\n11\n)\nABS\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n(\n36\n)\n$\n(\n13\n)\nGross unrealized losses and fair value by type and length of time held in a continuous unrealized loss position\n (1)\nLess than 12 months\n12 months or more\n($ in millions)\nNumber of issues\nFair value\nUnrealized losses\nNumber of issues\nFair value\nUnrealized losses\nTotal unrealized losses\nDecember 31, 2024\nFixed income securities\nU.S. government and agencies\n179\n \n$\n8,520\n \n$\n(\n256\n)\n99\n \n$\n801\n \n$\n(\n74\n)\n$\n(\n330\n)\nMunicipal\n990\n \n4,889\n \n(\n67\n)\n1,089\n \n1,693\n \n(\n109\n)\n(\n176\n)\nCorporate\n943\n \n9,178\n \n(\n166\n)\n1,237\n \n7,877\n \n(\n544\n)\n(\n710\n)\nForeign government\n42\n \n159\n \n(\n2\n)\n73\n \n73\n \n(\n8\n)\n(\n10\n)\nABS\n50\n \n78\n \n—\n \n85\n \n56\n \n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\nTotal fixed income securities\n2,204\n \n$\n22,824\n \n$\n(\n491\n)\n2,583\n \n$\n10,500\n \n$\n(\n739\n)\n$\n(\n1,230\n)\nInvestment grade fixed income securities\n2,002\n \n$\n21,846\n \n$\n(\n473\n)\n2,367\n \n$\n9,281\n \n$\n(\n655\n)\n$\n(\n1,128\n)\nBelow investment grade fixed income securities\n202\n \n978\n \n(\n18\n)\n216\n \n1,219\n \n(\n84\n)\n(\n102\n)\nTotal fixed income securities\n2,204\n \n$\n22,824\n \n$\n(\n491\n)\n2,583\n \n$\n10,500\n \n$\n(\n739\n)\n$\n(\n1,230\n)\nDecember 31, 2023\nFixed income securities\nU.S. government and agencies\n63\n \n$\n2,554\n \n$\n(\n38\n)\n117\n \n$\n2,513\n \n$\n(\n81\n)\n$\n(\n119\n)\nMunicipal\n271\n \n400\n \n(\n4\n)\n1,784\n \n2,245\n \n(\n148\n)\n(\n152\n)\nCorporate\n251\n \n2,225\n \n(\n48\n)\n2,106\n \n17,319\n \n(\n1,095\n)\n(\n1,143\n)\nForeign government\n7\n \n31\n \n—\n \n75\n \n356\n \n(\n13\n)\n(\n13\n)\nABS\n19\n \n64\n \n(\n1\n)\n150\n \n584\n \n(\n6\n)\n(\n7\n)\nTotal fixed income securities\n611\n \n$\n5,274\n \n$\n(\n91\n)\n4,232\n \n$\n23,017\n \n$\n(\n1,343\n)\n$\n(\n1,434\n)\nInvestment grade fixed income securities\n568\n \n$\n5,061\n \n$\n(\n83\n)\n3,864\n \n$\n20,429\n \n$\n(\n1,151\n)\n$\n(\n1,234\n)\nBelow investment grade fixed income securities\n43\n \n213\n \n(\n8\n)\n368\n \n2,588\n \n(\n192\n)\n(\n200\n)\nTotal fixed income securities\n611\n \n$\n5,274\n \n$\n(\n91\n)\n4,232\n \n$\n23,017\n \n$\n(\n1,343\n)\n$\n(\n1,434\n)\n(1)\nIncludes fixed income securities with fair values of $\n16\n million and $\n32\n million and unrealized losses of $\n1\n million and $\n3\n million with credit loss allowances of $\n3\n million and $\n8\n million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nGross unrealized losses by unrealized loss position and credit quality as of December 31, 2024\n($ in millions)\nInvestment \ngrade\nBelow investment grade\nTotal\nFixed income securities with unrealized loss position less than 20% of amortized cost, net \n(1) \n$\n(\n1,092\n)\n$\n(\n100\n)\n$\n(\n1,192\n)\nFixed income securities with unrealized loss position greater than or equal to 20% of amortized cost, net \n(2)\n(\n36\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n38\n)\nTotal unrealized losses\n$\n(\n1,128\n)\n$\n(\n102\n)\n$\n(\n1,230\n)\n(1)\nRelated to securities with an unrealized loss position less than 20% of amortized cost, net, the degree of which suggests that these securities do not pose a high risk of having credit losses.\n(2)\nEvaluated based on factors such as discounted cash flows and the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer and were determined to have adequate resources to fulfill contractual obligations.\n120      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nInvestment grade is defined as a security having a National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) designation of 1 or 2, which is comparable to a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moody’s or AAA, AA, A or BBB from S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”), or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available. Market prices for certain securities may have credit spreads which imply higher or lower credit quality than the current third-party rating. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities are principally related to an increase in market yields which may include increased risk-free interest rates or wider credit spreads since the time of initial purchase. The unrealized losses are expected to reverse as the securities approach maturity. \nABS in an unrealized loss position were evaluated based on actual and projected collateral losses relative to the securities’ positions in the respective securitization trusts, security specific expectations of cash flows, and credit ratings. This evaluation also takes into consideration credit enhancement, measured in terms of (i) subordination from other classes of securities in the trust that are contractually obligated to absorb losses before the class of security the Company owns, and (ii) the expected impact of other structural features embedded in the securitization trust beneficial to the class of securities the Company owns, such as overcollateralization and excess spread. Municipal bonds in an unrealized loss position were evaluated based on the underlying credit quality of the primary obligor, obligation type and quality of the underlying assets.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has not made the decision to sell and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell fixed income securities with unrealized losses before recovery of the amortized cost basis.\nLoans\n \nThe Company establishes a credit loss allowance for mortgage loans and bank loans when they are originated or purchased, and for unfunded commitments unless they are unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The Company uses a probability of default and loss given default model for mortgage loans and bank loans to estimate current expected credit losses that considers all relevant information available including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts over the life of an asset. The Company also considers such factors as historical losses, expected prepayments and various economic factors. For mortgage loans, the Company considers origination vintage year and property level information such as debt service coverage, property type, property location and collateral value. For bank loans, the Company considers the credit rating of the borrower, credit spreads and type of loan. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company’s model reverts to historical loss trends.\nLoans are evaluated on a pooled basis when they share similar risk characteristics. The Company monitors loans through a quarterly credit monitoring process to determine when they no longer share similar risk characteristics and are to be evaluated individually when estimating credit losses. \nLoans are written off against their corresponding allowances when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. If a loan recovers after a write-off, the estimate of expected credit losses includes the expected recovery.\nAccrual of income is suspended for loans that are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not probable. Accrued income receivable is monitored for recoverability and when not expected to be collected is written off through net investment income. Cash receipts on loans on non-accrual status are generally recorded as a reduction of amortized cost.\nAccrued interest is excluded from the amortized cost of loans and is reported within the accrued investment income line of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Accrued interest as of 2024 and 2023 was not significant for bank loans or mortgage loans.\nMortgage loans\n \n When it is determined a mortgage loan shall be evaluated individually, the Company uses various methods to estimate credit losses on individual loans such as using collateral value less estimated costs to sell where applicable, including when foreclosure is probable or when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. When collateral value is used, the mortgage loans may not have a credit loss allowance when the fair value of the collateral exceeds the loan’s amortized cost. An alternative approach may be utilized to estimate credit losses using the present value of the loan’s expected future repayment cash flows discounted at the loan’s current effective interest rate. \nIndividual loan credit loss allowances are adjusted for subsequent changes in the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell, when applicable, or present value of the loan’s expected future repayment cash flows.\nDebt service coverage ratio is considered a key credit quality indicator when commercial mortgage loan credit loss allowances are estimated. Debt service coverage ratio represents the amount of estimated cash flow from the property available to the borrower to meet principal and interest payment obligations. Debt service coverage ratio estimates are updated annually or more frequently if conditions are warranted based on the Company’s credit monitoring process.\nThe Allstate Corporation      121\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCommercial mortgage loans amortized cost by debt service coverage ratio distribution and year of origination \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n($ in millions)\n2019 and prior\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nTotal\nTotal\nBelow 1.0\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n13\n \n1.0 - 1.25\n59\n \n—\n \n—\n \n18\n \n25\n \n35\n \n137\n \n41\n \n1.26 - 1.50\n47\n \n10\n \n—\n \n30\n \n18\n \n—\n \n105\n \n133\n \nAbove 1.50\n144\n \n42\n \n165\n \n42\n \n86\n \n14\n \n493\n \n646\n \nAmortized cost before allowance\n$\n250\n \n$\n52\n \n$\n165\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n129\n \n$\n49\n \n$\n735\n \n$\n833\n \nAllowance \n(\n12\n)\n(\n11\n)\nAmortized cost, net\n$\n723\n \n$\n822\n \nCommercial mortgage loans with a debt service coverage ratio below 1.0 that are not considered impaired primarily relate to instances where the borrower has the financial capacity to fund the revenue shortfalls from the properties for the foreseeable term, the decrease in cash flows from the properties is considered temporary, or there are other risk \nmitigating circumstances such as additional collateral, escrow balances or borrower guarantees. \nPayments on all mortgage loans were current as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nRollforward of credit loss allowance for mortgage loans \nFor the years ended December 31, \n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n(\n11\n)\n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n(\n6\n)\nNet increases related to credit losses\n(\n1\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n1\n)\nWrite-offs\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEnding balance\n$\n(\n12\n)\n$\n(\n11\n)\n$\n(\n7\n)\nBank loans\n \nWhen it is determined a bank loan shall be evaluated individually, the Company uses various methods to estimate credit losses on individual loans such as the present value of the loan’s expected future repayment cash flows discounted at the loan’s current effective interest rate.\nCredit ratings of the borrower are considered a key credit quality indicator when bank loan credit loss \nallowances are estimated.

The hierarchy for inputs used in determining fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Assets and liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value are categorized in the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\nLevel 1:\n    \nAssets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the Company can access.\nLevel 2:\n    Assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following:\n(a)\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\n(b)\nQuoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or\n(c)\nValuation models whose inputs are observable, directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3:\n    \nAssets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the assets and liabilities.\nThe availability of observable inputs varies by instrument. In situations where fair value is based on internally developed pricing models or inputs that are unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is typically greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. In many instances, valuation inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The category level in the fair value hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market disruption. In periods of market disruption, the ability to observe prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments.\nThe Company is responsible for the determination of fair value and the supporting assumptions and methodologies. The Company gains assurance that assets and liabilities are appropriately valued through the execution of various processes and controls designed to ensure the overall reasonableness and consistent application of valuation methodologies, including inputs and assumptions, and compliance with \naccounting standards. For fair values received from third parties or internally estimated, the Company’s processes and controls are designed to ensure that the valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistently applied, the inputs and assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value, and the fair values are accurately recorded. For example, on a continuing basis, the Company assesses the reasonableness of individual fair values that have stale security prices or that exceed certain thresholds as compared to previous fair values received from valuation service providers or brokers or derived from internal models. The Company performs procedures to understand and assess the methodologies, processes and controls of valuation service providers. In addition, the Company may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from valuation service providers or brokers to other third-party valuation sources for selected securities. The Company performs ongoing price validation procedures such as back-testing of actual sales, which corroborate the various inputs used in internal models to market observable data. When fair value determinations are expected to be more variable, the Company validates them through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investment transactions.\nThe Company has two types of situations where investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy:\n(1)\nSpecific inputs significant to the fair value estimation models are not market observable. This primarily occurs in the Company’s use of broker quotes to value certain securities where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable, and the use of valuation models that use significant non-market observable inputs.\n(2)\nQuotes continue to be received from independent third-party valuation service providers and all significant inputs are market observable; however, there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared to normal market activity such that the degree of market observability has declined to a point where categorization as a Level 3 measurement is considered appropriate. The indicators considered in determining whether a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for a specific asset has occurred include the level of new issuances in the primary market, trading volume in the secondary market, the level of credit spreads over historical levels, applicable bid-ask spreads, and price consensus among market participants and other pricing sources.\nCertain assets are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis, including mortgage loans, bank loans, real estate and policy loans and are only included in the fair value hierarchy disclosure when the individual investment is reported at fair value.\nThe Allstate Corporation      123\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn determining fair value, the Company principally uses the market approach which generally utilizes market transaction data for the same or similar instruments. To a lesser extent, the Company uses the income approach which involves determining fair values from discounted cash flow methodologies. For the majority of Level 2 and Level 3 valuations, a combination of the market and income approaches is used.\nSummary of significant inputs and valuation techniques for Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nLevel 2 measurements\n•\nFixed income securities:\nU.S. government and agencies, municipal, corporate - public and foreign government:\n The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads.\nCorporate - privately placed: \nPrivately placed securities are valued using a discounted cash flow model that is widely accepted in the financial services industry and uses market observable inputs and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. The primary inputs to the discounted cash flow model include an interest rate yield curve, as well as published credit spreads for similar assets in markets that are not active that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer.\nCorporate - privately placed also includes redeemable preferred stock that are valued using quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, underlying stock prices and credit spreads.\nABS:\n The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, collateral performance, and credit spreads. Certain ABS are valued based on non-binding broker quotes whose inputs have been corroborated to be market observable. Residential mortgage-backed securities, included in ABS, also use prepayment speeds as a primary input for valuation.\n•\nEquity securities:\n \nThe primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices or quoted net asset values for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active.\n•\nShort-term:\n \nThe primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads.\n•\nOther investments:\n \nFree-standing exchange listed derivatives that are not actively traded are valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active.\nOver-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, total return swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, certain options and certain credit default swaps, are valued using models that rely on inputs such as interest rate yield curves, implied volatilities, index price levels, currency rates, and credit spreads that are observable for substantially the full term of the contract. The valuation techniques underlying the models are widely accepted in the financial services industry and do not involve significant judgment.\n•\nAssets held for sale:\n Comprise U.S. government and agencies, municipal, corporate and MBS fixed income securities. The significant inputs and valuation techniques are based on the respective asset type as described above.\nLevel 3 measurements\n•\nFixed income securities:\nMunicipal:\n Comprise municipal bonds that are not rated by third-party credit rating agencies. The primary inputs to the valuation of these municipal bonds include quoted prices for identical or similar assets that are not market observable, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads. Also included are municipal bonds valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and municipal bonds in default valued based on the present value of expected cash flows. \nCorporate - public and privately placed: \nPrimarily valued using a discounted cash flow model that is widely accepted in the financial services industry using inputs that have not been corroborated to be market observable. In certain situations, non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable are used. Other inputs for corporate fixed income securities include expected cash flows, an interest rate yield curve, as well as published credit spreads for similar assets that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer.\nABS:\n The primary inputs to the valuation include expected cash flows, benchmark yields, collateral performance and credit spreads. Residential mortgage-backed securities, included in ABS, also use prepayment speeds as a primary input for valuation.\n•\nEquity securities:\n \nThe primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices or quoted net asset values for identical or similar assets that are not market observable.\n•\nShort-term:\n \nFor certain short-term investments, amortized cost is used as the best estimate of fair value.\n•\nOther investments:\n \nCertain options (including swaptions), are valued using models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry. These are categorized as Level 3 as a result of the significance of non-market observable inputs such \n124      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nas volatility. Other primary inputs include interest rate yield curves and quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that exhibit less liquidity relative to those markets supporting Level 2 fair value measurements. \n•\nOther assets:\n Includes the contingent consideration provision in the sale agreement for Allstate Life Insurance Company (“ALIC”) which meets the definition of a derivative. This derivative is valued internally using a model that includes stochastically determined cash flows and inputs that include spot and forward interest rates, volatility, corporate credit spreads and a liquidity discount. This derivative is categorized as Level 3 due to the significance of non-market observable inputs. \n•\nAssets held for sale:\n Comprise corporate fixed income securities. The significant inputs and valuation techniques are based on the respective asset type as described above.\nAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nComprise long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, including real estate, that are written down to fair value less costs to sell and bank loans written down to fair value in connection with recognizing credit losses.\nInvestments excluded from the fair value hierarchy\nInvestments reported at net asset value (“NAV”)\nLimited partnerships carried at fair value, which do not have readily determinable fair values, use NAV provided by the investees and are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. These investments are generally not redeemable by the investees and generally cannot be sold without approval of the general partner.

Risk reduction activity is focused on managing the risks with certain assets and liabilities arising from the potential adverse impacts from changes in risk-free interest rates, changes in equity market valuations, increases in credit spreads and foreign currency fluctuations.\nAsset replication refers to the “synthetic” creation of assets through the use of derivatives. The Company replicates fixed income securities using a combination of a credit default swap, index total return swap, options, futures, or a foreign currency forward contract and one or more highly rated fixed income securities, primarily investment grade host bonds, to synthetically replicate the economic characteristics of one or more cash market securities. The Company replicates equity securities using futures, index total return swaps, and options to increase equity exposure.\nProperty-Liability may use interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures and options to manage the interest rate risks of existing investments. These instruments are utilized to change the duration of the portfolio in order to offset the economic effect that interest rates would otherwise have on the fair value of its fixed income securities. Fixed income index total return swaps are used to offset valuation losses in the fixed income portfolio during periods of declining market values. Credit default swaps are typically used to mitigate the credit risk within the Property-Liability fixed income portfolio. Equity index total return swaps, futures and options are used by Property-Liability to offset valuation losses in the equity portfolio during periods of declining equity market values. In addition, equity futures are used to hedge the market risk related to deferred compensation liability contracts. Equity derivatives may also be utilized to replicate cash market positions to increase equity exposure. Forward contracts are primarily used by Property-Liability to hedge foreign currency risk associated with holding foreign currency denominated investments and foreign operations.\nWhen derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value or foreign currency cash flow hedges.\nThe notional amounts specified in the contracts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual payments under the agreements and are generally not representative of the potential for gain or loss on these agreements. However, the notional amounts specified \nin credit default swaps where the Company has sold credit protection represent the maximum amount of potential loss, assuming \nno\n recoveries.\nFair value, which is equal to the carrying value, is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the derivative contracts at the reporting date. The carrying value amounts for OTC derivatives are further adjusted for the effects, if any, of enforceable master netting agreements (“MNAs) and are presented on a net basis, by counterparty agreement, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nFor those derivatives which qualify and have been designated as fair value accounting hedges, net income includes the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged risk. For cash flow hedges, gains and losses are amortized from AOCI and are reported in net income in the same period the forecasted transactions being hedged impact net income. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company does not have any fair value or cash flow hedges.\nNon-hedge accounting is generally used for “portfolio” level hedging strategies where the terms of the individual hedged items do not meet the strict homogeneity requirements to permit the application of hedge accounting. For non-hedge derivatives, net income includes changes in fair value and accrued periodic settlements, when applicable. With the exception of non-hedge derivatives used for asset replication and non-hedge embedded derivatives, all of the Company’s derivatives are evaluated for their ongoing effectiveness as either accounting hedge or non-hedge derivative financial instruments on at least a quarterly basis.\nIn connection with the sale of ALIC and certain affiliates in 2021, the sale agreement included a provision related to contingent consideration that may be earned over a \nten-year\n period with the first potential payment date commencing on January 1, 2026 and a final potential payment date of January 1, 2035. The contingent consideration is determined annually based on the average ten-year U.S. Treasury rate over the preceding three-year period compared to a designated rate. The contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative and is accounted for on a fair value basis with periodic changes in fair value reflected in earnings.

Other derivatives, including futures and certain option contracts, are traded on organized exchanges which require margin deposits and guarantee the execution of trades, thereby mitigating any potential credit risk.\nCounterparty credit exposure represents the Company’s potential loss if all of the counterparties concurrently fail to perform under the contractual terms of the contracts and all collateral, if any, becomes worthless. This exposure is measured by the fair value of OTC derivative contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date reduced by the effect, if any, of legally enforceable MNAs. \nThe Allstate Corporation      133\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOTC derivatives counterparty credit exposure by counterparty credit rating\n($ in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nRating \n(1)\nNumber of counter-parties\nNotional amount \n(2)\nCredit exposure \n(2)\nExposure, net of collateral\n \n(2)\nNumber of counter-parties\nNotional amount \n(2)\nCredit exposure \n(2)\nExposure, net of collateral \n(2)\nAA-\n1\n \n$\n213\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n1\n \n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nA+\n3\n \n389\n \n10\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n4\n \n$\n602\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n2\n \n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n(1)\nAllstate uses the lower of S&P’s or Moody’s long-term debt issuer ratings.\n(2)\nOnly OTC derivatives with a net positive fair value are included for each counterparty.\nFor certain exchange traded and cleared derivatives, margin deposits are required as well as daily cash settlements of margin accounts.\nExchange traded and cleared margin deposits\n($ in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nPledged by the Company\n$\n79\n \nReceived by the Company\n—\n \nMarket risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk exists for all of the derivative financial instruments the Company currently holds, as these instruments may become less valuable due to adverse changes in market conditions. To limit this risk, the Company’s senior management has established risk control limits. \nCertain of the Company’s derivative transactions contain credit-risk-contingent termination events and cross-default provisions. Credit-risk-contingent termination events allow the counterparties to terminate the derivative agreement or a specific trade on certain dates if AIC’s financial strength credit ratings by Moody’s or S&P fall below a certain level. Credit-risk-contingent cross-default provisions allow the counterparties to terminate the derivative agreement if the Company defaults by pre-determined threshold amounts on certain debt instruments.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments with termination, cross-default or collateral credit-risk-contingent features that are in a liability position, as well as the fair value of assets and collateral that are netted against the liability in accordance with provisions within legally enforceable MNAs.\n($ in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross liability fair value of contracts containing credit-risk-contingent features\n$\n1\n \n$\n10\n \nGross asset fair value of contracts containing credit-risk-contingent features and subject to MNAs\n(\n1\n)\n(\n3\n)\nCollateral posted under MNAs for contracts containing credit-risk-contingent features\n—\n \n(\n5\n)\nMaximum amount of additional exposure for contracts with credit-risk-contingent features if all features were triggered concurrently\n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \nOff-balance sheet financial instruments\nCommitments to invest, commitments to purchase private placement securities, commitments to fund loans, financial guarantees and credit guarantees have off-balance sheet risk because their contractual amounts are not recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nContractual amounts of off-balance sheet financial instruments\nAs of December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nCommitments to invest in limited partnership interests\n$\n3,345\n \n$\n2,941\n \nPrivate placement commitments\n29\n \n62\n \nOther loan commitments\n16\n \n18\n \nIn the preceding table, the contractual amounts represent the amount at risk if the contract is fully drawn upon, the counterparty defaults and the value of any underlying security becomes worthless. Unless noted otherwise, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support off-balance sheet financial instruments with credit risk.\nCommitments to invest in limited partnership interests represent agreements to acquire new or additional participation in certain limited partnership \ninvestments. The Company enters into these agreements in the normal course of business. Because the investments in limited partnerships are not actively traded, it is not practical to estimate the fair value of these commitments.\nPrivate placement commitments represent commitments to purchase private placement debt and private equity securities at a future date. The Company enters into these agreements in the normal course of business. The fair value of the debt commitments \n134      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \ngenerally cannot be estimated on the date the commitment is made as the terms and conditions of the underlying private placement securities are not yet final. Because the private equity securities are not actively traded, it is not practical to estimate fair value of the commitments.\nOther loan commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower provided there is no violation of any \ncondition established in the contract. The Company enters into these agreements to commit to future loan fundings at predetermined interest rates. Unless unconditionally cancellable, the Company recognizes a credit loss allowance on such commitments. Commitments have either fixed or varying expiration dates or other termination clauses. The fair value of these commitments is insignificant.\nNote 9\nVariable Interest Entities\nConsolidated VIEs \nprimarily include Adirondack, a New York reciprocal insurer, and Skylands, a New Jersey reciprocal insurer (together the “Reciprocal Exchanges”). The Reciprocal Exchanges are insurance carriers organized as unincorporated associations. The Company does not own the equity of the Reciprocal Exchanges, which is owned by their respective policyholders.\nThe results of the Reciprocal Exchanges are included in the Allstate Protection segment as the Company manages the business operations of the Reciprocal Exchanges and has the power to direct their activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company holds interests of $\n123\n million in the form of surplus notes that provide capital to the Reciprocal Exchanges and absorb expected losses. \nDue to ongoing operating losses, the Company recorded a loss for the carrying value of the surplus notes in the amount of $\n123\n million in the first quarter of 2024. The loss has been reflected as a capital transaction attributable to noncontrolling interest as the Company expects \n100\n% of its interests in surplus notes to absorb expected losses of the Reciprocal Exchanges. \nAdirondack has withdrawn and stopped writing new business and Skylands will withdraw from writing substantially all business in 2025. As the reciprocal insurers are dissolved, policyholders will share any residual unassigned surplus but are not subject to assessment for any deficit in unassigned surplus of the Reciprocal Exchanges. The assets of the Reciprocal Exchanges can be used only to settle the obligations of the Reciprocal Exchanges and general creditors have no recourse to the Company.\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services approved the withdrawal plan for Adirondack to non-renew or cancel all policies effective as of December 31, 2024. National General Holdings Corp. and Adirondack entered into a $\n15\n million line of credit agreement to pay claims if Adirondack is unable to pay, which will expire after a final reserve study is conducted to determine if additional funding is needed as of December 31, 2027. As of December 31, 2024, there is \nno\n outstanding balance on the line of credit. Additionally, the Company waived all fees payable by Adirondack after July 1, 2024, excluding loss adjustment expenses associated with individual claims.\nThe New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance acknowledged the withdrawal plan filed on behalf of Skylands to withdraw from providing personal lines insurance, except dwelling fire and watercraft policies, beginning December 14, 2024. Skylands has a \n100\n% quota share reinsurance agreement to cede all of Skylands’ business to the Company. Claims and claims expense ceded to the Company were $\n40\n million, $\n40\n million and $\n6\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company received a management fee for the services provided to the Reciprocal Exchanges totaling $\n24\n million, $\n48\n million and $\n46\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Reciprocal Exchanges generated $\n199\n million, $\n224\n million and $\n164\n million of earned premiums in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total costs and expenses were $\n280\n million, $\n251\n million and $\n244\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Allstate Corporation      135\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAssets and liabilities of Reciprocal Exchanges\n($ in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets\nFixed income securities\n$\n47\n \n$\n267\n \nShort-term investments\n112\n \n7\n \nDeferred policy acquisition costs\n—\n \n20\n \nPremium installment and other receivables, net\n9\n \n40\n \nReinsurance recoverables, net\n76\n \n111\n \nOther assets\n25\n \n54\n \nTotal assets\n269\n \n499\n \nLiabilities\nReserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense\n214\n \n201\n \nUnearned premiums\n22\n \n147\n \nOther liabilities and expenses\n235\n \n296\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n471\n \n$\n644\n \nNonconsolidated VIEs\n  The Company makes investments in limited partnership interests and other alternative investments that may be issued by VIEs. These investments are generally accounted for under the equity method and are reported as limited partnership interests in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company does not take an active role in the management of these investments. Therefore, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary as it has no ability to direct activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the investments. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the investment carrying value and any unfunded commitments. Neither the Company’s carrying amounts nor the unfunded commitments related to these VIEs are material individually or in the aggregate.\nIn addition, the Company makes investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the investment manager. These \nstructured investments typically invest in fixed income securities and are managed by third parties and include ABS and collateralized debt obligations. The Company has not provided financial or other support other than its original investment. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of the Company’s investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs, the Company’s inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs, and, where applicable, the level of credit subordination which reduces the Company’s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of the Company’s investment. Neither the Company’s carrying amounts nor the unfunded commitments related to these VIEs are material individually or in the aggregate.\nNote 10\nReserve for Property and Casualty Insurance Claims and Claims Expense\nThe Company establishes reserves for claims and claims expense on reported and unreported claims of insured losses. The Company’s reserving process considers known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including the Company’s experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, changes in laws and regulations, judicial decisions and economic conditions.\nWhen the Company experiences changes in the mix or type of claims or changing claim settlement patterns or data, it applies actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors to develop reserve liabilities. Inflation and a higher mix of more complex repairs, combined with skilled labor shortages, have increased physical damage loss costs. Medical inflation, increased treatment trends, higher attorney representation, rising litigation costs and more severe accidents have contributed to higher third-party bodily injury loss costs. The Company continues to digitize and modernize claim processes to \nincrease effectiveness and efficiency. These factors may lead to historical development trends being less predictive of future loss development, potentially creating additional reserve variability. Generally, the initial reserves for a new accident year are established based on claim frequency and severity assumptions for different business segments, lines and coverages based on historical relationships to relevant inflation indicators. Reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using several different actuarial estimation methods. Changes in auto claim frequency may result from changes in mix of business, driving behaviors, miles driven or other factors. Changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors, changes in attorney represented and litigated claim behavior, the effectiveness and efficiency of claim settlements and changes in mix of claim types. When changes in claim data occur, actuarial judgment is used to determine appropriate development factors to establish reserves. The Company’s reserving process incorporates changes in loss patterns, operational statistics and changes in \n136      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nclaims reporting processes to determine its best estimate of recorded reserves.\nAs part of the reserving process, the Company may also supplement its claims processes by utilizing third-party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors and other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process.\nBecause reserves are estimates of unpaid portions of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, Run-off Property-Liability and reinsurance and indemnification recoverables, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on management’s best estimates.\nThe highest degree of uncertainty is associated with reserves for losses incurred in the initial reporting period as it contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled as well as heightened uncertainty for claims that involve litigation \nor take longer to settle during periods of rapidly increasing loss costs. The Company also has uncertainty in the Run-off Property-Liability reserves that are based on events long since passed and are complicated by lack of historical data, legal interpretations, unresolved legal issues and legislative intent based on establishment of facts.\nThe Company regularly updates its reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in reserve estimates, which may be material, are reported in property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determined.\nManagement believes that the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense, net of recoverables, is appropriately established in the aggregate and adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of reported and unreported claims arising from losses which had occurred by the date of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on available facts, laws and regulations.\nRollforward of reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance as of January 1\n$\n39,858\n \n$\n37,541\n \n$\n33,060\n \nLess recoverables \n(1)\n8,396\n \n9,176\n \n9,479\n \nNet balance as of January 1\n31,462\n \n28,365\n \n23,581\n \nIncurred claims and claims expense related to:\nCurrent year\n40,043\n \n40,521\n \n35,523\n \nPrior years\n(\n308\n)\n549\n \n1,741\n \nTotal incurred\n39,735\n \n41,070\n \n37,264\n \nClaims and claims expense paid related to:\nCurrent year\n(\n23,488\n)\n(\n23,607\n)\n(\n20,739\n)\nPrior years\n(\n14,394\n)\n(\n14,366\n)\n(\n11,741\n)\nTotal paid\n(\n37,882\n)\n(\n37,973\n)\n(\n32,480\n)\nNet balance as of December 31\n33,315\n \n31,462\n \n28,365\n \nPlus recoverables\n8,602\n \n8,396\n \n9,176\n \nBalance as of December 31\n$\n41,917\n \n$\n39,858\n \n$\n37,541\n \n(1)\nRecoverables comprises reinsurance and indemnification recoverables.

This expense includes losses from catastrophes of $\n4.96\n billion, $\n5.64\n billion and $\n3.11\n billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, net of recoverables. Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance business that have contributed to, and will continue to contribute to, material year-to-year fluctuations in the Company’s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company defines a “catastrophe” as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $\n1\n million and involves multiple first-party policyholders, or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms and freezes, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. \nThe Company is also exposed to man-made catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism, civil unrest, wildfires or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.\nThe Company calculates and records a single best reserve estimate for losses from catastrophes, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards. As a result, management believes that no other estimate is better than the recorded amount. Due to the uncertainties involved, including the factors described above, the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on management’s best estimates.\nPrior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense \n(1)\nFor the years ended December 31,\nNon-catastrophe losses\nCatastrophe losses\nTotal\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAuto\n$\n(\n328\n)\n$\n294\n \n$\n1,249\n \n$\n(\n36\n)\n$\n(\n50\n)\n$\n(\n64\n)\n$\n(\n364\n)\n$\n244\n \n$\n1,185\n \nHomeowners\n(\n73\n)\n66\n \n123\n \n(\n322\n)\n36\n \n77\n \n(\n395\n)\n102\n \n200\n \nOther personal lines\n224\n \n37\n \n(\n34\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n18\n)\n2\n \n217\n \n19\n \n(\n32\n)\nCommercial lines\n171\n \n76\n \n273\n \n(\n5\n)\n8\n \n(\n1\n)\n166\n \n84\n \n272\n \nOther business lines\n—\n \n12\n \n(\n10\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n12\n \n(\n6\n)\nRun-off Property-Liability \n(2)\n68\n \n89\n \n125\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n68\n \n89\n \n125\n \nProtection Services\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n3\n)\nTotal prior year reserve reestimates\n$\n62\n \n$\n573\n \n$\n1,723\n \n$\n(\n370\n)\n$\n(\n24\n)\n$\n18\n \n$\n(\n308\n)\n$\n549\n \n$\n1,741\n \n(1)\nFavorable reserve reestimates are shown in parentheses.\n(2)\nThe Company’s 2024, 2023 and 2022\n \nannual reserve review, using established industry and actuarial best practices, resulted in unfavorable reestimates of $\n58\n million, $\n80\n million and $\n118\n million, respectively.\n \n138      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nThe following presents information about incurred and paid claims development as of December 31, 2024, net of recoverables, as well as the cumulative number of reported claims and the total of IBNR reserves plus expected development on reported claims included in the net incurred claims amounts.

10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nProperty and casualty reinsurance and indemnifications recoverables \nProperty and casualty programs are grouped by the following characteristics:\n1.\nIndemnification programs - industry pools, facilities or associations that are governed by state insurance statutes or regulations or the federal government.\n2.\nCatastrophe reinsurance programs - reinsurance protection for catastrophe exposure nationwide and by specific states, as applicable.\n3.\nOther reinsurance programs - reinsurance protection for asbestos, environmental and other liability exposures as well as commercial lines, including the shared economy program currently in run-off.\nProperty and casualty reinsurance is in place for the Allstate Protection, Run-off Property-Liability and Protection Services segments. The Company purchases reinsurance after evaluating the financial condition of the reinsurer as well as the terms and price of coverage.\nIndemnification programs  \nThe Company participates in state-based industry pools or facilities mandating participation by insurers offering certain coverage in their state, including the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (“MCCA”), the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association (“PLIGA”), the North Carolina Reinsurance Facility (“NCRF”) and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”). When the Company pays qualifying claims under the coverage indemnified by a state’s pool or facility, the Company is reimbursed for the qualifying claim losses and expenses. Each state pool or facility may assess participating companies to collect sufficient amounts to meet its total indemnification requirements. The enabling legislation for each state’s pool or facility compels the pool or facility only to indemnify participating companies for qualifying claim losses and expenses; the state pool or facility does not underwrite the coverage or take on the ultimate risk of the indemnified business. As a pass through, these pools or facilities manage the receipt of assessments paid by participating companies and payment of indemnified amounts for covered claims presented by participating companies. The Company has not had any credit losses related to these indemnification programs.\nState-based industry pools or facilities\n \nMichigan Catastrophic Claims Association  \nThe MCCA is a statutory indemnification mechanism for member insurers’ qualifying Personal Injury Protection (“PIP”) claims paid for the unlimited lifetime medical benefits above the applicable retention level for qualifying injuries from automobile, motorcycle and commercial vehicle accidents. Indemnification recoverables on paid and unpaid claims, including IBNR, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 include $\n6.48\n billion and $\n6.42\n billion, respectively, from the MCCA for its indemnification obligation.\nThe MCCA is funded by annually assessing participating member companies actively writing motor vehicle coverage in Michigan on a per vehicle basis. The MCCA’s calculation of the annual assessment is based upon the total of members’ actuarially determined present value of expected payments on lifetime claims by all persons expected to be catastrophically injured in that year and ultimately qualify for MCCA reimbursement, its operating expenses, and adjustments for the amount of excesses or deficiencies in prior assessments.\n \nThe assessment is incurred by the Company as policies are written and recovered as a component of premiums from the Company’s customers.\nThe MCCA indemnifies qualifying claims of all current and former member companies (whether or not actively writing motor vehicle coverage in Michigan) for qualifying claims and claims expenses incurred while the member companies were actively writing the mandatory PIP coverage in Michigan. Member companies actively writing automobile coverage in Michigan include the MCCA annual assessments in determining the level of premiums to charge insureds in the state.\nAs required for member companies by the MCCA, the Company reports covered paid and unpaid claims to the MCCA when estimates of loss for a reported claim are expected to exceed the retention level, the claims involve certain types of severe injuries, or there are litigation demands received suggesting the claim value exceeds certain thresholds. The retention level is adjusted upward every other MCCA fiscal year by the lesser of \n6\n% or the increase in the consumer price index. The retention level is $\n635\n thousand per claim for the fiscal \ntwo-years\n ending June 30, 2025 compared to $\n600\n thousand per claim for the fiscal \ntwo-years\n ending June 30, 2023.\nThe MCCA is obligated to fund the ultimate liability of member companies’ qualifying claims and claim expenses. The MCCA does not underwrite the insurance coverage or hold any underwriting risk. \nThe MCCA indemnifies members as qualifying claims are paid and billed by members to the MCCA. Unlimited lifetime covered losses result in significant levels of ultimate incurred claim reserves being recorded by member companies along with offsetting indemnification recoverables. Disputes with claimants over coverage on certain reported claims can result in additional losses, which may be recoverable from the MCCA, excluding litigation expenses.\nThe MCCA annual assessments fund current operations, member company reimbursements and any deficit. The MCCA prepares statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (“MI DOI”). The MI DOI has granted the MCCA a statutory permitted practice that expires on June 30, 2025 to discount its liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expense. As of June 30, 2024, the date of its most recent annual financial report, the MCCA had cash and invested assets of $\n22.37\n billion and an \nThe Allstate Corporation      149\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\naccumulated deficit of $\n2.10\n billion. The permitted practice reduced the accumulated deficit by $\n47.30\n billion.  \nNew Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association \n PLIGA serves as the statutory administrator of the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund (“UCJF”), Workers’ Compensation Security Fund and the New Jersey Surplus Lines Insurance Guaranty Fund.\nIn addition to its insolvency protection responsibilities, PLIGA reimburses insurers for unlimited excess medical benefits (“EMBs”) paid in connection with PIP claims in excess of $\n75,000\n for policies issued or renewed prior to January 1, 1991, and limited EMB claims in excess of $\n75,000\n and capped at $\n250,000\n for policies issued or renewed on or after January 1, 1991, to December 31, 2003.\nAssessments paid to PLIGA for the EMB program totaled $\n8\n million in 2024. The amounts of paid and unpaid recoverables as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $\n370\n million and $\n326\n million, respectively.\nPLIGA annually assesses all admitted property and casualty insurers writing covered lines in New Jersey for PLIGA indemnification and expenses. PLIGA assessments may be recouped as a surcharge on premiums collected. PLIGA does not ultimately retain underwriting risk as it assesses member companies for their expected qualifying losses to provide funding for payment of its indemnification obligation to member companies for their actual losses. As a pass through, PLIGA facilitates these transactions of receipt of assessments paid by member companies and payment to member companies for covered claims presented by them for indemnification. As of December 31, 2023, the date of its most recent annual financial report, PLIGA had a fund balance of $\n301\n million.\nAs statutory administrator of the UCJF, PLIGA provides compensation to qualified claimants for PIP, bodily injury, or death caused by private passenger automobiles operated by uninsured or “hit and run” drivers. The UCJF also provides private passenger pedestrian PIP benefits when no other coverage is available.\nPLIGA annually collects a UCJF assessment from all admitted property and casualty insurers writing motor vehicle liability insurance in New Jersey for UCJF indemnification and expenses. UCJF assessments can be expensed as losses recoverable in rates as appropriate. As of December 31, 2023, the date of its most recent annual financial report, the UCJF fund had a balance of $\n69\n million.\nNorth Carolina Reinsurance Facility\n  The NCRF provides automobile liability insurance to drivers that private market insurers are not otherwise willing to insure. All insurers licensed to write automobile insurance in North Carolina are members of the NCRF. Premiums, losses and expenses are assigned to the NCRF. North Carolina law allows the NCRF to recoup operating losses for certain insureds through a surcharge to policyholders. As of September 30, 2024, the NCRF reported $\n52\n million in members’ equity. The \nNCRF implemented a recoupment surcharge on all private passenger and commercial fleet policies effective October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025. The NCRF results are shared by the member companies in proportion to their respective North Carolina automobile liability writings. As of December 31, 2024, our NCRF recoverables on paid claims was $\n97\n million and recoverables on unpaid claims was $\n359\n million. Paid recoverable balances, if covered, are typically settled within sixty days of monthly filing.\nFlorida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund\n  Allstate subsidiaries Castle Key Insurance Company (“CKIC”) and Castle Key Indemnity Company (together with CKIC, “Castle Key”), Integon National Insurance Company and Century-National Insurance Company participate in the mandatory coverage provided by the FHCF and therefore have access to reimbursement for certain qualifying Florida hurricane losses from the FHCF. The companies have exposure to assessments and pay annual premiums to the FHCF for this reimbursement protection. The FHCF has the authority to issue bonds to pay its obligations to participating insurers in excess of its capital balances. Payment of these bonds is funded by emergency assessments on all property and casualty premiums in the state, except workers’ compensation, medical malpractice, accident and health insurance and policies written under the National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”). The FHCF emergency assessments are limited to \n6\n% of premiums per year beginning the first year in which reimbursements require the issuance of a revenue bond, and up to a total of \n10\n% of premiums per year for assessments in the second and subsequent years, if required to fund additional bonds. The FHCF has not issued an emergency assessment since 2015.\nAnnual premiums earned and paid to the FHCF were $\n23\n million, $\n28\n million and $\n24\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Qualifying losses were $(\n1\n) million in 2024 including final settlements related to Hurricane Michael recoveries, $(\n6\n) million in 2023 including final settlements related to Hurricane Irma recoveries and $\n74\n million\n in 2022. The Company has access to reimbursement provided by the FHCF for \n90\n% of qualifying personal property losses that exceed its current retention of $\n98\n million for the \ntwo\n largest hurricanes and $\n33\n million for other hurricanes, up to a maximum total of $\n205\n million\n, effective from June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025\n. T\nhe amounts recoverable from the FHCF totaled $\n73\n million and $\n82\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nFederal Government - National Flood Insurance Program  \nNFIP is a program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) whereby the Company sells and services NFIP flood insurance policies as an agent of FEMA and receives fees for its services. The Company is fully indemnified for claims and claim expenses and does not retain any ultimate risk for the indemnified business. The federal government is obligated to pay all claims and certain allocated loss adjustment expenses in accordance with the arrangement.\n150      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nCongressional authorization for the NFIP is periodically evaluated and may be subjected to freezes, including when the federal government experiences a shutdown. FEMA has a NFIP reinsurance program to manage the future exposure of the NFIP through the transfer of risk to private reinsurance companies and capital market investors. Congress must periodically renew the funding of the program as well as consider reforms to the program that would be incorporated in legislation to reauthorize the NFIP. On December 21, 2024, the president signed legislation passed by Congress that extends the NFIP authorization until March 14, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the NFIP owes $\n20.5\n billion to the U.S. Treasury.\nThe amounts recoverable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $\n279\n million and $\n76\n million, respectively. Annual premiums earned and paid to NFIP include $\n368\n million, $\n327\n million and $\n319\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Qualifying losses incurred that are ceded to NFIP include $\n618\n million, $\n102\n million and $\n435\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCatastrophe reinsurance  \nThe Company’s reinsurance program is designed to provide reinsurance protection for catastrophes resulting from multiple perils including hurricanes, windstorms, hail, tornadoes, winter storms, wildfires, earthquakes and fires following earthquakes.\n•\nThe Company purchases reinsurance from traditional reinsurance companies as well as the insurance-linked securities (“ILS”) market.\n•\nThe majority of the Company’s program comprises multi-year contracts, primarily placed in the traditional reinsurance market, such that generally one-third of the program is renewed every year. \n•\nCoverage is generally purchased on a broad geographic, product line and multiple peril loss basis.\n•\nFlorida personal lines property is covered by a separate agreement, as the risk of loss is different and the Company’s subsidiaries operating in this state are separately capitalized. \n•\nWhen applicable, reinsurance reinstatement premiums are recognized in the same period as the loss event that gave rise to the reinstatement premium and are recorded in claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company’s current catastrophe reinsurance program utilizes the Company’s risk and return framework which is intended to provide shareholders with an acceptable return on the risks assumed in the property business, and to reduce variability of earnings, while providing protection to customers. This framework incorporates the Company’s robust economic capital model and is informed by catastrophe risk models including hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires. The Company monitors risk both in the aggregate and by peril, while also evaluating model performance relative to experience \nand its expectations of catastrophe risk trends. As of December 31, 2024, the modeled 1-in-100 probable maximum loss for hurricane, earthquake and wildfire perils is approximately $\n3.5\n billion, net of reinsurance. The Company continually reviews its aggregate risk appetite and the cost and availability of reinsurance to optimize the risk and return profile of this exposure. The following catastrophe reinsurance agreements are in effect as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Nationwide Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance Program (the “Nationwide Program”)\n provides coverage up to $\n7.90\n billion of loss less retentions of $\n750\n million to $\n1.00\n billion for the first event of the program year and is subject to the percentage of reinsurance placed in each of its agreements. Multiple wildfires can be defined by the Nationwide Program as a single event occurrence based on a combination of when the events occur and their proximity to one another. Property business in the state of Florida is excluded from this program. Separate reinsurance agreements address the distinct needs of separately capitalized legal entities. The Nationwide Program includes reinsurance agreements with both the traditional and ILS markets as described below: \n•\nCore traditional market per occurrence agreements \nprovide limits totaling $\n5.09\n billion for catastrophe losses arising out of multiple perils and are comprised of the following:\n–\nMulti-year contracts providing combined $\n3.25\n billion of placed limits exhausting at $\n4.25\n billion, with a \n5\n% co-participation and \none\n annual reinstatement. One third of the contracts are structured with a $\n750\n million retention for the first event and $\n500\n million retention for subsequent events with remaining contracts attaching at a $\n1.00\n billion retention. \n–\nTwo\n \neight-year\n term contracts providing combined $\n236\n million of placed limits, both with a \n5\n% co-participation and \none\n reinstatement of limits over each contract’s term.\n–\nSix\n single-year contracts providing combined $\n1.61\n billion of placed limits filling capacity around the multi-year and ILS placements, with \ntwo\n contracts providing \none\n reinstatement of limits. \n•\nILS placements\n provide $\n1.95\n billion of placed limits, with no reinstatement of limits, and are comprised of the following: \n–\nSix\n contracts providing occurrence coverage of $\n1.30\n billion of placed limits, reinsuring losses in all states except Florida caused by named storms, earthquakes and fire following earthquakes, severe weather, wildfires, and other naturally occurring or man-made events determined to be a catastrophe by the Company.\n–\nTwo\n contracts providing occurrence and aggregate coverage of $\n325\n million of placed \nThe Allstate Corporation      151\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nlimits, also provide that for each annual period beginning April 1, Allstate declared catastrophes to personal lines property and automobile business can be aggregated to erode the aggregate retention and qualify for coverage under the aggregate limits. Recoveries are limited to the ultimate net loss from the reinsured event.\n–\nTwo\n contracts, providing aggregate coverage of $\n325\n million of placed limits.\nFlorida program\n Our 2024 program provides coverage for property policies of CKIC and certain affiliate companies for Florida catastrophe events up to $\n890\n million of losses less a $\n30\n million retention. The Florida program includes reinsurance agreements placed in the traditional market, the FHCF and the ILS market as follows:\n•\n \n \nTraditional market\n placements comprise reinsurance limits for losses to personal lines property in Florida arising out of multiple perils. One contract provides $\n235\n million of reinsurance limit with reinstatement, and \none\n contract provides $\n75\n million of reinsurance limit for a second event. A portion of the traditional market placements provide coverage for perils not covered by the FHCF contracts, which only cover hurricanes. \n•\nILS placements\n provide $\n625\n million of reinsurance limits for qualifying losses to personal lines property in Florida caused by a named storm event, a severe weather event, an earthquake event, a fire event, a volcanic eruption event, or a meteorite impact event.\n•\nInuring contracts include three mandatory FHCF contracts providing $\n206\n million of limits for qualifying losses to personal lines property in Florida caused by storms the National Hurricane Center declares to be hurricanes. The \nthree\n contracts are \n90\n% placed.\nNational General Lender Services Standalone Program \nis placed in the traditional market and provides $\n265\n million of coverage, subject to a $\n70\n million retention, with \none\n reinstatement of limits. Inuring contracts include the National General FHCF contract providing $\n71\n million of limits in excess of a $\n36\n million retention, \n90\n% placed.\nNational General Reciprocal Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance Contracts\n are placed in the traditional market and provide $\n212\n million of placed limits, subject to a $\n7\n million retention, with \none\n reinstatement of limits.\nKentucky Earthquake Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract\n is placed in the traditional market and provides $\n27\n million, subject to a $\n2\n million retention with \none\n reinstatement of limits.\nCanada Catastrophe Excess of Loss Reinsurance Contract \nis placed in the traditional market and provides CAD \n355\n million of placed limits, subject to a CAD \n75\n million retention, with \none\n reinstatement of limits.\nThe Company has not experienced credit losses on its catastrophe reinsurance programs. The total cost of the property catastrophe reinsurance program was $\n1.11\n billion, $\n1.02\n billion and $\n788\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther reinsurance programs  \nThe Company’s other reinsurance programs relate to commercial lines and asbestos, environmental and other liability exposures. The largest reinsurance recoverable balance the Company had outstanding was $\n175\n million and $\n180\n million from Lloyd’s of London as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These programs also include reinsurance recoverables of $\n77\n million and $\n67\n million from Pacific Valley Insurance Company, Inc. as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n152

Interest on the $\n800\n million Subordinated Debentures was payable semi-annually at the stated fixed annual rate to August 14, 2023, or any earlier redemption date, and then quarterly at an annual rate equal to the three-month SOFR plus \n2.938\n% plus \n0.26161\n%. \nJunior Subordinated Debentures\n  As of December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding $\n500\n million of Series A \n6.500\n% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures (“Junior Subordinated Debentures”). The scheduled maturity date for the Debentures is May 15, 2057 with a final maturity date of May 15, 2067. The Junior Subordinated Debentures may be redeemed (i) in whole or in part, at any time on or after May 15, 2037 at the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or in part, prior to May 15, 2037 at the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price.\nInterest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures is payable semi-annually at the stated fixed annual rate to May 15, 2037, and then payable quarterly at an annual rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus \n2.120\n%, which was replaced with the CME Term SOFR Reference Rate published for a three-month tenor plus a spread adjustment of \n0.26161\n%. The Company may elect at one or more times to defer payment of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures for one or more consecutive interest periods that do not exceed \n10\n years. Interest compounds during such deferral periods at the rate in effect for each period. The interest deferral feature obligates the Company in certain circumstances to issue common stock or certain other types of securities if it cannot otherwise raise sufficient funds to make the required interest payments. The Company has reserved \n75\n million shares of its authorized and unissued common stock to satisfy this obligation.\nThe terms of the Subordinated Debentures and Junior Subordinated Debentures prohibit the Company from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on common or preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring, or making liquidation payments on common stock or preferred stock if the Company has elected to defer interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures or Junior Subordinated Debentures, respectively, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Junior Subordinated Debentures, the Company entered into a replacement capital covenant (“RCC”). This covenant was not intended for the benefit of the holders of the Junior Subordinated Debentures and could not be enforced by them. Rather, it was for the benefit of holders of one or more other designated series of the Company’s indebtedness (“covered debt”), currently the $\n800\n million Floating Rate Subordinated Debentures due in 2053. Pursuant to the RCC, the Company has agreed that it will not repay, redeem, or purchase the Junior Subordinated Debentures on or before May 15, 2067 (or such earlier date on which the RCC terminates by its terms) unless, subject to certain limitations, the Company has received net cash proceeds in specified amounts from the sale of common stock or certain other qualifying securities. The promises and covenants contained in the RCC will not apply if (i) S&P upgrades the Company’s issuer credit rating to A or above, (ii) the Company redeems the Junior Subordinated Debentures due to a tax event, (iii) after notice of redemption has been given by the Company and a market disruption event occurs preventing the Company from raising proceeds in accordance with the RCC, or (iv) the Company repurchases or redeems up to \n10\n% of the outstanding principal of the Junior Subordinated Debentures in any \none-year\n period, provided that no more than \n25\n% will be so repurchased, redeemed or purchased in any \nten-year\n period.\nThe RCC terminates in 2067. The RCC will terminate prior to its scheduled termination date if (i) the Junior Subordinated Debentures are no longer outstanding and the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the RCC or it is no longer applicable, (ii) the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding principal amount of the then-effective series of covered debt consent to agree to the termination of the RCC, (iii) the Company does not have any series of outstanding debt that is eligible to be treated as covered debt under the RCC, (iv) the Junior Subordinated Debentures are accelerated as a result of an event of default, (v) certain rating agency or change in control events occur, (vi) S&P, or any successor thereto, no longer assigns a solicited rating on senior debt issued or guaranteed by the Company, or (vii) the termination of the RCC would have no effect on the equity credit provided by S&P with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debentures. An event of default, as defined by the supplemental indenture, includes default in the payment of interest or principal and bankruptcy proceedings. \nOther capital resources\n  To manage short-term liquidity, the Company maintains a commercial paper program with a borrowing capacity up to $\n750\n million. In addition, the Company has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a borrowing limit of $\n750\n million. The maturity date is November 2027. This facility contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional $\n500\n million of borrowing. This facility has a financial covenant requiring the Company not to exceed a \n37.5\n% debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the agreement. Although the right to borrow under the facility is not \nThe Allstate Corporation      155\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nsubject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of the Company’s senior unsecured, unguaranteed long-term debt. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility. \nNo\n amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2024 or 2023. The Company had \nno\n commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nThe Company paid $\n395\n million, $\n355\n million and $\n323\n million of interest on debt in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nThe Company had $\n215\n million and $\n209\n million of investment-related debt\n \nthat is reported in other liabilities and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company has access to a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC that was filed on \nApril 30, 2024 and expires in 2027. The registration statement covers an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units.\nCommon stock\n  The Company had \n900\n million shares of issued common stock of which \n265\n million shares were outstanding and \n635\n million shares were held in treasury as of December 31, 2024. In 2024, the Company acquired \n278\n thousand shares at an average cost of $\n174.03\n and reissued \n2\n million net shares under equity incentive plans.\nPreferred stock\n  All outstanding preferred stock represents noncumulative perpetual preferred stock with a $\n1.00\n par value per share and a liquidation preference of $\n25,000\n per share.\nTotal preferred stock outstanding\nAs of December 31,\nAggregate liquidation preference \n($ in millions)\nDividend per depository share \n(1)\nAggregate dividend payment ($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nDividend rate\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSeries G\n (2)\n—\n \n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n5.625\n \n%\n$\n—\n \n$\n0.70\n \n$\n1.41\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n16\n \n(3)\n$\n32\n \nSeries H\n46,000\n \n46,000\n \n1,150.0\n \n1,150.0\n \n5.100\n \n1.28\n \n1.28\n \n1.28\n \n59\n \n59\n \n59\n \nSeries I\n12,000\n \n12,000\n \n300.0\n \n300.0\n \n4.750\n \n1.19\n \n1.19\n \n1.19\n \n14\n \n14\n \n14\n \nSeries J\n24,000\n \n24,000\n \n600.0\n \n600.0\n \n7.375\n \n1.84\n \n0.75\n \n—\n \n44\n \n18\n \n—\n \nTotal\n82,000\n \n82,000\n \n$\n2,050\n \n$\n2,050\n \n$\n117\n \n$\n107\n \n$\n105\n \n(1)\nEach depository share represents a 1/1,000\nth\n interest in a share of preferred stock.\n(2)\nOn April 17, 2023, the Company redeemed all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock Series G.\n(3)\nExcludes $\n18\n million related to original issuance costs in preferred stock dividends on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity as a result of the preferred stock redemptions.\nThe preferred stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and liquidation rights. The Company will pay dividends on the preferred stock on a noncumulative basis only when, as and if declared by the Company’s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) and to the extent that the Company has legally available funds to pay dividends. If dividends are declared on the preferred stock, they will be payable quarterly in arrears at an annual fixed rate. Dividends on the preferred stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, in the event dividends are not declared on the preferred stock for payment on any dividend payment date, then those dividends will cease to be payable. If the Company has not declared a dividend before the dividend payment date for any dividend period, the Company has no obligation to pay dividends for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend period. No dividends may be paid or declared on the Company’s common stock and no shares of the Company’s common stock may be repurchased unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on the preferred stock have been declared and paid or provided for.\nThe preferred stock does not have voting rights except with respect to certain changes in the terms of the preferred stock, in the case of certain dividend nonpayment, certain other fundamental corporate events, mergers or consolidations and as otherwise provided by law. If and when dividends have not been declared and paid in full for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the authorized number of directors then constituting the Company’s board of directors will be increased by \ntwo\n. The holders of the preferred stock, together with the holders of all other affected classes and series of voting parity stock, voting as a single class, will be entitled to elect the \ntwo\n additional members of the board of directors of the Company, subject to certain conditions. The board of directors shall at no time have more than \ntwo\n preferred stock directors.\nThe preferred stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. The preferred stock is redeemable at the Company’s option in whole or in part, on or after October 15, 2024 for Series H, January 15, 2025 for Series I and July 15, 2028 for Series J at a redemption price of $\n25,000\n per share, plus declared and unpaid \n156      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \ndividends.

These programs generally involve a reduction in staffing levels, and in certain cases, office closures. Restructuring and related charges primarily include the following costs related to these programs:\n•\nEmployee\n - severance and relocation benefits\n•\nExit\n - contract termination penalties and real estate costs primarily related to accelerated amortization of right-of-use assets and related leasehold improvements at facilities to be vacated\nThe expenses related to these activities are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as restructuring and related charges and totaled $\n61\n million, $\n169\n million and $\n51\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses in 2024 primarily relate to implementing actions to achieve a new phase of the organizational transformation component of the \nTransformative Growth plan, which commenced in the second quarter of 2024. Organizational transformation includes streamlining the organization and outsourcing certain aspects of operations. The Company continues to identify ways to improve operating efficiency and reduce cost which may result in additional restructuring charges in the future.\nOrganizational transformation\n($ in millions)\nExpected program charges \n$\n24\n \nChanges in estimated program initiatives and costs\n25\n \n2024 expenses\n(\n45\n)\nRemaining program charges\n$\n4\n \nThese charges are primarily recorded in the Allstate Protection segment.

The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of generally \n1\n year to \n10\n years which could include options to extend or terminate that varies across agreements. \nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term less than one year are not recorded on the balance sheet and the lease costs for these leases are recorded as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating leases with terms greater than one year result in a lease liability recorded in \nother liabilities\n and accrued expenses with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset recorded in \nother assets\n on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $\n235\n million and $\n265\n million in lease liabilities and $\n165\n million and $\n163\n million in ROU assets, respectively.\nOperating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets are recognized based on the corresponding lease liabilities adjusted for qualifying initial direct costs, prepaid or accrued lease payments and unamortized lease incentives. As most of the Company’s leases do not disclose the implicit interest rate, the Company uses collateralized incremental borrowing rates based on information available at lease commencement when determining the present value of future lease payments. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease which are incorporated into the Company’s measurements when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. \nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and include interest expense on the lease liability and amortization of the ROU asset. Variable lease costs are expensed as \nThe Allstate Corporation      157\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincurred and include maintenance costs and real estate taxes. Lease costs are reported in operating costs and expenses and totaled $\n92\n million, $\n102\n million and $\n131\n million, including $\n14\n million, $\n19\n million and $\n23\n million of variable lease costs in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther information related to operating leases\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years)\n4\n3\nWeighted average discount rate\n4.17\n \n%\n3.48\n \n%\nMaturity of lease liabilities\n($ in millions)\nOperating leases\n2025\n$\n83\n \n2026\n70\n \n2027\n41\n \n2028\n24\n \n2029\n18\n \nThereafter\n18\n \nTotal lease payments \n$\n254\n \nLess: interest\n(\n19\n)\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n$\n235\n \nShared markets and state facility assessments\nThe Company is required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations in various states that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. \nThe Company routinely reviews its exposure to assessments from these plans, facilities and government programs. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to the Company’s results of operations in the last three years. Because of the Company’s participation, it may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities or assessments from these facilities.\nFlorida Citizens \n Castle Key is subject to assessments from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in the state of Florida (“FL Citizens”), which was initially created by the state of Florida to provide insurance to eligible property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market. FL Citizens, at the discretion and direction of its Board of Governors, can levy a regular assessment on assessable insurers and assessable insureds for a deficit in any calendar year up to a maximum of the greater of: \n2\n% of the projected deficit or \n2\n% of the aggregate statewide direct written premium for the prior calendar year. The base of assessable insurers includes all property and casualty premiums in the state. If a deficit remains after levying the regular assessment, FL Citizens can also levy an emergency assessment of up to \n10\n% of the deficit or \n10\n% of the aggregate statewide direct written premium for the prior calendar year. Companies are required to collect \nthe emergency assessments directly from residential property policyholders and remit to FL Citizens as collected. Currently, the emergency assessment is \nzero\n for all policies issued or renewed on or after July 1, 2015.\nLouisiana Citizens \n Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (“LA Citizens”) can levy a regular assessment on participating companies for a deficit in any calendar year up to a maximum of the greater of \n10\n% of the calendar year deficit or \n10\n% of Louisiana direct property premiums industry-wide for the prior calendar year.\n \nIf the plan year deficit exceeds the amount that can be recovered through regular assessments, LA Citizens may fund the remaining deficit by issuing revenue assessment bonds in the capital markets. LA Citizens then declares emergency assessments each year to provide debt service on the bonds until they are retired. Companies writing assessable lines must surcharge their policyholders emergency assessments in the percentage established annually by LA Citizens and must remit amounts collected to the bond trustee on a quarterly basis. Emergency assessments to pay off bonds issued in 2007 for the hurricanes of 2005 will continue until 2025.\nFacilities such as FL Citizens and LA Citizens are generally designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders; however, the exposure to assessments from these facilities and the availability of recoupments or premium rate increases may not offset each other in the Company’s financial statements. Moreover, even if they do offset each other, they may not offset each other in financial statements for the same fiscal period due to the ultimate timing of the assessments and recoupments or premium rate increases, as well as the possibility of policies not being renewed in subsequent years.\nCalifornia Earthquake Authority \n Exposure to certain potential losses from earthquakes in California is limited by the Company’s participation in the California Earthquake Authority (“CEA”), which provides insurance for California earthquake losses. The CEA is a privately financed, publicly managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage. Insurers selling homeowners insurance in California are required to offer earthquake insurance to their customers either through their company or by participation in the CEA. The Company’s homeowners policies continue to include coverages for losses caused by explosions, theft, glass breakage and fires following an earthquake, which are not underwritten by the CEA.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the CEA’s capital balance was approximately $\n6.0\n billion. Should losses arising from an earthquake cause a deficit in the CEA, an additional $\n2.5\n billion would be obtained from the proceeds of revenue bonds the CEA may issue, an existing $\n8.5\n billion reinsurance layer, $\n1.0\n billion from policy surcharge, and finally, if needed, assessments on participating insurance companies. Participating insurers are required to pay an assessment, currently estimated not to exceed $\n1.7\n billion, if the capital of the \n158      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nCEA falls below $\n350\n million. Within the limits previously described, the assessment could be intended to restore the CEA’s capital to a level of $\n350\n million. There is no provision that allows insurers to recover assessments through a premium surcharge or other mechanism. The CEA’s projected aggregate claim paying capacity is $\n19.7\n billion as of September 30, 2024, and if an event were to result in claims greater than its capacity, affected policyholders may be paid a prorated portion of their covered losses, paid on an installment basis, or no payments may be made if the claim paying capacity of the CEA is insufficient.\nAll future assessments on participating CEA insurers are based on their share of the total CEA premiums written as of December 31 of the preceding year. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s market share of the total CEA premiums written was \n7.9\n%. At the current level, the Company’s maximum possible CEA assessment was $\n131\n million during 2024. These amounts are re-evaluated by the board of directors of the CEA on an annual basis. Accordingly, assessments from the CEA for a particular quarter or annual period may be material to the results of operations and cash flows, but not the financial position of the Company. Management believes the Company’s exposure to earthquake losses in California has been significantly reduced as a result of its participation in the CEA.\nCalifornia FAIR Plan Association  \nThe California FAIR Plan Association (“FAIR Plan”) is a syndicated fire insurance pool that provides coverage to California homeowners who are unable to find insurance in the voluntary market. FAIR Plan members are all insurers licensed to provide property and casualty insurance coverage in the state of California. Each member participates in the profits, losses and expenses of the FAIR Plan in direct proportion to its market share of business written in the state during the second preceding calendar year. \nAs of June 30, 2024, the FAIR Plan ‘s capital balance was approximately $\n385\n million. Should losses arising from fires cause a deficit to the FAIR Plan, the FAIR Plan will assess member companies, as described further below, and collect proceeds from reinsurance placed. The FAIR Plan has placed reinsurance of $\n5.72\n billion of loss less retention of $\n900\n million. The FAIR Plan participates in co-reinsurance above $\n900\n million and is further subject to reinstatement premium. Up to $\n2.28\n billion, net of reinstatement premium, would be obtained from reinsurance. \nIf the FAIR Plan is unable to pay losses during a catastrophe event, it may seek regulatory approval to assess member companies based on their market share during the second preceding calendar year. On February 11, 2025, the FAIR Plan received regulatory approval to assess member insurers $\n1.00\n billion. The Company’s personal lines and commercial lines average market share used for the assessment was \n4.6\n% and \n2.0\n%, respectively, net of credits. Members are allowed to request the state insurance commission’s prior approval to collect temporary supplemental fees from policyholders in the state in \norder to recoup amounts assessed. Insurers can request recoupment for \n50\n% of their portion of assessments up to $\n1\n billion and \n100\n% thereafter for each residential property and commercial property insurance.\nThe Company’s reinsurance program is designed to provide reinsurance protection for catastrophes resulting from multiple perils, including fires. Note 12 includes a summary of the Company’s reinsurance program. Several of the Company’s core traditional markets per occurrence agreements provide for the inclusion of non-recoupable assessments as part of the definition of loss.   \nTexas Windstorm Insurance Association  \nThe Company participates as a member of the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (“TWIA”), which provides wind and hail property coverage to coastal risks unable to procure coverage in the voluntary market. Wind and hail coverage is written on a TWIA-issued policy. TWIA follows a funding structure first utilizing currently available funds set aside from current and prior years. Under the current law, to the extent losses exceed premiums received from policyholders, TWIA utilizes a combination of reinsurance, TWIA-issued securities, as well as member and policyholder assessments to fund loss payments. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s participation rate in TWIA was \n12.8\n%. \nAny assessments from TWIA for a particular quarter or annual period may be material to the results of operations and cash flows, but not to the financial position of the Company.\nNorth Carolina Joint Underwriters Association  \nThe North Carolina Joint Underwriters Association (“NCJUA”) was created to provide property insurance for properties, other than the state’s beach and coastal areas, that insurers are not otherwise willing to insure. All insurers licensed to write property insurance in North Carolina are members of the NCJUA. Premiums, losses and expenses of the NCJUA are shared by the member companies in proportion to their respective North Carolina property insurance writings. Member companies participate in deficits or surpluses based on their participation ratios, which are determined annually. The Company had a $\n9\n million receivable from the NCJUA on December 31, 2024 representing its participation in the NCJUA’s surplus of $\n31\n million for all open years.\nNorth Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association  \nThe North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association (“NCIUA”) provides property insurance, including windstorm coverage, for properties located in the state’s beach and coastal areas that insurers are not otherwise willing to insure. All insurers licensed to write residential and commercial property insurance in North Carolina are members of the NCIUA. Members are assessed in proportion to their North Carolina residential and commercial property insurance writings, which is determined annually and varies by coverage, for plan deficits. As of December 31, 2024, the NCIUA had a surplus of $\n1.28\n billion. No member company is entitled to the distribution of any portion of \nThe Allstate Corporation      159\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nthe NCIUA’s surplus. Legislation in 2009 capped insurers’ assessments for losses incurred in any calendar year at $\n1.00\n billion. Subsequent to an industry assessment of $\n1.00\n billion, if the NCIUA continues to require funding, it may authorize insurers to assess a \n10\n% catastrophe recovery charge on each property insurance policy statewide to be remitted to the NCIUA.\nOther programs\n  The Company is also subject to assessments by the NCRF and the FHCF, which are described in Note 12.\nGuaranty funds\nUnder state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Amounts assessed to each company are typically related to its proportion of business written in each state. The Company’s policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domicile’s statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. In most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction. In certain states there must also be a final order of liquidation. Since most states allow a credit against premium or other state related taxes for assessments, an asset is recorded based on paid and accrued assessments for the amount the Company expects to recover on the respective state’s tax return and is realized over the period allowed by each state. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the liability balance included in other liabilities and accrued expenses was $\n13\n million and $\n23\n million, respectively. There were \nno\n related premium tax offsets included in other assets as of December 31, 2024 and $\n5\n million as of December 31, 2023. \nGuarantees\nIn the normal course of business, the Company provides standard indemnifications to contractual counterparties in connection with numerous transactions, including acquisitions and divestitures. The types of indemnifications typically provided include indemnifications for breaches of representations and warranties, taxes and certain other liabilities, such as third-party lawsuits. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment of the risk of loss. The terms of the indemnifications vary in duration and nature. In many cases, the maximum obligation is not explicitly stated and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur. Consequently, the maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications is not determinable. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments pursuant to these obligations.\nRelated to the sale of ALNY on October 1, 2021, AIC agreed to indemnify Wilton Reassurance Company in connection with certain representations, warranties and covenants of AIC, and certain liabilities specifically excluded from the transaction, subject to specific contractual limitations regarding AIC’s maximum obligation. Management does not believe these indemnifications will have a material effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.\nRelated to the sale of ALIC and Allstate Assurance Company on November 1, 2021, AIC and Allstate Financial Insurance Holdings Corporation (collectively, the “Sellers”) agreed to indemnify Everlake US Holdings Company in connection with certain representations, warranties and covenants of the Sellers, and certain liabilities specifically excluded from the transaction, subject to specific contractual limitations regarding the Sellers’ maximum obligation. Management does not believe these indemnifications will have a material effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.\nThe aggregate liability balance related to all guarantees was immaterial as of December 31, 2024.\nRegulation and compliance\nThe Company is subject to extensive laws, regulations, administrative directives, and regulatory actions. From time to time, regulatory authorities or legislative bodies seek to influence and restrict premium rates, require premium refunds to policyholders, require reinstatement of terminated policies, prescribe rules or guidelines on how affiliates compete in the marketplace, restrict the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew policies, require insurers to continue to write new policies or limit their ability to write new policies, limit insurers’ ability to change coverage terms or to impose underwriting standards, impose additional regulations regarding agency and broker compensation, regulate the nature of and amount of investments, impose fines and penalties for unintended errors or mistakes, impose additional regulations regarding cybersecurity and privacy, and otherwise expand overall regulation of insurance products and the insurance industry. In addition, the Company is subject to laws and regulations administered and enforced by federal agencies, international agencies, and other organizations, including but not limited to the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the U.S. Department of Justice. The Company has established procedures and policies to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations, to foster prudent business operations, and to support financial reporting. The Company routinely reviews its practices to validate compliance with laws and regulations and with internal procedures and policies. As a result of these reviews, from time to time the Company may decide to modify some of its procedures and policies. Such modifications, and the reviews that led to them, may be accompanied by payments being made and costs being incurred. The ultimate changes and eventual \n160      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \neffects of these actions on the Company’s business, if any, are uncertain.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries\nThe Company and certain subsidiaries are involved in a number of lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings arising out of various aspects of its business.\nBackground\n  These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities, including the underlying facts of each matter; novel legal issues; variations between jurisdictions in which matters are being litigated, heard, or investigated; changes in assigned judges; differences or developments in applicable laws and judicial interpretations; judges reconsidering prior rulings; the length of time before many of these matters might be resolved by settlement, through litigation, or otherwise; adjustments with respect to anticipated trial schedules and other proceedings; developments in similar actions against other companies; the fact that some of the lawsuits are putative class actions in which a class has not been certified and in which the purported class may not be clearly defined; the fact that some of the lawsuits involve multi-state class actions in which the applicable law(s) for the claims at issue is in dispute and therefore unclear; and the challenging legal environment faced by corporations and insurance companies.\nThe outcome of these matters may be affected by decisions, verdicts and settlements, and the timing of such decisions, verdicts and settlements, in other individual and class action lawsuits that involve the Company, other insurers or other entities and by other legal, governmental and regulatory actions that involve the Company, other insurers or other entities. The outcome may also be affected by future state or federal legislation, the timing or substance of which cannot be predicted.\nIn the lawsuits, plaintiffs seek a variety of remedies which may include equitable relief in the form of injunctive and other remedies and monetary relief in the form of contractual and extra-contractual damages. In some cases, the monetary damages sought may include punitive or treble damages. Often specific information about the relief sought, such as the amount of damages, is not available because plaintiffs have not requested specific relief in their pleadings. When specific monetary demands are made, they are often set just below a state court jurisdictional limit in order to seek the maximum amount available in state court, regardless of the specifics of the case, while still avoiding the risk of removal to federal court. In Allstate’s experience, monetary demands in pleadings bear little relation to the ultimate loss, if any, to the Company.\nIn connection with regulatory examinations and proceedings, government authorities may seek various forms of relief, including penalties, restitution and changes in business practices. The Company may not \nbe advised of the nature and extent of relief sought until the final stages of the examination or proceeding.\nAccrual and disclosure policy\n  The Company reviews its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. The Company establishes accruals for such matters at management’s best estimate when the Company assesses that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not establish accruals for such matters when the Company does not believe both that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company’s assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals. The Company does not include potential recoveries in its estimates of reasonably possible or probable losses. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company continues to monitor its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and other legal proceedings for further developments that would make the loss contingency both probable and estimable and accordingly accruable, or that could affect the amount of accruals that have been previously established. There may continue to be exposure to loss in excess of any amount accrued. Disclosure of the nature and amount of an accrual is made when there have been sufficient legal and factual developments such that the Company’s ability to resolve the matter would not be impaired by the disclosure of the amount of accrual.\nWhen the Company assesses it is reasonably possible or probable that a loss has been incurred, it discloses the matter. When it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, for the matters disclosed, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed. Disclosure is not required when an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be made.\nFor certain of the matters described below in the “Claims related proceedings” and “Other proceedings” subsections, the Company is able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any. In determining whether it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, the Company reviews and evaluates the disclosed matters, in conjunction with counsel, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments.\nThese developments may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, information obtained from other sources, experience from managing these and other matters and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. When the Company possesses sufficient appropriate information to develop an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, but such an estimate \nThe Allstate Corporation      161\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nis not possible. Disclosure of the estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, for any individual matter would only be considered when there have been sufficient legal and factual developments such that the Company’s ability to resolve the matter would not be impaired by the disclosure of the individual estimate.\nThe Company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if any, for the disclosed matters where such an estimate is possible is \nzero\n to $\n70\n million, pre-tax. This disclosure is not an indication of expected loss, if any. Under accounting guidance, an event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” and an event is “remote” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.” This estimate is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimate will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. The estimate does not include matters or losses for which an estimate is not possible. Therefore, this estimate represents an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Company’s maximum possible loss exposure. Information is provided below regarding the nature of all of the disclosed matters and, where specified, the amount, if any, of plaintiff claims associated with these loss contingencies.\nDue to the complexity and scope of the matters disclosed in the “Claims related proceedings” and “Other proceedings” subsections below and the many uncertainties that exist, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted and in the Company’s judgment, a loss, in excess of amounts accrued, if any, is not probable. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued, if any, and may be material to the Company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period. However, based on information currently known to it, management believes that the ultimate outcome of all matters described below, as they are resolved over time, is not likely to have a material effect on the financial position of the Company.\nClaims related proceedings  \nThe Company is defending putative class actions in various courts that raise challenges to the Company’s depreciation practices in homeowner property claims. In these lawsuits, plaintiffs generally allege that, when calculating actual cash value, the costs of “non-materials” such as labor, general contractor’s overhead and profit, and sales tax should not be subject to depreciation. The Company is currently defending the following lawsuits on this issue:\n Sims, et al. v. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company, et al.\n (W.D. Tex. filed June 2022); \nThompson, et al. v. Allstate Insurance Company\n (Circuit Court of Cole Co., Mo. filed June 2022); \nHill v. Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Compan\ny (Circuit Court of Cole Co., Mo. filed October \n2022); and\n Hernandez v. Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company\n (D. Ariz. filed April 2023). No classes have been certified in any of these matters.\nThe Company is defending putative class actions pending in multiple states alleging that the Company underpays total loss vehicle physical damage claims on auto policies. The alleged systematic underpayments result from the following theories: (a) the third-party valuation tool used by the Company as part of a comprehensive adjustment process is allegedly flawed, biased, or contrary to applicable law; and/or (b) the Company allegedly does not pay sales tax, title fees, registration fees, and/or other specified fees that are allegedly mandatory under policy language or state legal authority.\nThe Company is currently defending the following lawsuits: \nKronenberg v. Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company\n (E.D.N.Y. filed December 2018); \nDurgin v. Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company\n (W.D. La. filed June 2019); \nGolla v. Allstate Insurance Company\n (N.D. Ohio filed June 2023); \nBibbs v. Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company\n (N.D.

(Circuit Court of Pulaski Co., Ark. filed May 2024); \nand Schott v. Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company \n(M.D. Ga. filed October 2024).\n \nNo classes have been certified in any of these matters.\nSettlements have been reached in the following cases: \nBass v. Imperial Fire and Casualty Insurance Company\n (W.D. La. filed February 2022); and \nCummings v. Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company\n (M.D. La. filed April 2022).\nThe Company is defending putative class actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona that allege underpayment of uninsured/underinsured motorist claims. The lawsuits are \nDorazio v. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company\n and \nLoughran v. MIC General Insurance Corporation, \neach\n \nfiled December 2022. The plaintiffs allege that uninsured/underinsured motorist coverages must be stacked, which is combining separate uninsured/underinsured coverage limits of multiple vehicles into one higher coverage limit, where the defendants allegedly did not include specified policy language and did not provide specified notice to policyholders. No classes have been certified in these matters. In July 2023, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a ruling in \nFranklin v. CSAA General Insurance\n, a matter involving another insurer. The \nFranklin\n decision held, under the factual circumstances of that case, that stacking of uninsured/underinsured motorist coverages was required because the insurer did not include specified policy language and did not issue specified notice.\nOther proceedings \n The Company is defending \ntwo\n putative class actions in the U.S. District Court for the \n162      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nEastern District of California, \nHolland Hewitt v. Allstate Life Insurance Company\n filed May 2020 and \nFarley v. Lincoln Benefit Life\n \nCompany \n(“LBL”) filed December 2020, following the sale of ALIC. On April 19, 2023, the district court certified a class in \nFarley. \nLBL is appealing the district court’s order in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 27, 2024, the Magistrate Judge issued his Findings and Recommendations denying class certification in \nHewitt. \nPlaintiffs filed their objection to the Magistrate’s recommendation. In these cases, plaintiffs generally allege that the defendants failed to comply with certain California statutes which address contractual grace periods and lapse notice requirements for certain life insurance policies. Plaintiffs claim that these statutes apply to life insurance policies that existed before the statutes’ effective date. The plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief. Similar litigation is pending against other insurance carriers. In August 2021, the California Supreme Court in \nMcHugh v. Protective Life\n, a matter involving another insurer, determined that the statutory notice requirements apply to life insurance policies issued before the statutes’ effective date. The Company asserts various defenses to plaintiffs’ claims and to class certification.\nThe Company is defending a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, \nChavez v. Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company\n, filed February 2022, where plaintiffs generally allege that Allstate’s Shelter-in-Place Payback program provided insufficient premium relief in response to the reduction \nin driving in California during the state’s COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in 2020 and 2021. Plaintiffs seek damages that include additional premium refunds and punitive damages. On June 25, 2024, the court issued an order granting plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The Company continues to defend the litigation and oppose plaintiffs’ allegations.\nOn July 24, 2024, the Department of Justice filed a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against National General Holdings Corp., National General Insurance Company, National General Lender Services, Inc. and Newport Management Corp. The suit alleges that certain services that National General provided as a vendor to a large national bank for its collateral protection insurance program violated the Financial Institutions, Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (the “Act”), and it seeks civil monetary penalties available under the Act.\nThe Company is subject to lawsuits related to the collection and use of driving behavior data, including a civil lawsuit filed by the Texas Attorney General in Montgomery County, Texas District Court and putative class action lawsuits filed in federal court. The lawsuits allege privacy and consumer protection claims and seek actual, statutory and punitive damages, restitution, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees.\nNote 17\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company and its eligible domestic subsidiaries file a U.S. consolidated federal income tax return. The Company also files tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax liabilities and benefits realized by the consolidated group are allocated as generated by the respective entities.\nDeferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through income tax expense (benefit) as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted.\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\n  The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contains several tax-related provisions, was signed into law in August 2022. The law establishes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) for certain large corporations and an excise tax of 1% on stock repurchases by publicly traded U.S. corporations, both effective after December 31, 2022. The excise tax on common stock repurchases is classified as an additional cost of the stock acquired included in treasury stock in shareholders' equity. The Company has determined \nthat it is considered an “applicable corporation” under the rules of CAMT.\n15% Global Minimum Tax  \nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) secured agreement from nearly 140 countries to address how corporate profits are taxed for multinational enterprises (“MNEs”). OECD has released Pillar Two Model Rules, a 15% minimum effective tax rate (also known as the Global Anti-Base Erosion “GloBE” Rules), designed to ensure that large MNEs pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they operate and mandates sharing of certain company information with taxing authorities on a local and global basis.\nThe Company is within the scope of OECD Pillar Two model rules, and certain jurisdictions where the Company operates have enacted their respective tax law to comply with the Pillar Two framework beginning on or after December 31, 2023. The Company does not expect the impact to be material to its results of operations. The Company continues to evaluate the impact as additional jurisdictions adopt their own legislation.\nRegulatory tax examinations  \nOn January 4, 2021 and October 1, 2021, the Company acquired National General and SafeAuto, respectively. For tax years prior to these acquisitions, National General is under a separate audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The IRS has completed its examination of Allstate’s tax \nThe Allstate Corporation      163\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nyears prior to 2017 and National General’s tax years prior to 2015. Currently, the IRS has concluded its examinations for the 2017 and 2018 tax years with a refund claim under review by the Joint Committee on Taxation. In addition, National General is currently under examination for the 2015 through 2019 tax years with the appeals process pending for certain disputed issues related to these years. The Company believes that adequate provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for any potential adjustments that may result from IRS examinations or any other tax authorities related to all open tax years.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\n  The Company recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\nReconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits\n For the years ended December 31,\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance – beginning of year\n$\n45\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n17\n \n(Decrease) increase for tax positions taken in a prior year\n(\n4\n)\n23\n \n—\n \nIncrease for tax positions taken in the current year\n—\n \n5\n \n—\n \nBalance – end of year\n$\n41\n \n$\n45\n \n$\n17\n \nThe Company believes that the unrecognized tax benefits balance will not materially change within the next twelve months.\nThe Company recognizes interest expense related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense (benefit) and penalties in operating costs and expenses.\n For the year ended December 31, 2024, a reduction of penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $(\n4\n) million was recorded. There were \nno\n penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits in \n2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a liability for penalties of $\n3\n million and $\n7\n million, respectively.  \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, interest expense (benefit) related to unrecognized tax benefits of $(\n2\n) million, $\n7\n million, and $\n3\n million was recorded, respectively.

Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment, as well as limitations on use in future periods. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has U.S. Federal, state and foreign net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards. Management \nbelieves that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain NOL carryforwards will not be fully realized.

Prescribed statutory accounting practices include a variety of publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices not so prescribed.\nAll states require domiciled insurance companies to prepare statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, subject to any deviations prescribed or permitted by the applicable insurance commissioner or director. Statutory accounting practices differ from GAAP primarily since they require charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing life insurance reserves based on different actuarial assumptions, and valuing certain investments and establishing deferred taxes on a different basis.\nThe Allstate Corporation      165\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nStatutory net income (loss) and capital and surplus of Allstate’s domestic insurance subsidiaries\nNet income (loss)\nCapital and surplus\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\nAmounts by major business type:\nProperty and casualty insurance\n$\n4,158\n \n$\n(\n487\n)\n$\n(\n1,653\n)\n$\n18,243\n \n$\n14,250\n \nLife, accident and health insurance\n61\n \n61\n \n70\n \n392\n \n310\n \nAmount per statutory accounting practices\n$\n4,219\n \n$\n(\n426\n)\n$\n(\n1,583\n)\n$\n18,635\n \n$\n14,560\n \nDividend limitations\nThere are no regulatory restrictions that limit the payment of dividends by the Corporation, except those generally applicable to corporations incorporated in Delaware. Dividends are payable only out of certain components of shareholders’ equity as permitted by Delaware law. However, the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends is dependent on business conditions, income, cash requirements of the Company, receipt of dividends primarily from AIC and other relevant factors.\nThe payment of shareholder dividends by AIC without the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance (“IL DOI”) is limited to formula amounts based on net income and capital and surplus, determined in conformity with statutory accounting practices, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. There were \nno\n dividends paid by AIC in 2024. The maximum amount of dividends AIC will be able to pay without prior IL DOI approval at a given point in time during 2025 is $\n3.95\n billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. The payment of a dividend in excess of this amount requires \n30\n days advance written notice to the IL DOI. The dividend is deemed approved, unless the IL DOI disapproves it within the \n30\n-day notice period. Additionally, any dividend must be paid out of unassigned surplus excluding unrealized appreciation from investments, which for AIC totaled $\n11.27\n billion as of December 31, 2024, and cannot result in capital and surplus being less than the minimum amount required by law.\nUnder state insurance laws, insurance companies are required to maintain paid up capital of not less \nthan the minimum capital requirement applicable to the types of insurance they are authorized to write. Insurance companies are also subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements adopted by state insurance regulators. A company’s “authorized control level RBC” is calculated using various factors applied to certain financial balances and activity. Companies that do not maintain adjusted statutory capital and surplus at a level in excess of the company action level RBC, which is \ntwo\n times authorized control level RBC, are required to notify and file a RBC remediation plan to the domiciliary regulator and provide a copy of the remediation plan to state insurance regulators in which the insurer is authorized to do business. Company action level RBC is significantly in excess of the minimum capital requirements. Total adjusted statutory capital and surplus and authorized control level RBC of AIC were $\n16.27\n billion and $\n3.84\n billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. Many of the Corporation’s insurance subsidiaries are subsidiaries of or reinsure all of their business to AIC. AIC’s subsidiaries are included as a component of AIC’s total statutory capital and surplus. \nThe amount of restricted net assets, as represented by the Corporation’s investment in its insurance subsidiaries, was $\n25.49\n billion as of December 31, 2024.\nIntercompany transactions\nNotification and approval of intercompany lending activities is also required by the IL DOI for transactions that exceed a level that is based on a formula using statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus.\nNote 19\nBenefit Plans\nPension and other postretirement plans\nApproximately \n90\n% of the Company’s benefit obligation relates to its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, which covers most U.S. employees. Benefits under the U.S. pension plans are based upon the employee’s length of service, eligible annual compensation and, prior to January 1, 2014, either a cash balance or final average pay formula. A cash balance formula applies to all eligible employees hired after August 1, 2002. Eligible employees hired before August 1, 2002 chose between the cash balance formula and the final average pay formula. In July 2013, the Company amended its primary plans effective January 1, 2014 to introduce a new cash balance formula to replace the previous formulas (including the final average pay formula and the previous cash balance formula) under which eligible employees \naccrue benefits. As of December 31, 2024, \n79\n% of the benefit obligation of our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan is related to the former final average pay formula.\nThe Company also provides a medical coverage subsidy for eligible employees hired before January 1, 2003, including their eligible dependents, when they retire and certain life insurance benefits for eligible retirees (“postretirement benefits”). Effective January 1, 2021, the Company eliminated the medical coverage subsidy for employees who were not eligible to retire as of December 31, 2020.\nCertain employees may become eligible for a medical subsidy if they retire in accordance with the terms of the applicable plans and are insured under the Company’s group plans or other approved plans in \n166      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \naccordance with the plan’s participation requirements. The Company shares the cost of retiree medical benefits with non-Medicare-eligible retirees based on years of service, with the Company’s share being subject to a \n5\n% limit on future annual medical cost inflation after retirement. For Medicare-eligible retirees, the Company provides a fixed Company contribution based on years of service and other factors, which is not subject to adjustments for inflation.\nThe Company has reserved the right to modify or terminate its benefit plans at any time and for any reason.\nObligations and funded status\nThe Company calculates benefit obligations based upon generally accepted actuarial methodologies using the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) for \npension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) for other postretirement plans. Pension costs and other postretirement obligations are determined using a December 31 measurement date. The benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed to employee service rendered as of the measurement date. The PBO is measured using the pension benefit formulas and assumptions. A plan’s funded status is calculated as the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The Company’s funding policy for the pension plans is to make contributions at a minimum level that is at least in accordance with regulations under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) and generally accepted actuarial principles. The Company’s other postretirement benefit plans are not funded.\nChange in benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status\nAs of December 31,\nPension\nbenefits\nPostretirement\nbenefits\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nChange in benefit obligation\nBenefit obligation, beginning of year\n$\n4,584\n \n$\n4,511\n \n$\n185\n \n$\n203\n \nService cost\n80\n \n132\n \n—\n \n1\n \nInterest cost\n230\n \n239\n \n9\n \n10\n \nParticipant contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n13\n \n16\n \nRemeasurement of benefit obligation (gains) losses\n(\n125\n)\n125\n \n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\nBenefits paid\n(\n329\n)\n(\n379\n)\n(\n37\n)\n(\n42\n)\nTranslation adjustment and other\n1\n \n(\n44\n)\n(\n3\n)\n1\n \nBenefit obligation, end of year\n$\n4,441\n \n$\n4,584\n \n$\n163\n \n$\n185\n \nChange in plan assets\nFair value of plan assets, beginning of year\n$\n4,440\n \n$\n4,430\n \nActual return on plan assets\n214\n \n418\n \nEmployer contribution\n45\n \n14\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n329\n)\n(\n379\n)\nTranslation adjustment and other\n(\n2\n)\n(\n43\n)\nFair value of plan assets, end of year\n$\n4,368\n \n$\n4,440\n \nFunded status \n(1) \n$\n(\n73\n)\n$\n(\n144\n)\n$\n(\n163\n)\n$\n(\n185\n)\nAmounts recognized in AOCI\nUnamortized pension and other postretirement prior service credit\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n15\n)\n$\n(\n18\n)\n(1)\nThe funded status is recorded within other liabilities and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nChanges in items not yet recognized as a component of net cost for pension and other postretirement plans\n($ in millions)\nPension benefits\nPostretirement benefits\nItems not yet recognized as a component of net cost – December 31, 2023\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n18\n)\nPrior service credit amortized to net cost\n—\n \n1\n \nTranslation adjustment and other\n—\n \n2\n \nItems not yet recognized as a component of net cost – December 31, 2024\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n15\n)\nThe prior service credit is recognized as a component of net cost for pension and other postretirement plans amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n4.36\n billion and \n$\n4.48\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The PBGC insures defined benefit plans offered by private-sector employers. PBGC premiums are required to be paid annually and are calculated using a predefined calculation that includes interest rates to discount a plan’s vested benefits. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company’s defined benefit pension plan elected to use an alternative methodology to calculate the prescribed interest rate in determining premiums for plan year 2023, which resulted in a refund of $\n38\n million in previously paid premiums.\nInterest cost is the increase in the PBO over the period, resulting from the passage of time and calculated using the discount rate. Interest cost fluctuates as the discount rate changes and is also impacted by the related change in the size of the PBO.\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined as the product of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the fair value of plan assets. \nPension and other postretirement service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service credit and curtailment gains and losses are reported in \nproperty and casualty insurance claims and claims expense, operating costs and expenses, net investment income and (if applicable) restructuring and related charges\n on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRemeasurement gains and losses relate to changes in discount rates, the differences between actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and differences between actual plan experience and actuarial assumptions.\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net pension cost and net postretirement benefit cost\nFor the years ended December 31,\nPension benefits\nPostretirement benefits\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n5.36\n \n%\n5.65\n \n%\n4.27\n \n%\n5.30\n \n%\n5.66\n \n%\n4.24\n \n%\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n7.34\n \n7.35\n \n7.06\n \nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nCash balance interest credit rate\n4.25\n \n4.05\n \n2.74\n \nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations\nAs of December 31,\nPension benefits\nPostretirement benefits\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nDiscount rate\n5.71\n \n%\n5.35\n \n%\n5.50\n \n%\n5.28\n \n%\nCash balance interest credit rate\n4.78\n \n4.03\n \nn/a\nn/a\nThe weighted average health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement \nbenefit cost is \n6.8\n% for 2025, gradually declining to \n4.5\n% in 2035 and remaining at that level thereafter.\n168      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K  \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nPension plan assets\n  In general, the Company’s pension plan assets are managed in accordance with investment policies approved by pension investment committees. The purpose of the policies is to ensure the plans’ long-term ability to meet benefit obligations by prudently investing plan assets and Company contributions, while taking into consideration regulatory and legal requirements and current market conditions. The investment policies are reviewed periodically and specify target plan asset allocation by asset category. In addition, the policies specify various asset allocation and other risk limits. The target asset allocation takes the plans’ funding status into consideration, among other factors, including anticipated demographic changes or liquidity \nrequirements that may affect the funding status such as the potential impact of lump sum settlements as well as existing or expected market conditions. In general, the allocation has a lower overall investment risk when a plan is in a stronger funded status position since there is less economic incentive to take risk to increase the expected returns on the plan assets. The pension plans’ asset exposure within each asset category is tracked against widely accepted established benchmarks for each asset class with limits on variation from the benchmark established in the investment policy. Pension plan assets are regularly monitored for compliance with these limits and other risk limits specified in the investment policies.\nPension plan weighted average target asset allocation by asset category \n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024\nEquity securities\n25\n% - \n42\n%\nFixed income securities\n53\n% - \n69\n%\nLimited partnership interests\n1\n% - \n28\n%\nShort-term investments and other\nNA\nBank loans\n0\n% - \n12\n%\n(1)\nThe target asset allocation considers risk-based exposure including exposure provided through derivatives.\nThe target asset allocation for an asset category may be achieved either through direct investment holdings, through replication using derivative instruments (e.g., futures or swaps) or net of hedges using derivative instruments to reduce exposure to an asset category. The net notional amount of derivatives used for replication and non-hedging strategies is limited to \n130\n% of total U.S. plan assets. Derivatives are not used to increase portfolio exposure above asset allocation limits. Market performance of the different asset categories may, from time to time, cause \ndeviation from the target asset allocation. The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis and rebalanced to bring the allocation within the target ranges.\nOutside the target asset allocation, the pension plans participate in a securities lending program to enhance returns.

The Company’s assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is evaluated annually giving consideration to appropriate data including, but not limited to, the plan asset allocation, forward-looking expected returns for the period over which benefits will be paid, historical returns on plan assets and other relevant market data. Given the long-term forward-looking nature of this assumption, the actual returns in any one year do not immediately result in a change to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In consideration of the targeted plan asset allocation, the Company evaluated expected returns using sources including: historical average asset class returns from independent nationally recognized providers of this type of data blended together using the asset allocation policy weights for the Company’s pension plans; asset class return forecasts developed by employees with relevant expertise in such forecasts and who are independent from those charged with managing the pension plan assets; and expected portfolio returns from a proprietary simulation methodology of a widely recognized external investment consulting firm that performs asset \nallocation and actuarial services for corporate pension plan sponsors. The above sources support the Company’s weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of \n7.34\n% used for 2024 and an estimate of \n7.58\n% that will be used for 2025. As of the 2024 measurement date, the arithmetic average of the annual actual return on plan assets for the most recent \n10\n and \n5\n years was \n7.8\n% and \n6.0\n%, respectively.\nCash flows\n There was no required cash contribution necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirement under the IRC for the tax qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The Company uses its treasury shares for these issuances.\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. In addition, separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility of the price of the underlying shares is implied based on traded options and historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The expected dividends were based on the current dividend yield of the Company’s stock as of the date of the grant. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. \nOptions\n are granted to employees with exercise prices equal to the closing share price of the Company’s common stock on the applicable grant date.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A\n.\n Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n176      www.allstate.com\n2024 Form 10-K\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nReserve for Property and Casualty Insurance Claims and Claims Expense - Refer to Notes 2 and 10 to the Financial Statements \nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company establishes reserves for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense on reported and unreported claims of insured losses. Using established industry and actuarial practices as well as the Company’s historical claims experience, the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense is estimated based on (i) claims reported, (ii) claims incurred but not reported, and (iii) projections of claim payments to be made in the future.\nGiven the subjectivity of estimating claims incurred but not reported and projections of claim payments to be made in the future, particularly those with payout requirements over a longer period of time, the related audit effort in evaluating the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including involvement of our actuarial specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures related to the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense included the following:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense, including those over the Company’s estimates and projections.\n•\nWe evaluated the methods and assumptions used by the Company to estimate the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense by:\n–\nTesting the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, including historical claims, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate.\n–\nPerforming a retrospective review, including comparing prior year estimates of expected incurred losses to actual experience during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense.\n•\nWith the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we developed independent estimates for the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense, particularly those with payout requirements over a longer period of time, utilizing loss data or industry claim development factors, and compared our estimates to management’s estimates and assessed the consistency of management’s approach.\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 24, 2025\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1992.\nThe Allstate Corporation      177\n2024 Form 10-K\n \nItem 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A.  Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\n \n We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
