This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 items. This section also discusses Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 results, as the Company revised its Fiscal 2024 items to correct for a misstatement in its financial statements discovered during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025. The revisions ensure comparability across all periods reflected herein. For additional information, see Note 1 and Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nIn addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs, and that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all results presented are prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Unless otherwise indicated, all changes identified for the current-period results represent comparisons to results for the prior corresponding fiscal period.\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “Dell Technologies” mean Dell Technologies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, references to “Dell” mean Dell Inc. and Dell Inc.’s consolidated subsidiaries, and references to “EMC” mean EMC Corporation and EMC Corporation’s consolidated subsidiaries.\nOur fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday nearest January 31. We refer to our fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023 as “Fiscal 2025,” “Fiscal 2024,” and “Fiscal 2023,” respectively. Both Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 included 52 weeks, while Fiscal 2023 included 53 weeks.\nINTRODUCTION\nCompany Overview\nDell Technologies is a leader in the global technology industry focused on providing broad and innovative technology solutions for the data and artificial intelligence (“AI”) era. We build and offer solutions ranging from client devices and peripherals to infrastructure solutions across servers, networking, and storage to meet the evolving needs of our customers and drive better business outcomes. With our extensive portfolio and our commitment to innovation, we offer secure, integrated solutions that extend from the edge to the core to the cloud, and we are at the forefront of AI, software-defined, and cloud native infrastructure solutions. Our vision is to become the most essential technology partner. We intend to realize our vision by executing our strategy of leveraging our strengths to extend our leadership positions and capture new growth.\nWe are organized into two business units which are also our reportable segments: Infrastructure Solutions Group and Client Solutions Group.\n•\nInfrastructure Solutions Group (“ISG”)\n — ISG includes our servers and networking offerings and our storage offerings. Our server portfolio includes high-performance general-purpose and AI-optimized servers. Our networking portfolio includes wide area network infrastructure, data center and edge networking switches, and cables and optics. Our comprehensive storage portfolio includes modern and traditional storage solutions, including all-flash arrays, scale-out file, object platforms, hyper-converged infrastructure, and software-defined storage. ISG also offers software, peripherals, and services, including consulting and support and deployment.\n•\nClient Solutions Group (“CSG”)\n — CSG includes offerings designed for commercial and consumer customers. Our CSG portfolio includes branded PCs, including notebooks, desktops, and workstations, branded peripherals, and third-party software and peripherals. CSG also includes services offerings, such as configuration, support and deployment, and extended warranties. \n39\nTable of Contents\nOur other businesses primarily consist of our resale of standalone offerings of VMware LLC (formerly VMware, Inc. and individually and together with its subsidiaries, “VMware”), referred to as “VMware Resale,” and offerings of SecureWorks Corp. (“Secureworks”). These businesses are divested businesses or their offerings are no longer actively sold, and are not classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively. Their operating results are reported within Corporate and other. On October 21, 2024, Secureworks announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement providing for its sale to Sophos Inc., an affiliate of Thoma Bravo, L.P., a private equity and growth capital firm. The transaction was completed on February 3, 2025, subsequent to the close of the Company’s fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $0.9 billion.\nFor further discussion regarding our current reportable segments, see “Results of Operations — Business Unit Results” and Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nWe offer customers choice in how they acquire our solutions, including traditional purchasing and offerings under the Dell Payment Solutions portfolio. These offerings provide both payment and consumption solutions, including as-a-Service, subscription, utility, leases, and loans, which allow our customers to pay over time and provide them with operational and financial flexibility. Dell Financial Services and its affiliates (“DFS”) support financing solutions and services as part of the portfolio. For additional information about our financing arrangements, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. \nBusiness Trends and Challenges\nFiscal 2025 Significant Developments\n — During Fiscal 2025, we executed our strategy with strong operating results, generating net revenue and operating income growth. The following trends and conditions affected the environment in which we operated: \n•\nMacroeconomic environment:\n The demand environment was strong for our servers and networking offerings, which contributed to overall net revenue growth. Additionally, we saw modest demand improvement in our commercial offerings within CSG. Given the demand dynamics for the year, we experienced a shift in the mix of the business towards our ISG offerings.\n•\nDemand for AI-optimized solutions:\n Our ISG business continued to benefit from increased demand for AI-optimized solutions as customers continue to adopt and further integrate AI into their operations. As a result of the continued strong demand for our AI-optimized servers, backlog levels for such offerings remained elevated as we exited the fiscal year. \n•\nSupply chain: \nNotwithstanding the increased demand for AI-optimized solutions, our supply chain continued to operate efficiently. We experienced a modest increase in input costs, primarily driven by both component and logistics costs.\n•\nBroadcom’s acquisition of VMware:\n On November 22, 2023, Broadcom Inc. (“Broadcom”) completed its acquisition of VMware, leading to changes to our relationship with VMware as described below.\nWe expect demand growth across our servers and networking offerings and, to a lesser extent, our storage offerings, which we expect will result in ISG net revenue growth in Fiscal 2026. We expect modest CSG net revenue growth for the full fiscal year, driven in part by the anticipated PC refresh cycle in the latter part of Fiscal 2026. Additionally, we expect a continued reduction of our Corporate and other net revenue as we no longer act as a distributor of VMware’s standalone products and services.\nWe expect a modest decline in input costs during the first half of Fiscal 2026. Input cost trends are dependent on the strength or weakness of actual end-user demand and supply dynamics, which will continue to fluctuate and ultimately impact our costs, pricing, and operating results.\nWe remain focused on executing our key strategic priorities, building long-term value creation for our stakeholders, and addressing our customers’ needs while continuing to make prudent decisions in response to the environment. We expect margin rate pressure resulting from a continuing shift in mix towards our AI-optimized servers and a competitive environment. We look to balance profitability and growth while maintaining disciplined pricing as we navigate through competitive pricing pressures. \n40\nTable of Contents\nWe continue to advance our own capabilities to change the way we work and make decisions, improve business outcomes and the customer experience, and reduce costs by leveraging new technology and optimizing business processes. We remain committed to disciplined cost management in coordination with our ongoing business modernization initiatives and expect continued reductions in operating expenses as we take certain measures to reduce costs, including limitation of external hiring, employee reorganizations, and other actions to align our investments with our strategic priorities and customer needs. We anticipate these actions will result in additional reductions in our overall headcount. We believe our unique operating advantages provide a foundation to foster growth, drive efficiencies, and continue to position us for long-term success.\nRelationship with VMware\n \n— On November 22, 2023, VMware was acquired by Broadcom, and subsequently announced changes to its go-to-market approach for VMware offerings that impacted our commercial relationship with VMware. On March 25, 2024, we terminated our Commercial Framework Agreement with VMware, which provided the framework under which we and VMware continued our commercial relationship following our spin-off of VMware on November 1, 2021. We no longer act as a distributor of Broadcom’s VMware standalone products and services, although we will continue to support customers that have purchased resale offerings sold in prior periods. We continue to integrate and embed certain VMware products and services with selected Dell Technologies’ offerings to end-users, such as through our VxRail solution. The results of such offerings are reflected within CSG or ISG, depending upon the nature of the underlying offering sold.\nVMware was a related party until the date of its acquisition by Broadcom. The acquisition terminated the preexisting related party relationship with VMware such that no related party relationship exists with either Broadcom or VMware effective as of November 22, 2023. For more information regarding the impact of the Broadcom acquisition of VMware and our prior related party transactions with VMware, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nISG\n \n—\n We expect ISG will continue to be impacted by the evolving nature of the IT infrastructure market and competitive environment. With our scale and market-leading solutions portfolio, we believe we are well-positioned to address the ongoing competitive dynamics and trends in technology and customer needs. Through our collaborative, customer-focused approach to innovation, we strive to deliver new and relevant solutions and software to our customers quickly and efficiently. We continue to focus on customer base expansion and the lifetime value of customer relationships. \nWe anticipate ISG will continue to benefit from technology advancements and interest in AI as customers continue to adopt and integrate AI into their operations. The timing of customer purchases reflects the varying stages of adoption of AI by different customer segments and drives variability in our revenue. To meet the growing demand and increasing complexity of our AI-optimized offerings, we have increased our purchases of certain components with suppliers, which has resulted in increased inventory levels, higher purchase obligations, and new working capital dynamics. Additionally, frequent component part updates or transitions create additional challenges in managing demand and supply levels. While we have seen lead times shorten, we anticipate the next-generation of these components will be subject to supply constraints as demand for these components remains high. \nWe expect that growth in data will continue to generate long-term demand for our storage solutions and services. Cloud native applications are expected to continue to be a key trend in the infrastructure market. We continue to expand our offerings in external storage arrays, which incorporate flexible, cloud-based functionality. We benefit from offering solutions that address software-defined storage, hyper-converged infrastructure, and modular solutions based on server-centric architectures. Our storage business is subject to seasonal trends, which may continue to impact ISG results.\nCSG\n — \nWe participate in all segments of the PC market with a focus on commercial and high-end consumer computing devices, which we believe represent the most stable and profitable markets. We anticipate that CSG will benefit from advances in AI over the long-term as customers will require PCs with the ability to run their complex AI workloads. \nCompetitive dynamics remain an important factor in our CSG business and continue to impact pricing and operating results. We are committed to our long-term CSG strategy and will continue to make investments to innovate across the portfolio. We expect that the CSG demand environment will be subject to seasonal trends and influenced by the timing and scale of the anticipated PC refresh cycle.\nRecurring Revenue and Consumption Models\n \n— We expect that our flexible consumption models will further strengthen our customer relationships and provide a foundation for growth in recurring revenue. We define recurring revenue as revenue recognized that is primarily related to hardware and software maintenance, as well as operating leases, subscription, as-a-Service, and usage-based offerings.\n41\nTable of Contents\nStrategic Investments and Acquisitions\n \n— As part of our strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic investments through our venture capital investment arm, Dell Technologies Capital, with a focus on emerging technology areas that are relevant to our business and that will complement our existing portfolio of solutions. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never have commercial value, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in the companies. In addition to these investments, we may also make targeted acquisitions of businesses that advance our strategic objectives and accelerate our innovation agenda.\nForeign Currency Exposure\n — We manage our business on a U.S. Dollar basis. However, we have a large global presence, generating approximately half of our net revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024. As a result, our operating results can be, and particularly in recent periods have been, impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize a comprehensive hedging strategy intended to mitigate the impact of foreign currency volatility over time, and we adjust pricing when possible to further minimize foreign currency impacts. \nOther Macroeconomic Risks and Uncertainties\n — The impacts of trade protection measures, including increases in tariffs and trade barriers, changes in government policies and international trade arrangements, geopolitical volatility, and global macroeconomic conditions (including those in China) may affect our ability to conduct business in some non-U.S. markets. We monitor and seek to mitigate these risks with adjustments to our manufacturing, supply chain, and distribution networks.\n42\nTable of Contents\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn this management’s discussion and analysis, we use supplemental measures of our performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP product gross margin; non-GAAP services gross margin; non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating income; non-GAAP net income; non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. - diluted; free cash flow; and adjusted free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance or liquidity in isolation from or as a substitute for gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, or cash flows from operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in financial planning and forecasting and when evaluating our financial results and operating trends and performance. We believe, when used supplementally with GAAP financial measures, these non-GAAP financial measures provide our investors with useful and transparent information to help them evaluate our results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our results of operations and enabling them to make period to period comparisons. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nNon-GAAP product gross margin, non-GAAP services gross margin, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. - diluted, as defined by us, exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, other corporate expenses and, for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. - diluted, fair value adjustments on equity investments and an aggregate adjustment for income taxes. As the excluded items may have a material impact on our financial results, our management compensates for this limitation by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures supplementally or for projections when comparable GAAP financial measures are not available. \nReconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented below. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. The discussion below includes information on each of the excluded items as well as our reasons for excluding them from our non-GAAP results. In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, the exclusion of these items and other similar items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual.\nThe following is a summary of the items excluded from the most comparable GAAP financial measures to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures.\n•\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n \n—\n \nAmortization of intangible assets primarily consists of the amortization of customer relationships, developed technology, and trade names. In connection with our acquisition by merger of EMC, referred to as the “EMC merger transaction,” and the acquisition of Dell by Dell Technologies Inc., referred to as the “going-private transaction,” all of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of EMC and Dell, respectively, were accounted for and recognized at fair value on the transaction dates. We exclude amortization charges for the amortization of intangible assets as they do not reflect our current operating performance and charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and, as a result, may vary in amount from period to period.\n•\nStock-based Compensation Expense\n \n— Stock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. To estimate the fair value of performance-based awards containing a market condition, we use the Monte Carlo valuation model. For other share-based awards, the fair value is generally based on the closing price of the Class C Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, we exclude such expense because the fair value of the stock-based awards may fluctuate based on factors unrelated to the operating performance of the business and may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards.\n43\nTable of Contents\n•\nOther Corporate Expenses\n \n— Other corporate expenses consist primarily of severance expenses, payroll taxes associated with stock-based compensation, incentive charges related to equity investments, facility action costs, transaction-related expenses, and impairment charges. Severance costs are primarily related to severance and benefits for employees terminated pursuant to cost management initiatives. During Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, we recognized $0.7 billion, $0.6 billion, and $0.5 billion, respectively, of severance expense related to workforce reduction activities. During Fiscal 2023, other corporate expenses also included $0.9 billion of net expense recognized within interest and other, net, in connection with an agreement to settle the Class V transaction litigation. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for information about this matter. Transaction-related expenses typically consist of acquisition, integration, and divestitures related costs, primarily representing costs for legal, banking, consulting, and advisory services, and are expensed as incurred. Although we may incur these types of expenses in the future, we exclude other corporate expenses as they can vary from period to period, are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events, and are not used by management in assessing operating performance of the business.\n•\nFair Value Adjustments on Equity Investments\n — Fair value adjustments on equity investments primarily consist of the gain (loss) on strategic investments, which includes recurring fair value adjustments of investments in publicly-traded companies, as well as those in privately-held companies, which are adjusted for observable price changes and any potential impairments. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information on our strategic investment activity. We exclude fair value adjustments on equity investments given the volatility in ongoing adjustments to the valuation of these strategic investments and because such adjustments are unrelated to the operating performance of our business.\n•\nAggregate Adjustment for Income Taxes\n \n—\n \nThe aggregate adjustment for income taxes is the estimated combined income tax effect for the adjustments described above and determined based on the tax jurisdictions where those adjustments were incurred, as well as an adjustment for discrete tax items. During Fiscal 2025, the aggregate adjustment for income taxes included discrete tax benefits of $0.4 billion related to changes in uncertain tax benefits resulting from the expiration of certain U.S. statutes of limitations and $0.2 billion related to stock-based compensation. We exclude these benefits or charges for purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income due to the variability in recognition of discrete tax items from period to period. The tax effects are determined based on the tax jurisdictions where the above items were incurred. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information about our income taxes. Beginning in Fiscal 2025, our non-GAAP income tax was calculated using a fixed estimated annual tax rate that is determined based on historical trends and projections for the current fiscal year. We may adjust our estimated annual tax rate during the fiscal year to take into account events that would significantly impact our income tax expense, including significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in geographic mix of revenue and expenses, changes to our corporate structure, and other significant events.\n44\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for \nthe \nperiods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\n \nJanuary 31, 2025\n% Change\nFebruary 2, 2024\n% Change\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions, except percentages)\nProduct gross margin\n$\n11,258 \n— \n%\n$\n11,237 \n(15)\n%\n$\n13,221 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAmortization of intangibles\n238 \n331 \n416 \nStock-based compensation expense\n56 \n51 \n52 \nOther corporate expenses\n22 \n23 \n32 \nNon-GAAP product gross margin \n$\n11,574 \n(1)\n%\n$\n11,642 \n(15)\n%\n$\n13,721 \nServices gross margin \n$\n9,992 \n2 \n%\n$\n9,832 \n4 \n%\n$\n9,465 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nStock-based compensation expense\n96 \n98 \n100 \nOther corporate expenses\n148 \n72 \n141 \nNon-GAAP services gross margin\n$\n10,236 \n2 \n%\n$\n10,002 \n3 \n%\n$\n9,706 \nGross margin\n$\n21,250 \n1 \n%\n$\n21,069 \n(7)\n%\n$\n22,686 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAmortization of intangibles\n238 \n331 \n416 \nStock-based compensation expense\n152 \n149 \n152 \nOther corporate expenses\n170 \n95 \n173 \nNon-GAAP gross margin\n$\n21,810 \n1 \n%\n$\n21,644 \n(8)\n%\n$\n23,427 \nOperating expenses\n$\n15,013 \n(4)\n%\n$\n15,658 \n(7)\n%\n$\n16,915 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAmortization of intangibles\n(429)\n(502)\n(598)\nStock-based compensation expense\n(633)\n(729)\n(779)\nOther corporate expenses\n(670)\n(661)\n(748)\nNon-GAAP operating expenses\n$\n13,281 \n(4)\n%\n$\n13,766 \n(7)\n%\n$\n14,790 \n45\nTable of Contents\nFiscal Year Ended\n \nJanuary 31, 2025\n% Change\nFebruary 2, 2024\n% Change\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions, except percentages and per share amounts)\nOperating income\n$\n6,237 \n15 \n%\n$\n5,411 \n(6)\n%\n$\n5,771 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAmortization of intangibles\n667 \n833 \n1,014 \nStock-based compensation expense\n785 \n878 \n931 \nOther corporate expenses\n840 \n756 \n921 \nNon-GAAP operating income\n$\n8,529 \n8 \n%\n$\n7,878 \n(9)\n%\n$\n8,637 \nNet income\n$\n4,576 \n36 \n%\n$\n3,372 \n39 \n%\n$\n2,422 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAmortization of intangibles\n667 \n833 \n1,014 \nStock-based compensation expense\n785 \n878 \n931 \nOther corporate expenses\n830 \n793 \n1,796 \nFair value adjustments on equity investments\n(177)\n(47)\n206 \nAggregate adjustment for income taxes\n(816)\n(407)\n(642)\nNon-GAAP net income\n$\n5,865 \n8 \n%\n$\n5,422 \n(5)\n%\n$\n5,727 \nEarnings per share attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. — diluted\n$\n6.38 \n39 \n%\n$\n4.60 \n42 \n%\n$\n3.24 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAmortization of intangibles\n0.93 \n1.13 \n1.35 \nStock-based compensation expense\n1.09 \n1.19 \n1.24 \nOther corporate expenses\n1.16 \n1.08 \n2.39 \nFair value adjustments on equity investments\n(0.25)\n(0.06)\n0.27 \nAggregate adjustment for income taxes\n(1.15)\n(0.55)\n(0.86)\nTotal non-GAAP adjustments attributable to non-controlling interests\n(0.02)\n(0.02)\n(0.02)\nNon-GAAP earnings per share attributable to Dell Technologies Inc. — diluted\n$\n8.14 \n10 \n%\n$\n7.37 \n(3)\n%\n$\n7.61 \n46\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the above measures, we use free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as non-GAAP liquidity measures to evaluate our performance. As presented in the following table, we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations after excluding capital expenditures and capitalized software costs, net. To measure adjusted free cash flow, we exclude the impact of financing receivables and equipment under operating leases from free cash flow, as the initial funding of these DFS offerings at the time of origination is largely subsequently replaced with cash inflows from our DFS debt, the majority of which is asset-backed. \nFree cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provide useful information to management and investors in part because we use these metrics in our long-term capital allocation framework. Further, we believe free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are useful measures to management and investors because they reflect cash that we can use, among other purposes, to repurchase common stock, pay dividends on our common stock, invest in our business, pay down debt, and make strategic acquisitions.\nAs is the case with the other non-GAAP measures presented above, users should consider the limitations of using free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, including the fact that those measures do not provide a complete measure of our cash flows for any period. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not purport to be alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In particular, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management’s discretionary use, as these measures do not reflect certain cash requirements, such as debt service requirements and other contractual commitments.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to cash flow from operations for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\n% Change\nFebruary 2, 2024\n% Change\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions, except percentages)\nCash flow from operations\n$\n4,521 \n(48)\n%\n$\n8,676 \n143 \n%\n$\n3,565 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nCapital expenditures and capitalized software development costs, net (a)\n(2,563)\n(2,753)\n(2,993)\nFree cash flow\n$\n1,958 \n(67)\n%\n$\n5,923 \n935 \n%\n$\n572 \nFree cash flow\n$\n1,958 \n(67)\n%\n$\n5,923 \n935 \n%\n$\n572 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nFinancing receivables (b)\n951 \n(309)\n461 \nEquipment under operating leases (c)\n188 \n(7)\n500 \nAdjusted free cash flow\n$\n3,097 \n(45)\n%\n$\n5,607 \n266 \n%\n$\n1,533 \n____________________\n(a)\nCapital expenditures and capitalized software development costs, net includes proceeds from sales of facilities, land, and other assets.\n(b)\nFinancing receivables represent the operating cash flow impact from the change in financing receivables.\n(c)\nEquipment under operating leases represents the net impact of capital expenditures and depreciation expense for leases and contractually embedded leases identified within flexible consumption arrangements.\n47\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results for the periods indicated.

The increase in ISG net revenue was driven by growth in our servers and networking offerings. Corporate and other net revenue declined primarily due to a decrease in VMware Resale revenue as we no longer act as a distributor of standalone VMware offerings. The decline in CSG net revenue was attributable to a decrease in sales of our consumer offerings.\nDuring Fiscal 2025, operating income and non-GAAP operating income increased by 15% to $6.2 billion and 8% to $8.5 billion, respectively. During Fiscal 2025, the increases in operating income and non-GAAP operating income were primarily attributable to an increase in ISG operating income that was driven by our servers and networking offerings and, to a lesser extent, our storage offerings, which was partially offset by a decrease in CSG operating income.\nDuring Fiscal 2025, operating income and non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenue increased 40 basis points to 6.5% and remained flat at 8.9%, respectively. The operating income and non-GAAP operating income rates during the current year were affected by the favorable impact of a decrease in operating expense rate that was driven by strong ISG net revenue growth coupled with continued disciplined cost management. The favorable impact of a decrease in operating expense rate was offset by a decline in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue due to a shift in mix towards AI-optimized server offerings and a competitive CSG pricing environment.\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.5 billion during Fiscal 2025, and was driven by profitability, partially offset by working capital dynamics. Working capital was primarily impacted by AI, which led to higher inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable levels. During Fiscal 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $8.7 billion, which was primarily driven by profitability coupled with strong inventory management and cash collections performance. Cash provided by operating activities during Fiscal 2024 also reflected the impact of the $0.9 billion net payment to settle the Class V transaction litigation and $0.4 billion in proceeds from the sale of our U.S. consumer revolving customer receivables portfolio. See “Liquidity, Cash Requirements, and Market Conditions” for additional information about our cash flow metrics.\nWe continue to see opportunities to create value and grow as we respond to long-term demand for our IT solutions driven by a data- and AI-enabled world. We have demonstrated our ability to adjust to changing market conditions with complementary solutions and innovation across both segments of our business, an agile workforce, and the strength of our global supply chain. As we continue to innovate and modernize our offerings, we believe that Dell Technologies is well-positioned for long-term profitable growth.\nNet Revenue\nFiscal 2025 compared to Fiscal 2024\nDuring Fiscal 2025, net revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by an increase in ISG net revenue that was partially offset by a decrease in Corporate and other net revenue and, to a lesser extent, CSG net revenue. See “Business Unit Results” for further information.\n•\nProduct Net Revenue\n — Product net revenue includes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software licenses. During Fiscal 2025, product net revenue increased 11% due to an increase in ISG product net revenue driven by growth in our servers and networking offerings. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in CSG product net revenue as a result of a decrease in the average selling prices of our CSG offerings and, to a lesser extent, a decline in units sold within our consumer offerings, as well as a decline in Corporate and other product net revenue as we no longer act as a distributor of standalone VMware offerings.\n•\nServices Net Revenue\n \n— Services net revenue includes revenue from our services offerings and support services related to hardware products and software licenses. During Fiscal 2025, services net revenue was flat as the growth within CSG services net revenue and, to a lesser extent, ISG services net revenue was offset by a decline in Corporate and other services net revenue. The increase in CSG services net revenue was primarily due to CSG third-party software support and maintenance as well as support and maintenance associated with products sold in prior periods. The increase in ISG services net revenue was primarily due to support and maintenance associated with products sold in prior periods. Corporate and other services net revenue declined as we no longer act as a distributor of standalone VMware offerings.\n49\nTable of Contents\nA substantial portion of services net revenue is derived from offerings that have been deferred over a period of time, and, as a result, reported growth rates for services net revenue will be different than reported growth rates for product net revenue. \nFrom a geographical perspective, net revenue increased during Fiscal 2025 in the Americas and, to a lesser extent, APJ and remained flat in EMEA.\nFiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023\nDuring Fiscal 2024, net revenue decreased 14%, primarily driven by declines in CSG net revenue and, to a lesser extent, ISG net revenue. See “Business Unit Results” for further information.\n•\nProduct Net Revenue\n — During Fiscal 2024, product net revenue decreased 19% due to declines in CSG product net revenue and, to a lesser extent, ISG product net revenue. CSG product net revenue decreased primarily as a result of a decline in units sold, which impacted both our commercial and consumer offerings. The decline in ISG product net revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in product net revenue attributable to our servers and networking offerings that was driven by a decrease in units sold and, to a lesser extent, a decline in our product net revenue attributable to storage offerings. \n•\nServices Net Revenue\n \n— During Fiscal 2024, services net revenue increased 4%, driven primarily by growth within services net revenue attributable to CSG and Corporate and other. The increase in services net revenue attributable to CSG was driven primarily by third-party software support and maintenance and hardware support and maintenance. The increase in services net revenue attributable to Corporate and other was driven primarily by VMware software maintenance arrangements. See “Introduction” for additional information about the impact of Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware on our relationship with VMware. \nFrom a geographical perspective, net revenue decreased in the Americas, EMEA, and APJ during Fiscal 2024, most notably within APJ.\nGross Margin\nFiscal 2025 compared to Fiscal 2024\nDuring Fiscal 2025, both gross margin and non-GAAP gross margin increased 1%, to $21.3 billion and $21.8 billion, respectively, driven by an increase in ISG gross margin that was largely offset by a decrease in CSG gross margin. The increase in ISG gross margin was primarily attributable to growth in our AI-optimized server offerings and, to a lesser extent, our storage offerings. The decrease in CSG gross margin was primarily attributable to a competitive pricing environment.\nDuring Fiscal 2025, gross margin and non-GAAP gross margin percentage decreased 160 basis points to 22.2% and 170 basis points to 22.8%, respectively. The decreases in gross margin percentage and non-GAAP gross margin percentage were primarily driven by a shift in mix towards AI-optimized server offerings and a competitive CSG pricing environment.\n•\nProduct Gross Margin\n — During Fiscal 2025, product gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin remained flat at $11.3 billion and decreased 1% to $11.6 billion, respectively, as the decrease in CSG product gross margin was largely offset by an increase in ISG product gross margin. The decline in CSG product gross margin was primarily attributable to a competitive pricing environment. The increase in ISG product gross margin was primarily due to growth in our AI-optimized server offerings and, to a lesser extent, our storage offerings. \nDuring Fiscal 2025, product gross margin percentage and non-GAAP product gross margin percentage decreased 170 basis points to 15.8% and 190 basis points to 16.2%, respectively. The declines were primarily attributable to a shift in mix towards our AI-optimized server offerings and a competitive CSG pricing environment.\n50\nTable of Contents\n•\nServices Gross Margin\n — During Fiscal 2025, both services gross margin and non-GAAP services gross margin increased 2%, to $10.0 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively. Services gross margin and non-GAAP services gross margin benefited from an increase in support and maintenance associated with products sold in prior periods within both ISG and CSG and, to a lesser extent, an increase in CSG third-party software support and maintenance.\nDuring Fiscal 2025, services gross margin percentage and non-GAAP services gross margin percentage increased 60 basis points to 41.4% and 80 basis points to 42.4%, respectively. The increases in services gross margin percentage and non-GAAP services gross margin percentage were primarily driven by a shift in mix as we no longer act as a distributor of standalone VMware offerings.\nFiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023\nDuring Fiscal 2024, gross margin and non-GAAP gross margin decreased 7% to $21.1 billion and 8% to $21.6 billion, respectively. The declines were driven by decreases in both ISG and CSG gross margin that were primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue, the effect of which was partially offset by lower input costs.\nBoth gross margin and non-GAAP gross margin percentage increased 160 basis points, to 23.8% and 24.5%, respectively, during Fiscal 2024. The increases were primarily attributable to the impacts of an overall decline in input costs coupled with an increase in average selling prices across many of our offerings as we continued to exercise disciplined pricing in an increasingly competitive environment.\n•\nProduct Gross Margin\n — During Fiscal 2024, product gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin both decreased 15%, to $11.2 billion and $11.6 billion, respectively. The decreases were primarily driven by declines in both ISG and CSG product gross margin, which were largely attributable to declines in product net revenue, partially offset by lower input costs.\nDuring Fiscal 2024, product gross margin percentage and non-GAAP product gross margin percentage both increased 80 basis points, to 17.5% and 18.1%, respectively, primarily due to an increase in CSG product gross margin percentage. CSG product gross margin percentage increased primarily as a result of the impacts of an overall decline in input costs coupled with an increase in average selling prices across many of our product offerings.\n•\nServices Gross Margin\n — During Fiscal 2024, services gross margin and non-GAAP services gross margin increased 4% to $9.8 billion and 3% to $10.0 billion, respectively. The increases were primarily attributable to growth within ISG services gross margin and, to a lesser extent, CSG services gross margin that were driven by support and maintenance associated with products sold in prior periods.\nDuring Fiscal 2024, services gross margin percentage decreased 30 basis points to 40.8% and non-GAAP services gross margin percentage decreased 50 basis points to 41.6%. The decreases were driven primarily by a shift in mix of services delivered.\nVendor Programs\nOur gross margin is affected by our ability to achieve competitive pricing with our vendors and contract manufacturers, including through our negotiation of a variety of vendor rebate programs to achieve lower net costs for the various components we include in our products. Under these programs, vendors provide us with rebates or other discounts from the list prices for the components, which are generally elements of their pricing strategy. We account for vendor rebates and other discounts as a reduction in cost of net revenue. We manage our costs on a total net cost basis, which includes supplier list prices reduced by vendor rebates and other discounts.\nThe terms and conditions of our vendor rebate programs are largely based on product volumes and are generally negotiated either at the beginning of the annual or quarterly period, depending on the program. The timing and amount of vendor rebates and other discounts we receive under the programs may vary from period to period, reflecting changes in the competitive environment. We monitor our component costs and seek to address the effects of any changes to terms that might arise under our vendor rebate programs. Our gross margins for Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were not materially affected by any changes to the terms of our vendor rebate programs, as the amounts we received under these programs were generally stable relative to our total net cost. We are not aware of any significant changes to our vendor rebate programs that will materially impact our results in the near term.\n51\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents information regarding our operating expenses for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\nDollars\n% of Net Revenue\n% Change\nDollars\n% of Net Revenue\n% Change\nDollars\n% of Net Revenue\n(in millions, except percentages)\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general, and administrative\n$\n11,952 \n12.5 \n%\n(7)\n%\n$\n12,857 \n14.5 \n%\n(9)\n%\n$\n14,136 \n13.9 \n%\nResearch and development\n3,061 \n3.2 \n%\n9 \n%\n2,801 \n3.2 \n%\n1 \n%\n2,779 \n2.7 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n15,013 \n15.7 \n%\n(4)\n%\n$\n15,658 \n17.7 \n%\n(7)\n%\n$\n16,915 \n16.6 \n%\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\nDollars\n% of Net Revenue\n% Change\nDollars\n% of Net Revenue\n% Change\nDollars\n% of Net Revenue\n(in millions, except percentages)\nNon-GAAP operating expenses\n$\n13,281 \n13.9 \n%\n(4)\n%\n$\n13,766 \n15.6 \n%\n(7)\n%\n$\n14,790 \n14.5 \n%\nFiscal 2025 compared to Fiscal 2024\nDuring Fiscal 2025, total operating expenses decreased 4%, due to a decline in selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses.\n•\nSelling, General, and Administrative\n — During Fiscal 2025, SG&A expenses decreased 7%, driven by a decrease in employee compensation and benefits expense, principally due to a decline in overall headcount.\n•\nResearch and Development\n — \nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses are primarily composed of personnel-related expenses incurred in connection with product development. R&D expenses increased 9% during Fiscal 2025, principally due to an increase in R&D-related employee compensation and benefits expense.\nAs a percentage of net revenue, R&D expenses for both Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were 3.2%. We continue to support R&D initiatives to innovate and introduce new and enhanced solutions into the market.\nDuring Fiscal 2025, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 4%, driven by a decline in employee compensation and benefits expense, primarily resulting from a decline in overall headcount. The decline in employee compensation and benefits expense was partially offset by continued support of R&D initiatives.\nWe continue to make strategic investments designed to enable growth and innovation, while balancing our efforts to drive cost efficiencies in the business. We also expect to continue making investments in support of our own digital transformation, which aims to streamline and optimize our business processes. \nFiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023\nDuring Fiscal 2024, total operating expenses decreased 7% due to a decline in SG&A expenses.\n•\nSelling, General, and Administrative\n — During Fiscal 2024, SG&A expenses decreased 9%, driven by a decrease in employee compensation and benefits expense, principally due to a decline in overall headcount and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in advertising and outside services expense as a result of continued disciplined cost management.\n•\nResearch and Development\n —\n R&D expenses increased 1% during Fiscal 2024 principally due to an increase in R&D-related employee compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in outside services as a result of continued disciplined cost management. \n52\nTable of Contents\nAs a percentage of net revenue, R&D expenses for Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 were 3.2% and 2.7%, respectively. The increases in R&D expenses as a percentage of net revenue were attributable to continued R&D investments as we support R&D initiatives to innovate and introduce new and enhanced solutions into the market.\nDuring Fiscal 2024, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 7% principally due to continued disciplined cost management, which resulted in a decline in employee compensation and benefits, outside services, and advertising expenses, among other items. \nOperating Income\nFiscal 2025 compared to Fiscal 2024\nDuring Fiscal 2025, operating income and non-GAAP operating income increased by 15% to $6.2 billion and 8% to $8.5 billion, respectively. During Fiscal 2025, the increases in operating income and non-GAAP operating income were primarily attributable to an increase in ISG operating income that was driven by our servers and networking offerings and, to a lesser extent, our storage offerings, which was partially offset by a decrease in CSG operating income.\nDuring Fiscal 2025, operating income and non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenue increased 40 basis points to 6.5% and remained flat at 8.9%, respectively. The operating income and non-GAAP operating income rates during the current year were affected by the favorable impact of a decrease in operating expense rate that was driven by strong ISG net revenue growth coupled with continued disciplined cost management. The favorable impact of a decrease in operating expense rate was offset by a decline in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue due to a shift in mix towards AI-optimized server offerings and a competitive CSG pricing environment.\nFiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023\nOperating income and non-GAAP operating income decreased by 6% to $5.4 billion and 9% to $7.9 billion, respectively, during Fiscal 2024. The decreases were driven by a decrease in ISG operating income, which declined primarily as a result of a decrease in net revenue that outpaced the favorable impacts of a decline in input costs and cost management measures. The decline in ISG operating income was primarily attributable to decreases in our servers and networking offerings and, to a lesser extent, our storage offerings. The decline in operating income was partially offset by decreases in other corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles.\nDuring Fiscal 2024, both operating income and non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenue increased 50 basis points, to 6.1% and 8.9%, respectively. The increases were due to an increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue, which was principally driven by a decline in input costs. The increase in operating income and non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenue was offset by an increase in operating expense rate, principally within ISG, that was attributable to a decrease in net revenue which outpaced the impact of continued cost management measures.\n53\nTable of Contents\nInterest and Other, Net\nThe following table presents \ninformation regarding\n interest and other, net for the periods indicated: \nFiscal Year Ended\n \nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\n \n(in millions)\nInterest and other, net:\n \n \nInvestment income, primarily interest\n$\n160 \n$\n305 \n$\n100 \nGain (loss) on investments, net\n177 \n47 \n(206)\nInterest expense\n(1,394)\n(1,501)\n(1,222)\nForeign exchange\n(112)\n(199)\n(265)\nLegal settlement, net\n— \n— \n(894)\nOther\n(20)\n24 \n(59)\nTotal interest and other, net\n$\n(1,189)\n$\n(1,324)\n$\n(2,546)\nFiscal 2025 compared to Fiscal 2024\nDuring Fiscal 2025, the change in interest and other, net was favorable primarily due to gains recognized within our strategic investments portfolio and a reduction in interest expense, partially offset by a decline in interest income on investments.\nFiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023\nThe change in interest and other, net was favorable primarily as a result of $0.9 billion of expense recognized in Fiscal 2023 in connection with an agreement to settle the Class V transaction litigation, coupled with a gain on investments and an increase in investment income during Fiscal 2024. Favorable impacts within interest and other, net were partially offset by an increase in interest expense primarily associated with DFS securitization and structured financing programs. See Note 11 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the settlement of the Class V transaction litigation.\nIncome and Other Taxes\nThe following table presents information regarding our income and other taxes for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions, except percentages)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n5,048 \n$\n4,087 \n$\n3,225 \nIncome tax expense\n$\n472 \n$\n715 \n$\n803 \nEffective income tax rate\n9.4 \n%\n17.5 \n%\n24.9 \n%\nFiscal 2025 compared to Fiscal 2024\nFor Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, our effective income tax rates were 9.4% and 17.5%, respectively. The change in our effective tax rates for Fiscal 2025 as compared to Fiscal 2024 was primarily attributable to discrete tax items. For Fiscal 2025, we recorded discrete tax benefits of $0.4 billion related to changes in uncertain tax benefits resulting from the expiration of certain U.S. statutes of limitations and $0.2 billion related to stock-based compensation. \n54\nTable of Contents\nOur effective income tax rate can fluctuate depending on the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings, as our foreign earnings are generally taxed at lower rates than in the United States. The differences between our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% principally result from the geographical distribution of income, differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items, and discrete tax items. In certain jurisdictions, our tax rate is significantly less than the applicable statutory rate as a result of tax holidays. The majority of our foreign income subject to these tax holidays is attributable to Singapore and China. A significant portion of these income tax benefits relates to a tax holiday that will be effective until January 31, 2029. Most of our other tax holidays will expire in whole or in part during Fiscal 2030 and Fiscal 2031. Many of these tax holidays and reduced tax rates may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met or as a result of changes in tax legislation. As of January 31, 2025, we were not aware of any matters of non-compliance. Our income tax benefits attributable to tax holidays and incentives of the affected subsidiaries were immaterial to our provision for income taxes and earnings per share for Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024.\nMany countries, including Singapore, a country in which we have a tax holiday, have enacted or are in the process of enacting laws based on the Pillar Two proposal relating to a global minimum tax issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). While we expect our effective income tax rate and cash income tax payments may increase in future years as a result of the global minimum tax, the tax did not have a material impact on our Fiscal 2025 consolidated results of operations and we do not expect a material impact for Fiscal 2026. Our assessment could be affected by legislative guidance and future enactment of additional provisions within the Pillar Two framework. \nFor further discussion regarding tax matters, including the status of income tax audits, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. \nFiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023\nFor Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, our effective income tax rates were 17.5% and 24.9%, respectively. The change related to our effective income tax rates for Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023 was primarily attributable to the tax impact of foreign operations and benefits from U.S. research and development tax credits. In addition, our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2023 included the impact of an expense recognized in connection with the agreement to settle the Class V transaction litigation described in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nNet Income \nFiscal 2025 compared to Fiscal 2024\nDuring Fiscal 2025, net income and non-GAAP net income increased 36% to $4.6 billion and 8% to $5.9 billion, respectively. Net income increased primarily due to an increase in operating income and, to a lesser extent, lower income tax expense. Non-GAAP net income increased primarily due to an increase in operating income.\nFiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023\nDuring Fiscal 2024, net income increased 39% to $3.4 billion, driven primarily by a favorable change in interest and other, net, partially offset by a decline in operating income. During Fiscal 2024, non-GAAP net income decreased 5% to $5.4 billion, driven by a decline in operating income, partially offset by a decline in income tax expense.\n55\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Unit Results\nOur reportable segments are based on the ISG and CSG business units. A description of our business units is provided under “Introduction.” See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a reconciliation of net revenue and operating income by reportable segment to consolidated net revenue and consolidated operating income, respectively.\nInfrastructure Solutions Group\nThe following table presents net revenue and operating income attributable to ISG for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\n \nJanuary 31, 2025\n% Change\nFebruary 2, 2024\n% Change\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions, except percentages)\nNet revenue:\nServers and networking\n$\n27,136\n54 \n%\n$\n17,624\n(14)\n%\n$\n20,398\nStorage\n16,457\n1 \n%\n16,261\n(9)\n%\n17,958\nTotal ISG net revenue\n$\n43,593\n29 \n%\n$\n33,885\n(12)\n%\n$\n38,356\nOperating income:\nISG operating income\n$\n5,579\n30 \n%\n$\n4,286\n(15)\n%\n$\n5,045\n% of segment net revenue\n12.8 \n%\n12.6 \n%\n13.2 \n%\nFiscal 2025 compared to Fiscal 2024\nNet Revenue\n \n— \nDuring Fiscal 2025, ISG net revenue increased 29%, driven primarily by strength in our servers and networking offerings. \nNet revenue from sales of servers and networking increased 54% during Fiscal 2025. The increase in servers and networking net revenue was driven by growth in our AI-optimized server offerings and, to a lesser extent, our traditional server and networking offerings. \nStorage net revenue increased 1% during Fiscal 2025 primarily due to an increase in our core storage offerings.\nFrom a geographical perspective, net revenue attributable to ISG increased across all regions during Fiscal 2025, most notably in the Americas.\nOperating Income\n \n— \nDuring Fiscal 2025, ISG operating income as a percentage of net revenue increased 20 basis points to 12.8% due to a decline in operating expense as a percentage of revenue that outpaced the decline in gross margin rate. Operating expense as a percentage of net revenue declined primarily due to strong ISG net revenue growth coupled with continued disciplined cost management. Gross margin rate decreased primarily as the result of a shift in mix towards AI-optimized server offerings.\nFiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023\nNet Revenue\n \n— \nDuring Fiscal 2024, ISG net revenue decreased 12%, driven primarily by servers and networking net revenue and, to a lesser extent, storage net revenue as global macroeconomic conditions continued to impact demand. \nRevenue from sales of servers and networking decreased 14% during Fiscal 2024, driven by a decrease in units sold, the effect of which was partially offset by an increase in the average selling prices of our server offerings. The average selling prices of our server offerings increased as a result of the impact of attached offerings and richer configurations.\nDuring Fiscal 2024, storage net revenue decreased 9%, driven by a decline in net revenue across the majority of our storage offerings. \n56\nTable of Contents\nFrom a geographical perspective, net revenue attributable to ISG decreased in the Americas, EMEA, and APJ during Fiscal 2024.\nOperating Income\n \n— \nDuring Fiscal 2024, ISG operating income as a percentage of net revenue decreased 60 basis points to 12.6% principally due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased as a result of a decline in revenue that outpaced the impact of continued cost management measures coupled with continued investment in research and development. The impact of an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was partially offset by an overall decline in input costs coupled with an increase in average selling prices.\n57\nTable of Contents\nClient Solutions Group\nThe following table presents net revenue and operating income attributable to CSG for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\n% Change\nFebruary 2, 2024\n% Change\nFebruary 3, 2023\n \n(in millions, except percentages)\nNet revenue:\nCommercial\n$\n40,844\n3 \n%\n$\n39,814\n(13)\n%\n$\n45,556\nConsumer\n7,549\n(17)\n%\n9,102\n(28)\n%\n12,657\nTotal CSG net revenue\n$\n48,393\n(1)\n%\n$\n48,916\n(16)\n%\n$\n58,213\nOperating income:\nCSG operating income\n$\n2,972\n(20)\n%\n$\n3,712\n(3)\n%\n$\n3,824\n% of segment net revenue\n6.1 \n%\n7.6 \n%\n6.6 \n%\nFiscal 2025 compared to Fiscal 2024\nNet Revenue\n \n— \nDuring Fiscal 2025, CSG net revenue declined 1% primarily due to a decrease in units sold and, to a lesser extent, a decline in the average selling prices of our offerings.\nCommercial net revenue increased 3% during Fiscal 2025 primarily due to an increase in units sold. Consumer net revenue decreased 17% during Fiscal 2025, primarily as the result of a decline in units sold and, to a lesser extent, a decline in the average selling prices of our consumer offerings. \nFrom a geographical perspective, net revenue attributable to CSG decreased in APJ and the Americas and increased in EMEA during Fiscal 2025.\nOperating Income\n \n—\n During Fiscal 2025, CSG operating income as a percentage of net revenue decreased 150 basis points to 6.1% primarily due to a decline in gross margin rate, which was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decline in gross margin rate was primarily the result of a competitive pricing environment. The decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to continued disciplined cost management.\nFiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023\nNet Revenue\n \n— \nDuring Fiscal 2024, CSG net revenue decreased 16% driven by a decline in units sold as global macroeconomic conditions continued to impact demand.\nCommercial net revenue decreased 13% during Fiscal 2024. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in units sold, which was partially offset by the effect of an increase in the average selling prices of our commercial offerings. Average selling prices of our commercial offerings increased primarily as a result of richer configurations and the mix of offerings sold. Consumer net revenue decreased 28% during Fiscal 2024 principally due to a decrease in units sold and, to a lesser extent, a decline in the average selling prices of our consumer offerings. \nFrom a geographical perspective, net revenue attributable to CSG decreased primarily in APJ and, to a lesser extent, in the Americas and EMEA during Fiscal 2024.\nOperating Income\n \n—\n During Fiscal 2024, CSG operating income as a percentage of net revenue increased 100 basis points to 7.6% primarily due to the impact of an overall decrease in input costs coupled with an increase in the average selling prices of our commercial offerings, as described above. The impact of these factors was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, which increased as a result of a decline in CSG net revenue that outpaced the impact of continued cost management measures.\n58\nTable of Contents\nOTHER BALANCE SHEET ITEMS\nAccounts Receivable \nWe sell products and services directly to customers and through a variety of sales channels, including retail distribution. Our accounts receivable, net was $10.3 billion and $9.3 billion as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, respectively. Accounts receivable, net was up due to growth in our AI-optimized server offerings and the timing of cash receipts. We maintain an allowance for expected credit losses to cover receivables that may be deemed uncollectible. The allowance for expected credit losses is an estimate based on an analysis of historical loss experience, current receivables aging, and management’s assessment of current conditions and its reasonable and supportable expectation of future conditions, as well as specific identifiable customer accounts that are deemed at risk. As of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, the allowance for expected credit losses was $63 million and $71 million, respectively. Based on our assessment, we believe that we are adequately reserved for expected credit losses. \nDell Financial Services and Financing Receivables\nWe offer or arrange a portfolio of payment and consumption solutions and services for our customers globally, including as-a-Service, subscription, utility, leases, and loans designed to match customers' consumption and financing preferences. We believe these options provide operational and financial flexibility and strengthen our customer relationships. To support financing solutions and services as part of the portfolio, DFS originates, collects, and services customer receivables primarily related to the purchase of our product and services solutions. New financing originations were $8.4 billion for both Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 and $9.7 billion for Fiscal 2023.\nOur leases are generally classified as sales-type leases or operating leases. On commencement of sales-type leases, we recognize profit up-front, and recognize amounts due from the customer under the lease contract as financing receivables. Interest income is recognized as net product revenue over the term of the lease. Upon origination of operating leases, we record equipment under operating leases, classified as property, plant, and equipment, net. We recognize product revenue and depreciation expense, classified as cost of net revenue, over the contract term.\nAs of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, our financing receivables, net were $11.2 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively\n. \nWe maintain an allowance to cover expected financing receivables credit losses and evaluate credit loss expectations based on our total portfolio. The principal charge-off rate for our financing receivables portfolio was 0.6% for Fiscal 2025 and 0.5% for both Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023. The credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong due to the mix of high-quality commercial accounts in our portfolio. We continue to monitor broader economic indicators and their potential impact on future credit loss performance. We have an extensive process to manage our exposure to customer credit risk that includes active management of credit lines and collection activities. We also sell selected fixed-term financing receivables without recourse to unrelated third parties on a periodic basis, primarily to manage certain concentrations of customer credit exposure. Based on our assessment of the customer financing receivables, we believe that we are adequately reserved.\nWe retain a residual interest in equipment leased under our lease programs. As of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, the residual interest recorded as part of financing receivables was $168 million and $157 million, respectively. The amount of the residual interest is established at the inception of the lease based upon estimates of the value of the equipment at the end of the lease term using historical studies, industry data, and future value-at-risk demand valuation methods. On a quarterly basis, we assess the carrying amount of our recorded residual values for expected losses. Generally, expected losses as a result of residual value risk on equipment under lease are not considered to be significant primarily because of the existence of a secondary market with respect to the equipment. Further, the lease agreement defines applicable return conditions and remedies for non-compliance to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return. No expected losses were recorded related to residual assets during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024.\nAs of both January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, equipment under operating leases, net was $2.2 billion. We assess the carrying amount of the equipment under operating leases for impairment whenever events or circumstances may indicate that an impairment has occurred. No material impairment losses were recorded related to such equipment during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023.\n59\nTable of Contents\nDFS offerings are initially funded through cash on hand at the time of origination, most of which is subsequently replaced with asset-backed financing. For offerings that qualify as sales-type leases, the initial funding of financing receivables is reflected as an impact to cash flows from operations and is largely subsequently offset by cash proceeds from financing. For offerings that qualify as operating leases, the initial funding is classified as a capital expenditure and reflected as an impact to cash flows used in investing activities.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information about our financing receivables and the associated allowances, and equipment under operating leases.\n60\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY, CASH REQUIREMENTS, AND MARKET CONDITIONS\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe rely on operating cash flows, which are impacted by trends in the demand environment, as our primary source of liquidity for our ongoing business operations. We monitor the efficiency of our balance sheet to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to support our business and strategic initiatives. \nIn addition to internally generated cash, we have access to other capital sources to finance our strategic initiatives and fund growth in our financing operations. Our strategy is to deploy capital from any potential source, whether internally generated cash or debt, depending on the adequacy and availability of that source of capital and whether it can be accessed in a cost-effective manner. \nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, together with cash that will be provided by future operations and borrowings and issuances expected to be available under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, will be sufficient over the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter to meet our material cash requirements, including funding of our operations, debt-related payments, capital expenditures, and other corporate needs. \nAs part of our overall capital allocation strategy, we intend to return capital to our stockholders through both share repurchase programs and dividend payments and use the remaining available cash to drive growth and maintain our investment grade credit rating. \nThe following table presents our cash and cash equivalents as well as our available borrowings as of the dates indicated: \nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\n(in millions)\nCash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n3,633 \n$\n7,366 \nRemaining available borrowings under the revolving credit facility\n5,999 \n5,999 \nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings\n$\n9,632 \n$\n13,365 \nDuring Fiscal 2025, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $3.7 billion primarily due to the return of capital to our stockholders, capital expenditures, net repayment of DFS debt and Senior Notes, and payments to settle employee tax withholdings on stock-based compensation, the effects of which were partially offset by cash flows from operations.\nAs of January 31, 2025, our revolving credit facility had a maximum capacity of $6.0 billion. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by draws on the facility and outstanding letters of credit. As of January 31, 2025, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility and remaining available borrowings totaled approximately $6.0 billion. The revolving credit facility also acts as a backstop to provide liquidity support for our commercial paper program.\nWe maintain a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured notes in a maximum aggregate face amount of $5.0 billion outstanding at any time, with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. As of January 31, 2025, we had no outstanding issuances under the program. \nWe may regularly use our available borrowings from the revolving credit facility and issuances under the commercial paper program, generally on a short-term basis, for general corporate purposes. See the following discussion for additional information about our debt.\n \n61\nTable of Contents\nDebt\nThe following table presents our outstanding debt as of the dates indicated:\nJanuary 31, 2025\nChange\nFebruary 2, 2024\n(in millions)\nCore debt\nSenior Notes\n$\n15,073 \n$\n(534)\n$\n15,607 \nLegacy Notes\n952 \n— \n952 \nDFS allocated debt\n(3,028)\n(1,388)\n(1,640)\nTotal core debt \n12,997 \n(1,922)\n14,919 \nDFS related debt\nDFS debt\n8,711 \n(781)\n9,492 \nDFS allocated debt\n3,028 \n1,388 \n1,640 \nTotal DFS related debt\n11,739 \n607 \n11,132 \nOther\n52 \n(119)\n171 \nTotal debt, principal amount\n24,788 \n(1,434)\n26,222 \nCarrying value adjustments\n(221)\n7 \n(228)\nTotal debt, carrying value\n$\n24,567 \n$\n(1,427)\n$\n25,994 \nThe outstanding principal amount of our debt decreased $1.4 billion to $24.8 billion as of January 31, 2025, driven primarily by net repayments of our DFS debt and Senior Notes.\nWe define core debt as the total principal amount of our debt, less DFS related debt and other debt. Our core debt was $13.0 billion and $14.9 billion as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, respectively. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information about our debt.\nDFS related debt primarily represents debt from our securitization and structured financing programs. Our risk of loss under these programs is limited to transferred lease and loan payments and associated equipment, as the credit holders have no recourse to Dell Technologies.\nTo fund the expansion of our DFS business, we balance the use of the securitization and structured financing programs with other sources of liquidity. We approximate the amount of our core debt used to fund the DFS business by applying a 7:1 debt-to-equity ratio to the sum of our financing receivables balance and equipment under operating leases, net, also referred to as DFS owned assets. The debt-to-equity ratio is based on the underlying credit quality of the assets. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information about our DFS debt.\nThe following table presents DFS owned assets as of the dates indicated:\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\n(in millions)\nFinancing receivables, net\n$\n11,231 \n$\n10,520 \nEquipment under operating leases, net\n2,185 \n2,202 \nDFS owned assets\n$\n13,416 \n$\n12,722 \nWe believe we will continue to be able to make our debt principal and interest payments, including payment of short-term maturities, from existing and expected sources of cash, primarily from operating cash flows. Cash used for debt principal and interest payments may include short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program, our revolving credit facility, or other borrowings. Under our variable-rate debt, we could experience variations in our future interest expense from potential fluctuations in applicable reference rates, or from possible fluctuations in the level of DFS debt required to meet future demand for customer financing. \n62\nTable of Contents\nAt our sole discretion, we may purchase, redeem, prepay, refinance, or otherwise retire any amount of our outstanding indebtedness under the terms of such indebtedness at any time and from time to time, in open market or negotiated transactions with the holders of such indebtedness or otherwise, as we consider appropriate in light of market conditions and other relevant factors.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents a summary of our \nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\n \nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions)\nNet change in cash from:\nOperating activities\n$\n4,521 \n$\n8,676 \n$\n3,565 \nInvesting activities\n(2,215)\n(2,783)\n(3,024)\nFinancing activities\n(5,815)\n(7,094)\n(1,625)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n(179)\n(186)\n(104)\nChange in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n(3,688)\n$\n(1,387)\n$\n(1,188)\nOperating Activities\n — Cash provided by operating activities was $4.5 billion during Fiscal 2025 and was driven by profitability, partially offset by working capital dynamics. Working capital was primarily impacted by AI, which led to higher inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable levels. During Fiscal 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $8.7 billion, which was primarily driven by profitability coupled with strong inventory management and cash collections performance. Cash provided by operating activities during Fiscal 2024 also reflected the impact of the $0.9 billion net payment to settle the Class V transaction litigation and $0.4 billion in proceeds from the sale of our U.S. consumer revolving customer receivables portfolio.\nInvesting Activities\n —\n Investing activities primarily consist of cash used to fund capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment inclusive of equipment under operating leases and equipment used to support our as-a-Service offerings, which we refer to collectively as assets in a customer contract. Additional activities may include capitalized software development costs, the maturities, sales, and purchases of investments, and acquisitions and divestitures. Cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively, and was primarily applied to capital expenditures. \n \nFinancing Activities\n — Financing activities primarily consist of the proceeds and repayments of debt and return of capital to our stockholders. Cash used in financing activities was $5.8 billion during Fiscal 2025 and primarily consisted of repurchases of common stock, inclusive of payments to settle employee tax withholdings on stock-based compensation, net repayments of our DFS debt and Senior Notes, and the payment of quarterly dividends. During Fiscal 2024, cash used in financing activities was $7.1 billion and primarily consisted of principal repayments of our Senior Notes, repurchases of common stock, inclusive of payments to settle employee tax withholdings on stock-based compensation, and the payment of quarterly dividends.\nDFS Cash Flow Impacts\n \n— DFS offerings are initially funded through cash on hand at the time of origination, most of which is subsequently replaced with asset-backed financing. For offerings that qualify as sales-type leases, the initial funding of financing receivables is reflected as an impact to cash flows from operations and is largely subsequently offset by cash proceeds from financing. For offerings that qualify as operating leases, the initial funding is classified as a capital expenditure and reflected as cash flows used in investing activities. DFS new financing originations were $8.4 billion during both Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 and $9.7 billion during Fiscal 2023. As of January 31, 2025, we had $11.2 billion of total net financing receivables and $2.2 billion of equipment under operating leases, net.\n63\nTable of Contents\nSupply Chain Finance Program\n \n— We maintain a Supply Chain Finance Program (the “SCF Program”) that enables eligible suppliers to sell receivables due from us to a third-party financial institution at the suppliers’ sole discretion. The SCF Program does not impact our liquidity, as payments by us to participating suppliers are remitted to the financial institution on the original invoice due date. Further, we negotiate payment terms with our suppliers regardless of their decision to participate in the SCF Program. Payments made under the SCF Program are included in cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information regarding the SCF Program.\nMaterial Capital Commitments and Cash Requirements\nThe Company’s material capital commitments include the following:\nCapital Expenditures\n \n— We spent $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively, on property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software development costs. Of total expenditures incurred, funding of assets in a customer contract totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively. Product demand, product mix, the use of contract manufacturers, and ongoing investments in operating and information technology infrastructure influence the level and prioritization of our capital expenditures.\nRepurchases of Common Stock\n \n— On September 23, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program with no fixed expiration date under which we may repurchase up to $5 billion of shares of Class C Common Stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases. On October 5, 2023 and February 27, 2025, subsequent to the close of Fiscal 2025, our Board of Directors authorized additional shares for repurchase under the stock repurchase program of $5 billion and $10 billion, respectively. Following the February 27, 2025 approval, we had approximately $11.5 billion of authorized shares remaining under the program.\nDuring Fiscal 2025, we repurchased approximately 22 million shares of Class C Common Stock for a total purchase price of approximately $2.6 billion. During Fiscal 2024, we repurchased approximately 34 million shares of Class C Common Stock for a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion.\nDividend Payments\n \n— During Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, the Company paid $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in dividends and dividend equivalents at a rate of $0.445 and $0.37 per share per fiscal quarter, respectively. \nOn February 27, 2025, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an 18% increase in the dividend rate to $0.525 per share per fiscal quarter beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2026.\nAdditionally, the Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\nDebt\n — Our expected principal cash payments on borrowings are exclusive of discounts and premiums. As of January 31, 2025, the Company had outstanding debt for an aggregate principal amount of $24.8 billion, with $5.2 billion payable within 12 months. Included within the aggregate principal amount was $16.1 billion of corporate and other debt with varying maturities, with an immaterial amount payable within 12 months, and $8.7 billion of DFS debt, with $5.2 billion payable within 12 months. \nAs of January 31, 2025, future interest payments associated with outstanding debt were $7.4 billion, with $1.2 billion payable within 12 months. Included within total future interest payments is $6.9 billion of payments related to corporate and other debt, with $0.9 billion payable within 12 months, and $0.5 billion of payments related to DFS debt, with $0.3 billion payable within 12 months.\nPurchase Obligations\n \n—\n Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us. These obligations specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be canceled without penalty.\n64\nTable of Contents\nWe utilize several suppliers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our products. Our efficient supply chain management allows us to enter into flexible and mutually beneficial purchase arrangements with our suppliers in order to minimize inventory risk. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire raw materials or other goods and services, including product components, by issuing to suppliers authorizations to purchase based on our projected demand and manufacturing needs. Additionally, to meet the growing demand and increasing complexity of our AI-optimized offerings, we have increased our purchases of certain components with suppliers, which has resulted in increased purchase obligations. These purchase orders are typically fulfilled within 30 days and are entered into during the ordinary course of business in order to establish best pricing and continuity of supply for our production. Purchase orders are not included in purchase obligations, as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding purchase obligations.\nAs of January 31, 2025, the Company had purchase obligations of $6.5 billion, of which $5.0 billion was payable within 12 months.\nOperating Leases\n — We lease property and equipment, manufacturing facilities, and office space under non-cancelable leases. Certain of these leases obligate us to pay taxes, maintenance, and repair costs. As of January 31, 2025, the Company had operating lease obligations of $0.8 billion, with $0.2 billion payable within 12 months. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information about our leasing transactions in which we are the lessee.\nTax Obligations\n — Tax obligations represent a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As of January 31, 2025, the balance of tax obligations was $60 million, with the full amount payable within 12 months. Excluded from the amounts above are $0.9 billion in additional liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as of January 31, 2025. We are unable to reliably estimate the expected payment dates for any liabilities for uncertain tax positions. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information regarding these tax matters.\nMarket Conditions\nWe regularly monitor economic conditions and associated impacts on the financial markets and our business. We consistently evaluate the financial health of our supplier base, carefully manage customer credit, diversify counterparty risk, and monitor the concentration risk of our cash and cash equivalents balances globally. We routinely monitor our financial exposure to borrowers and counterparties.\nWe monitor credit risk associated with our financial counterparties using various market credit risk indicators such as credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies and changes in market credit default swap levels. Our AI solutions to date have been purchased primarily by a small number of larger customers and cloud service providers. Such purchases generally involve larger amounts of credit, and could impact overall credit risk in trade and financing receivables. We perform periodic evaluations of our positions with counterparties and may limit exposure to any one counterparty in accordance with our policies. We monitor and manage our positions based on current and expected market developments. \nWe use derivative instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures. We use forward contracts and purchased options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we primarily use forward contracts and may use purchased options to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information about our use of derivative instruments.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our variable-rate debt portfolio. In the normal course of business we follow established policies and procedures to manage this risk, including monitoring of our asset and liability mix and the use of derivative instruments. As a result, we do not anticipate any material losses from interest rate risk.\n65\nTable of Contents\nSummarized Guarantor Financial Information\nThe Company’s outstanding senior notes (“Senior Notes”) are registered, unsecured, and issued by Dell International L.L.C. and EMC Corporation (the “Issuers”), both of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Dell Technologies Inc. The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a joint and several unsecured basis by Dell Technologies Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Denali Intermediate, Inc. and Dell Inc. (collectively, the “Guarantors”). \nBasis of Preparation of the Summarized Financial Information\n — The tables below are summarized financial information provided in conformity with Rule 13-01 of the SEC’s Regulation S-X. The summarized financial information of the Issuers and Guarantors (collectively, the “Obligor Group”) is presented on a combined basis, excluding intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the Obligor Group. The Obligor Group’s investment balances in Non-Obligor Subsidiaries have been excluded. The Obligor Group’s amounts due from, amounts due to, and transactions with Non-Obligor Subsidiaries have been presented separately. \nThe following table presents summarized results of operations information for the Obligor Group for the period indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\n(in millions)\nNet revenue\n$\n8,507 \nGross margin\n4,328 \nOperating income\n908 \nInterest and other, net\n(4,021)\nLoss before income taxes\n$\n(3,113)\nNet loss attributable to Obligor Group (a)\n$\n(2,167)\n____________________\n(a)\nIncludes net loss from intercompany transactions with Non-Obligor Subsidiaries of $4,268 million, which primarily consists of interest expense, shared services, and the resale of solutions.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents summarized balance sheet information for the Obligor Group as of the dates indicated:\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\n(in millions)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\n$\n3,132 \n$\n2,631 \nIntercompany receivables\n175 \n281 \nShort-term intercompany loan receivables\n— \n92 \nTotal current assets\n3,307 \n3,004 \nGoodwill and intangible assets\n14,073 \n14,447 \nOther non-current assets\n3,412 \n3,437 \nTotal assets\n$\n20,792 \n$\n20,888 \nLIABILITIES\nCurrent liabilities\n$\n4,097 \n$\n5,255 \nLong-term debt\n15,824 \n15,353 \nLong-term intercompany loan payables\n44,516 \n41,617 \nOther non-current liabilities\n3,339 \n3,473 \nTotal liabilities\n$\n67,776 \n$\n65,698 \n67\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires certain estimates, assumptions, and judgments to be made that may affect our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounting policies that have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical. We consider an accounting policy to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption is subject to a material level of judgment and if changes in those estimates or assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\n — We sell a wide portfolio of products and services offerings to our customers. Our agreements have varying terms and conditions depending on the goods and services being sold, the rights and obligations conveyed, and the legal jurisdiction of the arrangement. While most of our agreements have standard terms and conditions, more complex agreements may contain nonstandard terms and conditions. There are significant judgments in interpreting agreements to determine the appropriate accounting for nonstandard terms and conditions.\nOur contracts with customers often include multiple performance obligations for various distinct goods and services such as hardware, software licenses, support and maintenance agreements, and other service offerings and solutions. We use significant judgment to assess whether these promises are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately. In certain hardware solutions, the hardware is highly interdependent on, and interrelated with, the embedded software. In these offerings, the hardware and software licenses are accounted for as a single performance obligation.\nThe transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount to which we expect to be entitled using either the expected value or most likely amount method. Estimates are updated each reporting period as the variability is resolved or if additional information becomes available. Generally, volume discounts, rebates, and sales returns reduce the transaction price. When we determine the transaction price, we only include amounts that are not subject to significant future reversal.\nWhen a contract includes multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in proportion to the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of each performance obligation. \nJudgment is required when determining the SSP of our performance obligations. If the observable price is available, we utilize that price for the SSP. If the observable price is not available, the SSP must be estimated. We estimate SSP by considering multiple factors, including, but not limited to, pricing practices, internal costs, and profit objectives as well as overall market conditions, which include geographic or regional specific factors, competitive positioning, and competitor actions. Our SSP estimates rely, in part, on company pricing trends. Market conditions could impact the selling price in the current period which may not be reflective of trends, and could lead to revenue timing, classification, and segment differences when compared to similar contracts in other periods. SSP for our performance obligations is periodically reassessed.\nFor transactions that involve a third party, the Company evaluates whether it is acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction. This determination requires significant judgment and impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized. If the Company determines that it controls a good or service before it is transferred to the customer, the Company is acting as the principal and recognizes revenue at the gross amount of consideration it is entitled to from the customer. Indicators that the Company controls a good or service before transferring to a customer include, but are not limited to, the Company being the primary obligor to the customer, establishing its own pricing, and having inventory and credit risks.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments \n— Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances may indicate that an impairment has occurred.\nTo determine whether goodwill is impaired, we first assess certain qualitative factors. Qualitative factors that may be assessed include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, or other relevant company-specific events. Based on this assessment, if it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of a goodwill reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. \n68\nTable of Contents\nSignificant judgment is exercised in the identification of goodwill reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to goodwill reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit. The fair value of each of our goodwill reporting units is generally estimated using a combination of public company multiples and discounted cash flow methodologies, which is then compared to the carrying value of each goodwill reporting unit. The discounted cash flow and public company multiples methodologies require significant judgment, including estimation of future revenues, gross margins, and operating expenses, which are dependent on internal forecasts, current and anticipated economic conditions and trends, selection of market multiples through assessment of the reporting unit’s performance relative to peer competitors, the estimation of the long-term revenue growth rate and discount rate of our business, and the determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the goodwill reporting unit, potentially resulting in a non-cash impairment charge. \nThe fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is generally estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. The discounted cash flow methodologies require significant judgment, including estimation of future revenue, the estimation of the long-term revenue growth rate of our business, and the determination of the weighted average cost of capital and royalty rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, potentially resulting in a non-cash impairment charge.\nFor our annual impairment test during the third fiscal quarter of Fiscal 2025, during which the Company elected to quantitatively test the Infrastructure Solutions Group and Client Solutions Group reporting units, we determined that the fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying amount. For more information about our goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nIncome Taxes \n— We are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes. We calculate a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. We account for the tax impact of including Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) in U.S. taxable income as a period cost. We provide related valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, where appropriate. Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.\nSignificant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our tax return positions are sustainable, we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits and a consideration of the relevant taxing authority’s administrative practices and precedents. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. We believe we have provided adequate reserves for all uncertain tax positions.\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n— The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Significant judgment is required in determining whether a loss should be accrued, and changes in these factors could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n69\nTable of Contents\nInventories \n— We state our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We record a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. We perform a detailed review of inventory each fiscal\n \nquarter that considers multiple factors, including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, product pricing, and component cost trends. The industries in which we compete are subject to demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for our products are less favorable than\n \nforecasted, or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, we may be required to record additional write-downs, which would adversely affect our gross margin.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n70\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7A — QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nDell Technologies is exposed to a variety of market risks, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate changes affecting its variable-rate debt, and changes in the market value of equity investments. In the normal course of business, Dell Technologies employs established policies and procedures to manage these risks.\nForeign Currency Risk\nDuring Fiscal 2025, the principal foreign currencies in which Dell Technologies transacted business were the Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, and Australian Dollar. The objective of Dell Technologies in managing its exposures to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes on earnings and cash flows. Accordingly, Dell Technologies utilizes foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge its exposure on forecasted transactions and firm commitments for certain currencies. Dell Technologies monitors its foreign currency exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. However, there can be no assurance that the foreign currency hedging activities will continue to substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on Dell Technologies’ results of operations and financial position in the future.\nBased on the outstanding foreign currency hedge instruments of Dell Technologies, which include designated and non-designated instruments, there was a maximum potential one-day loss in fair value at\n a 95% confidence level of approximately $9 million\n \nas of \nJanuary 31, 2025 and $15 million as of February 2, 2024, using a Value-at-Risk (“VAR”) model. By using market implied rates and incorporating volatility and correlation among the currencies of a portfolio, the VAR model simulates 10,000 randomly generated market prices and calculates the difference between the fifth percentile and the average as the Value-at-Risk. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool and is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred. Additionally, as Dell Technologies utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging forecasted and firmly committed transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure.\nInterest Rate Risk\nDell Technologies is primarily exposed to interest rate risk related to its variable-rate debt portfolio and fixed-rate debt which has been converted to variable-rate debt through the use of derivative instruments. As of January 31, 2025, interest rate risk exposure is related to DFS borrowings.\nDFS debt represents borrowings under securitization programs and structured financing programs that facilitate the funding of leases, loans, and other alternative payment structures. Amounts outstanding under these facilities generally bear interest at variable rates equal to applicable margins plus specified base rates. Interest expense on such borrowings is recognized within interest and other, net whereas interest income on the underlying assets is recognized to net revenue over time. The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows related to the interest rate payments on such borrowings. These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and mark-to-market adjustments are recognized immediately within interest and other, net. \nDell Technologies’ interest rate risk exposure is limited to fluctuations in interest rates on unhedged borrowings where we do not mitigate the interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps. \nAs of January 31, 2025, borrowings exposed to interest rate fluctuations were $2.6 billion relative to total borrowings of $24.6 billion, and accrued interest at an annual rate between 3.65% and 6.53%. Based on this debt outstanding as of January 31, 2025, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $26 million in annual interest expense.\nBy comparison, as of February 2, 2024, borrowings exposed to interest rate fluctuations were $3.3 billion, relative to total borrowings of $26.0 billion, and accrued interest at an annual rate between 2.45% and 6.88%. Based on this debt outstanding as of February 2, 2024, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $33 million in annual interest expense. \nFor more information about our debt and use of derivative instruments, see Note 5, Note 7, and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\n71\nTable of Contents\nEquity Price Risk\nStrategic Investments\n — Our strategic investments include primarily early-stage, privately-held companies that are considered to be in the start-up or development stages and are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in the companies. We record these investments at cost, less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes. The evaluation is based on information provided by these companies, which are not subject to the same disclosure obligations as U.S. publicly-traded companies, and, accordingly, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data provided. As of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, we held strategic investments in non-marketable securities of $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information.\n72\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8 \n—\n FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nIndex\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ID: \n238\n)\n74\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024\n76\nConsolidated Statements of Income for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023\n77\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the \nfiscal year\ns ended \nJanuary 3\n1, 202\n5\n, February 2, 20\n24, and Febr\nuary 3, 2023\n78\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the \nfiscal year\ns ended \nJanuary 31,2025, February 2, 2024\n, and February 3,\n2023\n79\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) for the \nfiscal year\ns ended \nJanuary 31\n, 202\n5\n, February 2\n, 2024\n, and\n \nFebruary\n 3, 2023\n80\nNotes to the\n Consolidated Financial Statements\n83\nNote 1 — Overview and Basis of Presentation\n83\nNote 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n86\nNote \n3\n — Fair Value Measurements\n96\nNote \n4\n — Investments\n98\nNote \n5\n — Financial Services\n100\nNote \n6\n — Leases\n107\nNote \n7\n — Debt\n109\nNote \n8\n — Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n111\nNote \n9\n — Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n115\nNote \n10\n — Deferred Revenue\n117\nNote 1\n1\n — Commitments and Contingencies\n118\nNote 1\n2\n — Income and Other Taxes\n121\nNote 1\n3\n — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n126\nNote 1\n4\n — Capitalization\n128\nNote 1\n5\n — Earnings Per Share\n130\nNote 1\n6\n — Stock-Based Compensation\n131\nNote 1\n7\n — Retirement Plan Benefits\n134\nNote 1\n8\n — Segment Information\n136\nNote 1\n9\n — Related Party Transactions\n140\nNote \n20\n — Supplemental Consolidated Financial Information\n142\nNote 2\n1\n — Government Assistance\n145\nNote 22 — Quarterly Results (Unaudited)\n146\nNote \n2\n3\n — Subsequent Events\n150\n73\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Dell Technologies Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Dell Technologies Inc.\n \nand its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 31, 2025\n \nand February 2, 2024,\n \nand the related consolidated\n \nstatements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity (deficit) and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).\n \nWe also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2025\n \nand February 2, 2024, and the results of its\n \noperations and its\n \ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the COSO because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date as the Company did not design and maintain effective controls over non-recurring credits from certain suppliers that related to cost of net revenue.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness referred to above is described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2025 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management’s report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n74\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition — Identification of Performance Obligations in Revenue Contracts\nAs described in Notes 2 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s contracts with customers often include the promise to transfer multiple goods and services to a customer. Distinct promises within a contract are referred to as performance obligations and are accounted for as separate units of account. Management assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such goods or services are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. The Company’s performance obligations include various distinct goods and services such as hardware, software licenses, support and maintenance agreements, and other service offerings and solutions. For the year ended January 31, 2025, a significant portion of the $43.6 billion Infrastructure Solutions Group (“ISG”) reportable segment net revenues relate to contracts with multiple performance obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the identification of performance obligations in revenue contracts is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in identifying performance obligations in revenue contracts and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to whether performance obligations in revenue contracts were appropriately identified by management.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls related to the proper identification of performance obligations in revenue contracts. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s identification of performance obligations by examining revenue contracts on a test basis.\n/s/

The Company initiated an investigation that indicated that the credits resulted from the actions of certain procurement employees that support a limited number of suppliers, which affected the Client Solutions Group (“CSG”) segment. The revision did not have an impact on the Company’s net revenue.\nThe Company determined that the impacts were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to its previously issued Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for any of the prior quarters or the annual period in which they occurred. However, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Company concluded that correcting the cumulative misstatement in the current period would be material to its results of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. \nAccordingly, the Company has revised its previously issued Consolidated Financial Statements, as applicable, as of and for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024.\n \nA summary of the corrections to the impacted financial statement line items in these Consolidated Financial Statements is presented below.\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position\nFebruary 2, 2024\nAs Reported\nAdjustment\nAs Revised\n(in millions)\nCurrent assets:\nOther current assets\n$\n10,973\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n11,010\n \nTotal current assets\n$\n35,947\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n35,984\n \nTotal assets\n$\n82,089\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n82,126\n \nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n19,389\n \n$\n(\n163\n)\n$\n19,226\n \nAccrued and other\n$\n6,805\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n6,828\n \nTotal current liabilities\n$\n48,494\n \n$\n(\n140\n)\n$\n48,354\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n84,398\n \n$\n(\n140\n)\n$\n84,258\n \nStockholders' equity (deficit):\nAccumulated deficit\n$\n(\n4,630\n)\n$\n177\n \n$\n(\n4,453\n)\nTotal Dell Technologies Inc. stockholders' equity (deficit)\n$\n(\n2,404\n)\n$\n177\n \n$\n(\n2,227\n)\nTotal stockholders' equity (deficit)\n$\n(\n2,309\n)\n$\n177\n \n$\n(\n2,132\n)\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n$\n82,089\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n82,126\n \n83\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nFiscal Year Ended\nFebruary 2, 2024\nAs Reported\nAdjustment\nAs Revised\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nCost of net revenue:\nProducts\n$\n53,316\n \n$\n(\n200\n)\n$\n53,116\n \nTotal cost of net revenue\n$\n67,556\n \n$\n(\n200\n)\n$\n67,356\n \nGross margin\n$\n20,869\n \n$\n200\n \n$\n21,069\n \nOperating income\n$\n5,211\n \n$\n200\n \n$\n5,411\n \nIncome before income taxes\n$\n3,887\n \n$\n200\n \n$\n4,087\n \nIncome tax expense\n$\n692\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n715\n \nNet income\n$\n3,195\n \n$\n177\n \n$\n3,372\n \nNet income attributable to Dell Technologies Inc.\n$\n3,211\n \n$\n177\n \n$\n3,388\n \nEarnings per share attributable to Dell Technologies Inc.\nBasic\n$\n4.46\n \n$\n0.25\n \n$\n4.71\n \nDiluted\n$\n4.36\n \n$\n0.24\n \n$\n4.60\n \nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nFiscal Year Ended\nFebruary 2, 2024\nAs Reported\nAdjustment\nAs Revised\n(in millions)\nNet income\n$\n3,195\n \n$\n177\n \n$\n3,372\n \nComprehensive income, net of tax\n$\n3,396\n \n$\n177\n \n$\n3,573\n \nComprehensive income attributable to Dell Technologies Inc.\n$\n3,412\n \n$\n177\n \n$\n3,589\n \nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nFiscal Year Ended\nFebruary 2, 2024\nAs Reported\nAdjustment\nAs Revised\n(in millions)\nCash flow from operations:\nNet income\n$\n3,195\n \n$\n177\n \n$\n3,372\n \nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nOther assets and liabilities\n$\n(\n1,470\n)\n$\n(\n14\n)\n$\n(\n1,484\n)\nAccounts payable\n$\n(\n335\n)\n$\n(\n163\n)\n$\n(\n498\n)\nThe Company will also revise previously reported quarterly financial information for this misstatement based on the summary presented herein in its future filings with the SEC, as applicable. A summary of the corrections to the impacted financial statement line items to the Company’s previously issued Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for each quarterly period is presented in Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n84\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nSecureworks \n— As of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, the Company held approximately \n78.6\n%\n and \n81.0\n%, respectively, of the outstanding equity interest in Secureworks Corp. (“Secureworks”). The portion of the results of operations of Secureworks allocable to its other owners is shown as net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income, as an adjustment to net income attributable to Dell Technologies stockholders. The non-controlling interests’ share of equity in Secureworks is reflected as non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and wa\ns $\n95\n million\n as of both January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024.\nOn October 21, 2024, Secureworks announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement providing for its sale to Sophos Inc., an affiliate of Thoma Bravo, L.P., a private equity and growth capital firm. The transaction was completed on February 3, 2025, subsequent to the close of the Company’s fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $\n0.9\n billion. The Company expects to record an immaterial gain from the transaction. \nIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company concluded that Secureworks’ assets and liabilities have met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale as of January 31, 2025. The Company reclassified the related assets and liabilities as current assets held for sale and current liabilities held for sale, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of January 31, 2025. \nThe following table presents the major classes of assets and liabilities as of January 31, 2025 related to Secureworks, which were classified as held for sale as of the date indicated:\nJanuary 31, 2025\n(in millions)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n62\n \nAccounts receivable, net\n51\n \nOther current assets\n11\n \nTotal current assets\n124\n \nGoodwill\n427\n \nIntangible assets, net\n63\n \nOther non-current assets\n54\n \nTotal assets\n$\n668\n \nLIABILITIES\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccrued and other\n$\n71\n \nShort-term deferred revenue\n125\n \nTotal current liabilities\n196\n \nOther non-current liabilities\n25\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n221\n \nThe sale of Secureworks does not meet the criteria for discontinued operations reporting, and as a result its operating results and cash flows are not separately stated as a discontinued operation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. As Secureworks does not meet the requirements for a reportable segment, its operating results are included within Corporate and other.\nOther Events\n — On October 4, 2023, the Company established a new consumer revolving financing program with Comenity Capital Bank, a subsidiary of Bread Financial Holdings, Inc. (“Bread”), under which transactions are originated, owned, serviced, and collected by Bread. Under the agreement, the Company also sold its U.S. consumer revolving customer receivables portfolio for total cash consideration of approximately $\n390\n million, resulting in an immaterial gain recognized within the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company has no continuing involvement with these receivables, which are serviced by Bread.\n85\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 2 — \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \nPrinciples of Consolidation \n— These Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Dell Technologies and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as the accounts of Secureworks, which, as indicated in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, was majority-owned by Dell Technologies as of January 31, 2025. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nThe Company also consolidates Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\") where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the applicable entities’ operations. For each VIE, the primary beneficiary is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to such VIE. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of each entity, the Company evaluates its power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE by considering the purpose and design of each entity and the risks each entity was designed to create and pass through to its respective variable interest holders. The Company also evaluates its economic interests in each of the VIEs. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding consolidated VIEs.\nUse of Estimates \n— The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n— All highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at date of purchase are reported at fair value and are considered to be cash equivalents. Credit card receivables are classified as either cash and cash equivalents or receivables depending on the nature of the payment terms.\n \nInvestments \n— The Company has strategic investments in equity and other securities as well as investments in fixed-income debt securities. All equity and other securities and long-term fixed income debt securities are recorded as long-term investments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Short-term fixed income debt securities are recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nStrategic investments in marketable equity and other securities are recorded at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets. Strategic investments in non-marketable equity and other securities without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost, less impairment, and are adjusted for observable price changes. In evaluating equity investments without readily determinable fair values for impairment or observable price changes, the Company uses inputs that include pre- and post-money valuations of recent financing events and the impact of those events on its fully diluted ownership percentages, as well as other available information regarding the issuer’s historical and forecasted performance. Fair value measurements and impairments for strategic investments are recognized in interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \nFixed-income debt securities are carried at amortized cost and approximate fair value. The Company intends to hold its fixed-income debt securities to maturity.\n \nAllowance for Expected Credit Losses on Accounts Receivable \n— The Company recognizes an allowance for losses on accounts receivable in an amount equal to the current expected credit losses. The estimation of the allowance is based on an analysis of historical loss experience, current receivables aging, and management’s assessment of current conditions and reasonable and supportable expectation of future conditions, as well as an assessment of specific identifiable customer accounts considered at risk or uncollectible. The Company assesses collectibility by pooling receivables where similar characteristics exist and evaluates receivables individually when specific customer balances no longer share those risk characteristics and are considered at risk or uncollectible. The expense associated with the allowance for expected credit losses is recognized in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n86\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nAccounting for Operating Leases as a Lessee — \nIn its ordinary course of business, the Company enters into leases as a lessee for office buildings, warehouses, employee vehicles, and equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. The Company’s leases are generally classified as operating leases. The Company does not have any material finance leases. Operating leases result in the recognition of right of use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease, measured on a discounted basis. At lease commencement, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The operating lease ROU asset equals the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs, prepaid or deferred rent, and lease incentives. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. \nThe lease term may include options to extend or to terminate the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The Company has elected not to record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in most instances. The Company does not generate material sublease income and has no material related party leases. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe Company’s office building agreements contain costs such as common area maintenance and other executory costs that may be either fixed or variable in nature. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred. The Company combines lease and non-lease components, including fixed common area and other maintenance costs, in calculating the ROU assets and lease liabilities for its office buildings and employee vehicles. Under certain service agreements with third-party logistics providers, the Company directs the use of the inventory within the warehouses and, therefore, controls the assets. The warehouses and some of the equipment used are considered embedded leases. The Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components separately for its warehouses and equipment. The lease components consist of the warehouses and some of the equipment, such as conveyor belts. The non-lease components consist of services and other shared equipment, such as material handling and transportation. The Company allocates the consideration to the lease and non-lease components using their relative standalone values. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAccounting for Leases as a Lessor — \nThe Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Dell Financial Services and its affiliates (“DFS”) act as a lessor to provide equipment financing to customers through a variety of lease arrangements (“DFS leases”). The Company’s leases are classified as sales-type leases, direct financing leases, or operating leases. Direct financing leases are immaterial.\n \nThe Company also offers alternative payment structures and as-a-Service offerings that are assessed to determine whether an embedded lease arrangement exists. The Company accounts for those contracts as a lease arrangement if it is determined that the contract contains an identified asset and that control of that asset has transferred to the customer.\nWhen a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Company allocates consideration under the contract to each component based on relative standalone selling price and subsequently assesses lease classification for each lease component within a contract. DFS provides lessees with the option to extend the lease or purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term, which is considered when evaluating lease classification. In general, DFS lease arrangements do not have variable payment terms and are typically non-cancelable.\nOn commencement of sales-type leases, the Company recognizes profit up-front, and amounts due from the customer under the lease contract are recognized as financing receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Interest income is recognized as net product revenue over the term of the lease based on the effective interest method. The Company has elected not to include sales and other taxes collected from the lessee as part of lease revenue. \n87\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nAll other leases that do not meet the definition of a sales-type lease or direct financing lease are classified as operating leases. The underlying asset in an operating lease arrangement is carried at depreciated cost as “Assets in a customer contract” within Property, plant, and equipment, net on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the term of the underlying lease contract and is recognized as cost of net revenue. The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. The residual value is based upon estimates of the value of the equipment at the end of the lease term using historical studies, industry data, and future value-at-risk demand valuation methods. The Company recognizes operating lease income to product revenue generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term and expenses deferred initial direct costs on the same basis. The Company recognizes variable lease income to product revenue generally as earned. Impairment of assets in a customer contract is assessed on the same basis as other long-lived assets.\nFinancing Receivables \n— Financing receivables are presented net of allowance for losses and consist of customer receivables and residual interest. Gross customer receivables include amounts due from customers under revolving loans, fixed-term loans, fixed-term sales-type or direct financing leases, and accrued interest. The Company has \ntwo\n portfolios, consisting of (i) fixed-term leases and loans and (ii) revolving loans, and assesses risk at the portfolio level to determine the appropriate allowance levels. The portfolio segments are further segregated into classes based on products, customer type, and credit risk evaluation. Fixed-term leases and loans are offered to qualified small and medium-sized businesses, large commercial accounts, governmental organizations, and educational entities. Fixed-term loans are also offered to qualified individual consumers. Revolving loans were primarily offered to small and medium-sized business customers, with the remaining offerings discontinued during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.\nThe Company retains a residual interest in equipment leased under its fixed-term lease programs. The amount of the residual interest is established at the inception of the lease based upon estimates of the value of the equipment at the end of the lease term using historical studies, industry data, and future value-at-risk demand valuation methods.\nAllowance for Financing Receivable Losses \n— The Company recognizes an allowance for financing receivable losses, including both the lease receivable and unguaranteed residual, in an amount equal to the expected losses net of recoveries. The allowance for financing receivable losses on the lease receivable is determined based on various factors, including lifetime expected losses determined using macroeconomic forecast assumptions and management judgments applicable to and through the expected life of the portfolios as well as past due receivables, receivable type, and customer risk profile.\nGenerally, expected credit losses as a result of residual value risk on equipment under lease are not considered to be significant primarily because of the existence of a secondary market with respect to the equipment. The Company’s lease agreements also generally define applicable return conditions and remedies for non-compliance to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return. Model changes and updates, as well as market strength and product acceptance, are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any such changes.\nWhen an account is deemed to be uncollectible, customer account principal and interest are charged off to the allowance for losses. While the Company does not generally place financing receivables on non-accrual status during the delinquency period, accrued interest is included in the allowance for loss calculation and, therefore, the Company is adequately reserved in the event of charge off. Recoveries on receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are recorded to the allowance for financing receivable losses. The expense associated with the allowance for financing receivable losses is recognized as cost of net revenue.\n \nAsset Securitization \n— The Company transfers certain U.S. and European customer lease and loan payments and associated equipment to Special Purpose Entities (“SPEs”) that meet the definition of a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) and are consolidated into the Consolidated Financial Statements. These SPEs are bankruptcy-remote legal entities with separate assets and liabilities. The purpose of the SPEs is to facilitate the funding of customer lease and loan payments and associated equipment in the capital markets. Some of these SPEs have entered into financing arrangements with multi-seller conduits that, in turn, issue asset-backed debt securities in the capital markets. The asset securitizations in the SPEs are accounted for as secured borrowings.\n \nInventories \n— The Company generally records inventory on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position when legal title and risk of loss have passed to the Company for items that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business, that are in process of production for sale, or that will be consumed in the production of goods or services that will be held for sale. \n88\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in the newly established cost basis.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment \n— Property, plant, and equipment are carried at depreciated cost. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term, as applicable. \nThe estimated useful lives of the Company’s property, plant, and equipment are generally as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nComputer and other equipment\n3\n-\n5\n years\nAssets in a customer contract\nTerm of underlying lease contract\nBuildings and building improvements\n10\n-\n30\n years or term of underlying land lease\nLeasehold improvements\n5\n years or contract term\nInternal use software\n5\n years\nGains or losses related to retirements or dispositions of fixed assets are recognized in the period during which the retirement or disposition occurs.\nThe Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs to acquire or create internal use software which are incurred subsequent to the completion of the preliminary project stage. Costs associated with maintenance and minor enhancements to the features and functionality of the Company’s internal use software are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs \n— Software development costs related to the development of new product offerings are capitalized subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility, which is demonstrated by the completion of a detailed program design or working model, if no program design is completed. The Company amortizes capitalized software development costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the products, which is generally \ntwo years\n.\nAs of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, capitalized software development costs were $\n623\n million and $\n646\n million, respectively, and are included in other non-current assets, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Amortization expense for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023 was $\n325\n million, $\n416\n million, and $\n317\n million, respectively. \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n— The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the asset based on the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nIntangible Assets Including Goodwill \n— Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. Definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the asset may be impaired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred.\nForeign Currency Translation \n— The majority of the Company’s international sales are made by international subsidiaries, some of which have the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency. The Company’s subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency translate assets and liabilities at current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses from these international subsidiaries are translated using the monthly average exchange rates in effect for the period in which the activity was recognized. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) in stockholders’ equity (deficit).\n89\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nLocal currency transactions of international subsidiaries that have the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency are remeasured into U.S. Dollars using the current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange for nonmonetary assets and liabilities. Gains and losses from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are included in interest and other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for amounts recognized from remeasurement during the periods presented.\nHedging Instruments \n— The Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forward contracts, options, and swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions, are formally documented. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are measured at fair value. The Company’s hedge portfolio includes non-designated derivatives and derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and, from time to time, fair value hedges. \nFor derivative instruments designated as a cash flow hedge, the Company assesses hedge effectiveness at the onset of the hedge, then performs qualitative assessments at regular intervals throughout the life of the derivative. The gain or loss on the hedge is recorded in AOCI, as a separate component of stockholders’ equity (deficit), and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. For derivatives that are designated as a fair value hedge, the Company evaluates the effectiveness of the qualifying fair value hedge using the shortcut method of accounting under which hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective. The change in fair value of the hedge exactly offsets the fair value of the hedged item and there is no net impact recognized in earnings from the fair value of the derivative. For derivatives that are not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the Company recognizes the change in the instrument’s fair value in earnings as a component of interest and other, net.\nCash flows from derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the cash flows from the underlying hedged items.\n See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s derivative financial instrument activities.\nRevenue Recognition\n — The Company sells a wide portfolio of products and services to its customers. The Company’s agreements have varying requirements depending on the goods and services being sold, the rights and obligations conveyed, and the legal jurisdiction of the arrangement. While most of our agreements have standard terms and conditions, more complex agreements may contain nonstandard terms and conditions that require significant judgments in interpreting agreements to determine the appropriate accounting.\nRevenue is recognized for these arrangements based on the following five steps:\n(1)    Identify the contract with a customer.\n The Company evaluates facts and circumstances regarding sales transactions in order to identify contracts with its customers. An agreement must meet all of the following criteria to qualify as a contract eligible for revenue recognition under the model: (i) the contract must be approved by all parties who are committed to perform their respective obligations; (ii) each party’s rights regarding the goods and services to be transferred to the customer can be identified; (iii) the payment terms for the goods and services can be identified; (iv) the customer has the ability and intent to pay and it is probable that the Company will collect substantially all of the consideration to which it will be entitled; and (v) the contract must have commercial substance. Judgment is used in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based upon various factors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or customer credit and financial information.\n    \n90\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(2)    Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\n The Company’s contracts with customers often include the promise to transfer multiple goods and services to the customer. Distinct promises within a contract are referred to as “performance obligations” and are accounted for as separate units of account. The Company assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such goods or services are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct); and (ii) the Company’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). The Company’s performance obligations include various distinct goods and services such as hardware, software licenses, support and maintenance agreements, and other service offerings and solutions. Promised goods and services are explicitly identified in the Company’s contracts and may be sold on a standalone basis or bundled as part of a combined solution. In certain hardware solutions, the hardware is highly interdependent on, and interrelated with, the embedded software. In these offerings, the hardware and software licenses are accounted for as a single performance obligation. \n(3)    Determine the transaction price.\n The transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount to which it expects to be entitled using either the expected value or most likely amount method. Generally, volume discounts, rebates, and sales returns reduce the transaction price. In determining the transaction price, the Company only includes amounts that are not subject to significant future reversal.\n(4)    Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. \nWhen a contract includes multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated in proportion to the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of each performance obligation.\nThe best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a good or service when the Company sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. If a directly observable price is available, the Company will utilize that price for the SSP. If a directly observable price is not available, the SSP must be estimated. The Company estimates SSP by considering multiple factors, including, but not limited to, pricing practices, internal costs, and profit objectives as well as overall market conditions, which include geographic or regional specific factors, competitive positioning, and competitor actions. \n(5)    Recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. \nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with the Company’s customer are satisfied. Revenue is recognized either over time or at a point in time, depending on when the underlying products or services are transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized at a point in time for products upon transfer of control. Revenue is recognized over time for support and deployment services, software support, Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (“IaaS”). Revenue is recognized either over time or at a point in time for professional services and training depending on the nature of the offering to the customer. \nThe Company reports revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrently with specific revenue-producing transactions.\n91\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe Company has elected the following practical expedients:\n•\nThe Company does not account for significant financing components if the period between revenue recognition and when the customer pays for the product or service will be one year or less.\n•\nThe Company recognizes revenue equal to the amount it has a right to invoice when the amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance to date.\n•\nThe Company does not account for shipping and handling activities as a separate performance obligation, but rather as an activity performed to transfer the promised good.\nThe following summarizes the nature of revenue recognized and the manner in which the Company accounts for sales transactions.\nProducts\nProduct revenue consists of revenue from sales of hardware products, including notebooks and desktop PCs, servers, storage hardware, and other hardware-related devices, as well as revenue from software license sales, including non-essential software applications and third-party software licenses. \nRevenue from sales of hardware products is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which typically occurs when the hardware has been shipped to the customer, risk of loss has transferred to the customer, the Company has a present right to payment, and customer acceptance has been satisfied. Customer acceptance is satisfied if acceptance is obtained from the customer, if all acceptance provisions lapse, or if the Company has evidence that all acceptance provisions will be, or have been, satisfied. Revenue from software license sales is generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which is typically upon shipment, electronic delivery, or when the software is available for download by the customer. For certain software arrangements in which the customer is granted a right to additional unspecified future software licenses, the Company’s promise to the customer is considered a stand-ready obligation in which the transfer of control and revenue recognition will occur over time. \nServices\nServices revenue consists of revenue from sales of support services, including hardware support that extends beyond the Company’s standard warranties, software maintenance, and installation; professional services; training; SaaS; and IaaS. Revenue associated with undelivered performance obligations is deferred and recognized when or as control is transferred to the customer. Revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts sold for both hardware and software is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of performance because the Company is required to provide services at any given time. Other services revenue is recognized when the Company performs the services and the customer receives and consumes the benefits.\nOther\nRevenue from leasing arrangements is not subject to the revenue standard for contracts with customers and remains separately accounted for under lease accounting guidance. The Company records operating lease rental revenue as product revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company records revenue under sales-type leases as product revenue in an amount equal to the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease. Sales-type leases also produce financing income, which is included in product net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is recognized at effective rates of return over the lease term. The Company also offers qualified customers fixed-term loans as well as previously offered revolving lines of credit through DFS for the purchase of products and services offered by the Company. Financing income attributable to these loans is recognized in product net revenue on an accrual basis. \n92\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nPrincipal versus Agent\n — For transactions that involve a third party, the Company evaluates whether it is acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction. This determination requires significant judgment and impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized. If the Company determines that it controls a good or service before it is transferred to the customer, the Company is acting as the principal and recognizes revenue at the gross amount of consideration it is entitled to from the customer. Indicators that the Company controls a good or service before transferring it to a customer include, but are not limited to, the Company being the primary obligor to the customer, establishing its own pricing, and having inventory and credit risks. Conversely, if the Company determines that it does not control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer, the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction. As an agent, the Company is arranging for the good or service to be provided by another party and recognizes revenue at the net amount of consideration retained.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\n — The Company’s revenue is presented on a disaggregated basis on the Consolidated Statements of Income and in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements based on an evaluation of disclosures outside of the financial statements, information regularly provided to and reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker for evaluating the financial performance of operating segments, and other information that is used to evaluate the Company’s financial performance and make resource allocations. This information includes revenue from products and services, revenue from reportable segments, and revenue by major product categories within the segments. \nContract Assets \n— Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer when such a right is conditional on criteria other than the passage of time. Such amounts are immaterial as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024. \nContract Liabilities \n— Contract liabilities primarily consist of deferred revenue. Deferred revenue is recorded when the Company has invoiced or payments have been received for undelivered products or services, or in situations where revenue recognition criteria have not been met. Deferred revenue primarily includes amounts received in advance for extended warranty services and software maintenance. Revenue is recognized on these items when the revenue recognition criteria are met, generally resulting in ratable recognition over the contract term. The Company also has deferred revenue related to undelivered hardware and professional services, consisting of installations and consulting engagements, which are recognized when the Company’s performance obligations under the contract are completed. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about deferred revenue. \nDeferred Costs \n— Deferred costs primarily consist of\n \ncosts incurred to fulfill or obtain a contract and are included within other current assets and other non-current assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, based on when the expense is expected to be recognized. \nCosts incurred to fulfill revenue-generating contracts are mainly associated with third-party software support and maintenance offerings and VMware Resale offerings discussed in Note 18 and Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company defers and subsequently amortizes these charges\n \non a straight-line basis over the life of the contract or the average contract\n \nduration. Amortization expense is included in cost of net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred costs to fulfill revenue-generating contracts as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024 were $\n4.8\n billion and $\n7.7\n billion, respectively. Amortization of deferred costs to fulfill revenue-generating contracts during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023 was $\n7.6\n billion, $\n8.0\n billion, and $\n7.3\n billion, respectively.\nThe Company capitalizes incremental direct costs to obtain a contract, primarily sales commissions and employer taxes related to commission payments, if the costs are deemed to be recoverable. The Company has elected, as a practical expedient, to expense as incurred costs to obtain a contract equal to or less than one year in duration. Capitalized costs are deferred and amortized over the period of contract performance or the estimated life of the customer relationship, if renewals are expected, and are typically amortized over an average period of \none\n to \nfive years\n. Amortization expense is recognized on a straight-line basis and included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred costs to obtain a contract as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024 were $\n540\n million and $\n674\n million, respectively. Amortization of costs to obtain a contract during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023 was $\n346\n million, $\n383\n million, and $\n390\n million, respectively.\n93\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe Company periodically reviews these deferred costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the carrying value or period of benefit of the costs to fulfill or costs to obtain a contract. There were no material impairment losses for deferred costs during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023.\nStandard Warranty Liabilities \n— The Company records warranty liabilities for estimated costs of fulfilling its obligations under standard limited hardware and software warranties at the time of sale. The liabilities for standard warranties are included in accrued and other and in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The specific warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which the Company does business, but generally include technical support, parts, and labor over a period ranging from \none\n to \nthree years\n. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liabilities include the number of installed units currently under warranty, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims on those units, and cost per claim to satisfy the Company’s warranty obligation. The anticipated rate of warranty claims is the primary estimate used in determining the warranty liability and is relatively predictable using historical experience of failure rates. The average remaining aggregate warranty period of the covered installed base is approximately \n17\n months, repair parts are generally already in stock or available at pre-determined prices, and labor rates are generally arranged at preestablished amounts with service providers. If actual results differ from the estimates, the Company revises its estimated warranty liability. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. See Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about standard warranty liabilities.\n \nConsideration Received from Vendors \n— The Company may receive consideration from vendors in the normal course of business. Certain of these funds received as consideration are rebates of purchase price paid and others are related to reimbursement of costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendor’s products. The Company recognizes a reduction to cost of net revenue if the funds are determined to be a reduction of the price of the vendor’s products. If the consideration is a reimbursement of costs incurred by the Company to sell or develop the vendor’s products, the consideration is classified as a reduction of such costs, most often operating expenses, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In order to be recognized as a reduction of operating expenses, the reimbursement must be for a specific, incremental, and identifiable cost incurred by the Company in selling the vendor’s products or services.\nLoss Contingencies \n— The Company is subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. In determining loss contingencies, the Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as the Company’s ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.\nShipping Costs \n— The Company’s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nSelling, General, and Administrative \n— Selling expenses include items such as sales salaries and commissions, marketing and advertising costs, and contractor services. Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023, advertising expenses were $\n0.8\n billion, $\n0.9\n billion, and $\n1.1\n billion, respectively. General and administrative expenses include items for the Company’s administrative functions, such as finance, legal, human resources, and information technology support. These functions include costs for items such as salaries and benefits and other personnel-related costs, maintenance and supplies, outside services, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation expense.\nResearch and Development \n— Research and development (“R&D”) costs are primarily expensed as incurred. As noted in Capitalized Software Development Costs in this Note, qualifying software development costs are capitalized and amortized over time. R&D costs include salaries and benefits and other personnel-related costs associated with product development. Also included in R&D expenses are infrastructure costs, which consist of equipment and material costs, facilities-related costs, and depreciation expense.\n94\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nIncome Taxes \n— The Company calculates a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company accounts for the tax impact of including Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) in U.S. taxable income as a period cost. The Company provides valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, where appropriate. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event the Company determines that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that will be charged to earnings in the period in which such a determination is made.\nThe accounting guidance for uncertainties in income tax prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits and a consideration of the relevant taxing authority’s administrative practices and precedents.\nStock-Based Compensation \n— The Company measures stock-based compensation expense for all share-based awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. To estimate the fair value of performance-based awards containing a market condition, the Company uses the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of other share-based awards is generally based on the closing price of the Class C Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) on the date of grant.\nThe compensation cost of service-based stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units is recognized net of any estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis over the employee requisite service period. Compensation cost for performance-based awards is recognized on a graded accelerated basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at grant date based on historical experience and adjusted in subsequent periods for differences in actual forfeitures from those estimates.\n \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nExpense Disaggregation Disclosures — \nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance to improve disclosures about a public entity’s expenses by requiring disclosure of additional information about the types of expenses commonly presented in the financial statement on an annual and interim basis. Public entities must adopt the new guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. Adoption of this new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes \n— In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance which requires companies to provide disaggregated income tax disclosures within the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. Public entities must adopt the new guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt the guidance prospectively. Adoption of this new guidance will result in increased disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSegment Reporting\n — In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to improve disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments by requiring disclosure of additional information about a reportable segment’s expenses on an annual and interim basis. The Company adopted this standard as of January 31, 2025 on a retrospective basis. Adoption of this new guidance resulted in increased disclosures on reportable segments in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n95\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 3 — \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following table presents the Company’s hierarchy for its assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated:\n \nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\n \nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\n \nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\n \nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\n \n \n(in millions)\nAssets:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMoney market funds\n$\n571\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n571\n \n$\n3,170\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,170\n \nMarketable equity and other securities\n8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n8\n \n10\n \n—\n \n—\n \n10\n \nDerivative instruments\n—\n \n302\n \n—\n \n302\n \n—\n \n104\n \n—\n \n104\n \nTotal assets\n$\n579\n \n$\n302\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n881\n \n$\n3,180\n \n$\n104\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,284\n \nLiabilities:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDerivative instruments\n$\n—\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n84\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n84\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n—\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n84\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n84\n \nThe following section describes the valuation methodologies the Company uses to measure financial instruments at fair value.\nMoney Market Funds \n— The Company’s investment in money market funds that are classified as cash equivalents hold underlying investments with a weighted average maturity of 90 days or less and are recognized at fair value. The valuations of these securities are based on quoted prices for identical assets in active markets, when available, or pricing models whereby all significant inputs are observable, can be derived from, or can be corroborated by, observable market data. The Company reviews security pricing and assesses money market fund liquidity on a quarterly basis. As of January 31, 2025, the Company’s portfolio had no material exposure to money market funds with a fluctuating net asset value.\n \nMarketable Equity and Other Securities \n— The Company’s investments in equity and other securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of strategic investments in publicly-traded companies. The valuation of these securities is based on quoted prices in active markets.\nDerivative Instruments\n — The Company’s derivative financial instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward and purchased option contracts and interest rate swaps. The fair value of the portfolio is determined using valuation models based on market observable inputs, including interest rate curves, forward and spot prices for currencies, and implied volatilities. Credit risk is also factored into the fair value calculation of the Company’s derivative financial instrument portfolio. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s derivative financial instrument activities.\nDeferred Compensation Plans \n— The Company offers deferred compensation plans for eligible employees which allow participants to defer a portion of their compensation. Assets and liabilities associated with the plans are measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Assets were the same as liabilities associated with the plans at approximately $\n244\n million and $\n214\n million as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, respectively, and are included in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The net impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income is not material since changes in the fair value of the assets substantially offset changes in the fair value of the liabilities. As such, assets and liabilities associated with these plans have not been included in the recurring fair value table above.\n \n96\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\n — Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the recurring fair value table above. These assets consist primarily of financial assets such as the Company’s fixed income debt securities and strategic investments in non-marketable equity and other securities and non-financial assets such as goodwill and intangible assets. \nFixed income debt securities are recorded at amortized cost and approximate fair value. The fair value of fixed income debt securities is determined based on observable market prices in a less active market or based on valuation methodologies using observable inputs. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, these securities would generally be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company’s fixed income debt securities.\nStrategic investments in non-marketable equity and other securities and certain non-financial assets such as goodwill and intangibles are measured at fair value only if they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price changes in the current period. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, these securities would generally be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 4 and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company’s investments and goodwill and intangible assets, respectively.\nCarrying Value and Estimated Fair Value of Outstanding Debt \n— The following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt as described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the current portion, as of the dates indicated:\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\n(in billions)\nSenior Notes\n$\n15.0\n \n$\n15.0\n \n$\n15.5\n \n$\n15.8\n \nLegacy Notes\n$\n0.9\n \n$\n1.0\n \n$\n0.9\n \n$\n1.0\n \nDFS Debt\n$\n8.7\n \n$\n8.5\n \n$\n9.5\n \n$\n9.1\n \nThe fair values of the outstanding debt shown in the table above were determined based on observable market prices in a less active market or based on valuation methodologies using observable inputs and were categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n97\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 4 — \nINVESTMENTS\nThe Company has strategic investments in equity and other securities as well as investments in fixed income debt securities. All equity and other securities as well as long-term fixed income debt securities are recorded as long-term investments while short-term fixed income debt securities are recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. \nAs of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, total investments were $\n1.5\n billion and $\n1.6\n billion, respectively.\nEquity and Other Securities\nEquity and other securities include strategic investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Investments in marketable securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Investments in non-marketable equity and other securities represent primarily early-stage companies without readily determinable fair values. The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative for non-marketable securities. Under the alternative, the Company measures investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes. The Company makes a separate election to use the alternative for each eligible investment and is required to reassess at each reporting period whether an investment qualifies for the alternative. In evaluating these investments for impairment or observable price changes, the Company uses inputs including pre- and post-money valuations of recent financing events and the impact of those events on its fully diluted ownership percentages, as well as other available information regarding the issuer’s historical and forecasted performance.\nCarrying Value of Equity and Other Securities\nThe following table presents the cost, cumulative unrealized gain, cumulative unrealized loss, and carrying value of the Company's strategic investments in marketable and non-marketable equity and other securities as of the dates indicated: \nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nCost\nUnrealized Gain\nUnrealized Loss\nCarrying Value\nCost\nUnrealized Gain\nUnrealized Loss\nCarrying Value\n(in millions)\nMarketable\n$\n11\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n(\n27\n)\n$\n8\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n(\n26\n)\n$\n10\n \nNon-marketable\n739\n \n1,009\n \n(\n261\n)\n1,487\n \n732\n \n1,015\n \n(\n454\n)\n1,293\n \nTotal equity and other securities\n$\n750\n \n$\n1,033\n \n$\n(\n288\n)\n$\n1,495\n \n$\n744\n \n$\n1,039\n \n$\n(\n480\n)\n$\n1,303\n \n98\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nGains and Losses on Equity and Other Securities\nThe following table presents unrealized gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity and other securities for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions)\nMarketable securities:\nUnrealized gain\n$\n5\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n57\n \nUnrealized loss\n(\n6\n)\n(\n24\n)\n(\n47\n)\nNet unrealized gain (loss)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n18\n)\n10\n \nNon-marketable securities:\nUnrealized gain\n154\n \n84\n \n90\n \nUnrealized loss\n(\n32\n)\n(\n49\n)\n(\n349\n)\nNet unrealized gain (loss) (a) (b)\n122\n \n35\n \n(\n259\n)\nNet unrealized gain (loss) on equity and other securities\n$\n121\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n(\n249\n)\n____________________\n(a)\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, net unrealized gains on non-marketable securities were due to upward adjustments for observable price changes offset by losses primarily attributable to downward adjustments for observable price changes and impairments.\n(b)\nFor the fiscal year ended February 3, 2023, net unrealized losses on non-marketable securities were primarily attributable to the recognition of impairments which were generally in line with extended public equity market declines.\n \nFixed Income Debt Securities \nAs of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, the Company held fixed income debt securities of $\n27\n million and $\n301\n million, respectively, which it intends to hold to maturity. These investments are recorded at amortized cost and approximate fair value. As of January 31, 2025, the Company held $\n26\n million in fixed income debt securities which will mature within one year and $\n1\n million in fixed income debt securities which will mature within five years.\n99\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 5 — \nFINANCIAL SERVICES \nThe Company offers or arranges a portfolio of payment and consumption solutions and services for its customers globally, including as-a-Service, subscription, utility, leases, and loans designed to match customers' consumption and financing preferences, and provide operational and financial flexibility. \nTo support financing solutions and services as part of the portfolio, DFS originates, collects, and services customer financing arrangements primarily related to the purchase and use of Dell Technologies products and services. In some cases, the Company also offers financing for the purchase of third-party technology products that complement the Dell Technologies portfolio of products and services. New financing originations were $\n8.4\n billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024 and $\n9.7\n billion for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2023.\nThe Company’s financing arrangements with customers are aggregated primarily into the following categories:\nFixed-term leases and loans \n— The Company enters into financing arrangements with customers who seek lease financing for equipment. Leases are generally classified as sales-type leases or operating leases. Additionally, utility, subscription, and as-a-Service flexible consumption models may result in identification of embedded lease arrangements that lead to the recognition of sales-type leases or operating leases. Leases with business customers have fixed terms of generally \ntwo\n to \nfour years\n. \nThe Company also offers fixed-term loans to qualified small businesses, large commercial accounts, governmental organizations, educational entities, and certain individual consumer customers. These loans are repaid in equal payments including interest and have defined terms of generally \nthree\n to \nfive years\n. The fair value of the fixed-term loan portfolio is determined using market observable inputs. The carrying value of these loans approximates fair value.\nRevolving loans\n — The Company primarily offered revolving loans to small and medium-sized commercial customers. Revolving loans provide qualified customers with a revolving credit line for the purchase of products and services offered by Dell Technologies. Revolving loans in the United States bear interest at a variable annual percentage rate that is tied to the prime rate. Based on historical payment patterns, revolving loan transactions are typically repaid within \ntwelve months\n on average. Due to the short-term nature of the revolving loan portfolio, the carrying value of the portfolio approximates fair value.\nPrior to the sale of the U.S. consumer revolving customer receivables portfolio on October 4, 2023 described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company offered private label credit financing under the Dell Preferred Account (“DPA”) program. The DPA product was primarily offered to individual consumer customers. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, the Company discontinued remaining offerings under the revolving loan portfolio. The Company will support existing customer arrangements as well as transition these customers to fixed-term offerings. \n100\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFinancing Receivables\nThe following table presents the components of the Company’s financing receivables segregated by portfolio segment as of the dates indicated:\n \nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nRevolving\nFixed-term\nTotal\nRevolving\nFixed-term\nTotal\n \n(in millions)\nFinancing receivables, net:\n \n \nCustomer receivables, gross (a)\n$\n86\n \n$\n11,130\n \n$\n11,216\n \n$\n173\n \n$\n10,360\n \n$\n10,533\n \nAllowances for losses\n(\n6\n)\n(\n147\n)\n(\n153\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n161\n)\n(\n170\n)\nCustomer receivables, net\n80\n \n10,983\n \n11,063\n \n164\n \n10,199\n \n10,363\n \nResidual interest\n—\n \n168\n \n168\n \n—\n \n157\n \n157\n \nFinancing receivables, net\n$\n80\n \n$\n11,151\n \n$\n11,231\n \n$\n164\n \n$\n10,356\n \n$\n10,520\n \nShort-term\n$\n80\n \n$\n5,224\n \n$\n5,304\n \n$\n164\n \n$\n4,479\n \n$\n4,643\n \nLong-term\n$\n—\n \n$\n5,927\n \n$\n5,927\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5,877\n \n$\n5,877\n \n____________________\n(a)\nCustomer receivables, gross include amounts due from customers under revolving loans, fixed-term loans, fixed-term leases, and accrued interest.\nThe following table presents the changes in allowance for financing receivable losses for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\nRevolving\nFixed-term\nTotal\nRevolving\nFixed-term\nTotal\nRevolving\nFixed-term\nTotal\n(in millions)\nAllowance for financing receivable losses:\nBalances at beginning of period\n$\n9\n \n$\n161\n \n$\n170\n \n$\n88\n \n$\n113\n \n$\n201\n \n$\n102\n \n$\n87\n \n$\n189\n \nCharge-offs, net of recoveries\n(\n12\n)\n(\n59\n)\n(\n71\n)\n(\n41\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n49\n)\n(\n52\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n60\n)\nProvision charged to income statement\n9\n \n45\n \n54\n \n36\n \n56\n \n92\n \n38\n \n34\n \n72\n \nOther (a)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n74\n)\n—\n \n(\n74\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nBalances at end of period\n$\n6\n \n$\n147\n \n$\n153\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n161\n \n$\n170\n \n$\n88\n \n$\n113\n \n$\n201\n \n____________________\n(a)\nOther represents the derecognition of the allowance for financing receivable losses related to the sale of the U.S. consumer revolving customer receivables portfolio described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \nThe Company recognizes an allowance for financing receivable losses, including both the lease receivable and unguaranteed residual, in an amount equal to the expected losses net of recoveries. The allowance for financing receivable losses on the lease receivable is determined based on various factors, including lifetime expected losses determined using macroeconomic forecast assumptions and management judgments applicable to and through the expected life of the portfolios as well as past due receivables, receivable type, and customer risk profile. The Company continues to monitor broader economic indicators and their potential impact on future credit loss performance. \n101\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nAging\nThe following table presents the aging of the Company’s customer financing receivables, gross, including accrued interest, segregated by class, as of the dates indicated:\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nCurrent\nPast Due\n1 — 90 Days\nPast Due\n>90 Days\nTotal\nCurrent\nPast Due\n1 — 90 Days\nPast Due\n>90 Days\nTotal\n(in millions)\nRevolving\n$\n69\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n151\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n173\n \nFixed-term\n10,727\n \n189\n \n214\n \n11,130\n \n9,345\n \n889\n \n126\n \n10,360\n \nTotal customer receivables, gross\n$\n10,796\n \n$\n201\n \n$\n219\n \n$\n11,216\n \n$\n9,496\n \n$\n906\n \n$\n131\n \n$\n10,533\n \nAging is likely to fluctuate as a result of the variability in volume of large transactions entered into over the period, and the administrative processes that accompany those transactions. Aging is also impacted by the timing of the Company’s fiscal period end date relative to calendar month-end customer payment due dates. As a result of these factors, fluctuations in aging from period to period do not necessarily indicate a material change in the collectibility of the portfolio.\nFixed-term customer receivables are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest is past due and considered delinquent, or if there is concern about the collectibility of a specific customer receivable. The receivables identified as doubtful for collectibility may be classified as current for aging purposes. Aged revolving portfolio customer receivables identified as delinquent are charged off.\nCredit Quality\nThe following tables present customer receivables, gross, including accrued interest, by credit quality indicator, segregated by class, as of the dates indicated: \nJanuary 31, 2025\nFixed-term — Fiscal Year of Origination\n2025\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\nYears Prior\nRevolving\nTotal\n(in millions)\nHigher\n$\n2,284\n \n$\n2,160\n \n$\n1,217\n \n$\n357\n \n$\n102\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n6,135\n \nMid\n2,431\n \n695\n \n464\n \n107\n \n17\n \n4\n \n24\n \n3,742\n \nLower\n501\n \n407\n \n283\n \n68\n \n28\n \n1\n \n51\n \n1,339\n \nTotal\n$\n5,216\n \n$\n3,262\n \n$\n1,964\n \n$\n532\n \n$\n147\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n11,216\n \nFebruary 2, 2024\nFixed-term — Fiscal Year of Origination\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nYears Prior\nRevolving\nTotal\n(in millions)\nHigher\n$\n3,261\n \n$\n1,979\n \n$\n833\n \n$\n345\n \n$\n64\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n6,529\n \nMid\n1,111\n \n911\n \n290\n \n86\n \n19\n \n—\n \n50\n \n2,467\n \nLower\n703\n \n469\n \n187\n \n80\n \n21\n \n1\n \n76\n \n1,537\n \nTotal\n$\n5,075\n \n$\n3,359\n \n$\n1,310\n \n$\n511\n \n$\n104\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n173\n \n$\n10,533\n \nThe categories shown in the tables above segregate customer receivables based on the relative degrees of credit risk.

The grading criteria and classifications for the fixed-term products differ from those for the revolving products as loss experience varies between these product and customer groups. The credit quality categories cannot be compared between the different classes as loss experience varies substantially between the classes.\nLeases\nThe following table presents amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to sales-type lease activity for the periods indicated: \nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions)\nInterest income \n—\n products\n$\n305\n \n$\n175\n \n$\n161\n \nNet revenue \n—\n products\n$\n1,992\n \n$\n1,140\n \n$\n851\n \nCost of net revenue \n—\n products\n1,703\n \n854\n \n727\n \nGross margin \n—\n products\n$\n289\n \n$\n286\n \n$\n124\n \nThe following table presents the future maturity of the Company’s fixed-term customer leases and associated financing payments, and reconciles the undiscounted cash flows to the customer receivables, gross recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of the date indicated: \nJanuary 31, 2025\n(in millions)\nFiscal 2026\n$\n3,327\n \nFiscal 2027\n2,296\n \nFiscal 2028\n998\n \nFiscal 2029\n477\n \nFiscal 2030 and thereafter\n218\n \nTotal undiscounted cash flows\n7,316\n \nFixed-term loans\n4,914\n \nRevolving loans\n86\n \nLess: Unearned income\n(\n1,100\n)\nTotal customer receivables, gross\n$\n11,216\n \nOperating Leases\nThe Company’s operating leases primarily consist of fixed-term leases and contractually committed embedded leases identified within flexible consumption arrangements.\nThe following table presents the components of the Company’s operating lease portfolio included in property, plant, and equipment, net as of the dates indicated: \nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\n(in millions)\nEquipment under operating lease, gross\n$\n4,180\n \n$\n4,002\n \nLess: Accumulated depreciation\n(\n1,995\n)\n(\n1,800\n)\nEquipment under operating lease, net\n$\n2,185\n \n$\n2,202\n \n103\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe following table presents operating lease income related to lease payments and depreciation expense for the Company’s operating lease portfolio for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions)\nIncome related to lease payments\n$\n1,473\n \n$\n1,353\n \n$\n1,091\n \nDepreciation expense \n$\n956\n \n$\n941\n \n$\n803\n \nThe following table presents the future payments to be received by the Company in operating lease contracts as of the date indicated:\nJanuary 31, 2025\n(in millions)\nFiscal 2026\n$\n1,208\n \nFiscal 2027\n771\n \nFiscal 2028\n415\n \nFiscal 2029\n141\n \nFiscal 2030 and thereafter\n42\n \nTotal\n$\n2,577\n \nDFS Debt\nThe Company maintains programs that facilitate the funding of leases, loans, and other alternative payment structures in the capital markets.

This debt is collateralized solely by the U.S. lease and loan payments and associated equipment in the facility. The asset-based financing facility consists of \ntwo\n tranches, with effective dates through July 7, 2025 and July 7, 2026, respectively. As of January 31, 2025, the total debt capacity related to the asset-based financing facility was $\n5.0\n billion. The debt has a variable interest rate, and the duration of the debt is based on the terms of the underlying lease and loan payment streams. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to economically convert a portion of this debt from a floating rate to a fixed rate. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company’s interest rate swaps.\nThe asset-based financing facility contains standard structural features related to the performance of the funded receivables, which include defined credit losses, delinquencies, average credit scores, and minimum collection requirements. In the event one or more of these criteria are not met and the Company is unable to restructure the facility, no further funding of receivables will be permitted and the timing of the Company’s expected cash flows from over-collateralization will be delayed. As of January 31, 2025, these criteria were met.\nFixed-Term Securitization Offerings \n—\n \nThe Company periodically issues asset-backed debt securities under fixed-term securitization programs to private investors. The asset-backed debt securities are collateralized solely by the U.S. fixed-term lease and loan payments and associated equipment, which are held by Special Purpose Entities (“SPEs”), as discussed below. The interest rate on these securities is fixed and ranges from \n4.14\n% to \n6.80\n% per annum as of January 31, 2025, and the duration of these securities is based on the terms of the underlying lease and loan payment streams.\nDFS International Debt\nSecuritization Facility \n—\n \nThe Company maintains a securitization facility in Europe for fixed-term leases and loans. The debt under this facility has a variable interest rate, and the duration of the debt is based on the terms of the underlying lease and loan payment streams. This facility is effective through December 22, 2026 and had a total debt capacity of $\n831\n million as of January 31, 2025. \nThe securitization facility contains standard structural features related to the performance of the securitized receivables, which include defined credit losses, delinquencies, average credit scores, and minimum collection requirements. In the event one or more of these criteria are not met and the Company is unable to restructure the program, no further funding of receivables will be permitted and the timing of the Company’s expected cash flows from over-collateralization will be delayed. As of January 31, 2025, these criteria were met.\nOther Borrowings \n—\n \nIn connection with the Company’s international financing operations, the Company has entered into revolving structured financing debt programs related to its fixed-term lease and loan products sold in Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and Singapore. The debt under these programs has a variable interest rate. \nThe duration of the debt in Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East is based on the terms of the underlying lease and loan payment streams. These facilities are collateralized solely by the lease and loan payments and associated equipment in their respective region or country. The Canadian facility had a total debt capacity of $\n242\n million as of January 31, 2025 and is effective through January 15, 2028. The European facility had a total debt capacity of\n \n$\n520\n million as of January 31, 2025 and is effective through December 14, 2026. The Australia and New Zealand facility had a total debt capacity of $\n279\n million as of January 31, 2025 and is effective through April 20, 2025. The Middle East facility had a total debt capacity of $\n150\n million as of January 31, 2025 and was effective through March 24, 2025. Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, the Company extended the term of the Middle East facility to be effective through March 14, 2027.\nThe Company also has \ntwo\n unsecured Singapore facilities with a total debt capacity of $\n244\n million as of January 31, 2025 that are effective through July 3, 2026 and July 3, 2027, respectively. \n105\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNote Payable \n— \nOn May 25, 2022, the Company entered into an unsecured credit agreement which had an aggregate principal amount of $\n250\n million to fund receivables in Mexico. The note bore interest at an annual rate of \n4.24\n% and was paid in full on May 31, 2024.\nDell Bank Senior Unsecured Eurobonds \n—\n On October 27, 2021, Dell Bank issued \n500\n million Euro of \n0.5\n% senior unsecured \nfive year\n eurobonds due October 2026. On October 18, 2022, Dell Bank issued \n500\n million Euro of \n4.5\n% senior unsecured \nfive year\n eurobonds due October 2027. On June 13, 2024, Dell Bank issued \n500\n million Euro of \n3.6\n% senior unsecured \nfive year\n eurobonds due June 2029. The issuances of the senior unsecured eurobonds support the expansion of the financing operations in Europe.\nVariable Interest Entities\nIn connection with the asset-based financing facility, securitization facility, and fixed-term securitization offerings discussed above, the Company transfers certain U.S. and European lease and loan payments and associated equipment to SPEs that meet the definition of a VIE and are consolidated, along with the associated debt described above, into the Consolidated Financial Statements, as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. The SPEs are bankruptcy-remote legal entities with separate assets and liabilities. The purpose of the SPEs is to facilitate the funding of customer lease and loan payments and associated equipment in the capital markets.\nSome of the SPEs have entered into financing arrangements with multi-seller conduits that, in turn, issue asset-backed debt securities in the capital markets. DFS debt outstanding held by the consolidated VIEs is collateralized by the lease and loan payments and associated equipment. The Company’s risk of loss related to securitized receivables is limited to the amount by which the Company’s right to receive collections for assets securitized exceeds the amount required to pay interest, principal, and fees and expenses related to the asset-backed securities. The Company provides credit enhancement to the securitization in the form of over-collateralization.\nThe following table presents the assets and liabilities held by the consolidated VIEs as of the dates indicated, which are included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position:\n \nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\n \n(in millions)\nAssets held by consolidated VIEs\nOther current assets\n$\n123\n \n$\n136\n \nFinancing receivables, net of allowance\nShort-term\n$\n3,262\n \n$\n3,314\n \nLong-term\n$\n2,725\n \n$\n2,747\n \nProperty, plant, and equipment, net\n$\n984\n \n$\n1,081\n \nLiabilities held by consolidated VIEs\nDebt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs\nShort-term\n$\n4,598\n \n$\n4,450\n \nLong-term\n$\n1,788\n \n$\n2,184\n \nLease and loan payments and associated equipment transferred via securitization through SPEs were $\n3.6\n billion and $\n4.6\n billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, respectively.\nCustomer Receivables Sales\nTo manage certain concentrations of customer credit exposure, the Company may sell selected fixed-term customer receivables to unrelated third parties on a periodic basis, without recourse. The amount of customer receivables sold for this purpose was $\n79\n million, $\n222\n million, and $\n680\n million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023, respectively. The Company’s continuing involvement in these customer receivables is primarily limited to servicing arrangements.\n106\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 6 — \nLEASES \nThe Company enters into leasing transactions in which the Company is the lessee. These lease contracts are typically classified as operating leases. The Company’s lease contracts are generally for office buildings used to conduct its business, and the determination of whether such contracts contain leases generally does not require significant estimates or judgments. The Company also leases certain global logistics warehouses, employee vehicles, and equipment. As of January 31, 2025, the remaining terms of the Company’s leases range from \none month\n to approximately \neleven years\n.

The revolving credit facility also allows the Company to obtain incremental additional commitments on one or more occasions in minimum amounts of $\n10\n million. \nBorrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at the borrowers’ option, either (a) the specified adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) or (b) a base rate. The margin applicable to SOFR and base rate borrowings varies based upon the Company’s existing credit ratings. The base rate is calculated based upon the greatest of the specified prime rate, the specified federal reserve bank rate, or SOFR plus \n1\n%. The borrowers may voluntarily repay outstanding loans at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs. The facility matures on November 1, 2027. \n109\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nAs of January 31, 2025, the Company had \nno\n outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\nCommercial Paper Program\n — The Company maintains a commercial paper program under which the Company may issue unsecured notes in a maximum aggregate face amount of $\n5.0\n billion outstanding at any time, with maturities of up to \n397\n days from the date of issuance. The notes are sold on customary terms in the U.S. commercial paper market on a private placement basis. The proceeds of the notes are used for general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2025, the Company had \nno\n outstanding issuances under the commercial paper program.\nThe Company may purchase, redeem, prepay, refinance, or otherwise retire any amount of outstanding indebtedness under the terms of such indebtedness at any time and from time to time, in open market or negotiated transactions with the holders of such indebtedness or otherwise, as considered appropriate in light of market conditions and other relevant factors.\nCovenants\n — The credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes and the Legacy Notes impose various limitations, subject to exceptions, on creating certain liens and entering into sale and lease-back transactions. The foregoing credit agreement and indentures contain customary events of default, and the revolving credit facility is subject to an interest coverage ratio covenant that is tested at the end of each fiscal quarter with respect to the Company’s preceding four fiscal quarters. The Company was in compliance with this financial covenant as of January 31, 2025.\nAggregate Future Maturities \nThe following table presents the aggregate future maturities of the Company’s debt as of January 31, 2025, excluding associated carrying value adjustments, for the periods indicated:\nJanuary 31, 2025\n(in millions)\nFiscal 2026\n$\n5,208\n \nFiscal 2027\n6,384\n \nFiscal 2028\n1,315\n \nFiscal 2029\n1,372\n \nFiscal 2030\n2,984\n \nThereafter\n7,525\n \nTotal maturities, principal amount\n$\n24,788\n \n110\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 8 — \nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES \nAs part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures, respectively.\nThe Company’s objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts used to hedge the exposures, thereby reducing volatility of earnings and protecting the fair values of assets and liabilities. The earnings effects of the derivative instruments are presented in the same line items on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the earnings effects of the hedged items. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the Company assesses hedge effectiveness both at the onset of the hedge and at regular intervals throughout the life of the instruments. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the Company assesses hedge effectiveness on qualifying instruments using the shortcut method whereby the hedges are considered perfectly effective at the onset of the hedge and over the life of the hedging relationship.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Hedge accounting is applied based upon the criteria established by accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The risk of loss associated with purchased options is limited to premium amounts paid for the option contracts. The risk of loss associated with forward contracts is equal to the exchange rate differential from the time the contract is entered into until the time it is settled. The majority of these contracts typically expire in \ntwelve months\n or less.\nDuring the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges related to foreign exchange contracts that had a material impact on the Company’s results of operations due to the probability that the forecasted cash flows would not occur.\nThe Company uses forward contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. These contracts generally expire in \nthree months\n or less, are considered economic hedges, and are not designated for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of these instruments represents a natural hedge as their gains and losses offset the changes in the underlying fair value of the monetary assets and liabilities due to movements in currency exchange rates.\nIn connection with DFS operations in Europe, forward contracts are used to hedge financing receivables denominated in foreign currencies other than Euro. These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within \nthree years\n or less.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows related to the interest rate payments on structured financing debt. The interest rate swaps economically convert the variable rate on the structured financing debt to a fixed interest rate to match the underlying fixed rate being received on fixed-term customer leases and loans. These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within \nfour years\n or less.\nInterest rate swaps are utilized to manage the interest rate risk, at a portfolio level, associated with DFS operations in Europe. The interest rate swaps economically convert the fixed rate on financing receivables to a one-month or three-month Euribor floating rate in order to match the floating rate nature of the banks’ funding pool. The Company also uses interest rate swaps to manage the cash flows related to interest payments on senior unsecured eurobonds. The interest rate swaps economically convert the fixed rate on the Company’s bonds to a floating rate to match the underlying lease repayments profile. These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and most expire within \nfive years\n or less. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Dell Bank senior unsecured eurobonds.\n111\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe Company utilizes cross-currency amortizing swaps to hedge the currency and interest rate risk exposure associated with the European securitization program. The cross-currency swaps combine a Euro-based interest rate swap with a British Pound or U.S. Dollar foreign exchange forward contract in which the Company pays a fixed or floating British Pound or U.S. Dollar amount and receives a fixed or floating amount in Euros linked to the one-month Euribor rate. The notional value of the swaps amortizes in line with the expected cash flows and run-off of the securitized assets. The swaps are not designated for hedge accounting and expire within \nfive years\n or less.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of outstanding derivative instruments as of the dates indicated:\n \nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\n \n(in

In electing to bypass the qualitative assessment, the Company proceeded directly to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test to measure the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit relative to its carrying amount, and to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. For the remaining reporting units, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. The qualitative assessment included consideration of the relevant events and circumstances affecting the reporting unit, including macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and trends in the public company market valuation, where applicable. Additionally, Secureworks’ entry into an agreement, pursuant to which Secureworks was acquired in an all-cash transaction for approximately $\n0.9\n billion, as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, provided a fair value indication that the Secureworks reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nManagement exercised significant judgment related to the above assessments, including the identification of goodwill reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to goodwill reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit. For the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit is generally estimated using a combination of public company multiples and discounted cash flow methodologies. The discounted cash flow and public company multiples methodologies require significant judgment, including estimation of future revenues, gross margins, and operating expenses, which are dependent on internal forecasts, current and anticipated economic conditions and trends, selection of market multiples through assessment of the reporting unit’s performance relative to peer competitors, the estimation of the long-term revenue growth rate and discount rate of the Company’s business, and the determination of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the goodwill reporting unit, potentially resulting in a non-cash impairment charge.\nThe fair value of the indefinite-lived trade names is generally estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. These methodologies require significant judgment, including the estimation of future revenue, the estimation of the long-term revenue growth rate of the Company’s business and the determination of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital and royalty rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, potentially resulting in a non-cash impairment charge.\nBased on the results of the annual impairment test performed during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, the fair values of each of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles exceeded their carrying values. No goodwill or indefinite-lived assets impairment test was performed during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 other than the Company’s annual impairment review and the assessment of Secureworks.\n116\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 10 — \nDEFERRED REVENUE \nDeferred revenue consists of support and deployment services, software maintenance, training, Software-as-a-Service, and undelivered hardware and professional services, consisting of installations and consulting engagements. Deferred revenue is recorded when the Company has invoiced or payments have been received for undelivered products or services where transfer of control has not occurred. Revenue is recognized as the Company’s performance obligations under the contract are completed.\nThe following table presents the changes in the Company’s deferred revenue for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\n(in millions)\nDeferred revenue:\nDeferred revenue at beginning of period\n$\n29,145\n \n$\n30,286\n \nRevenue deferrals\n18,135\n \n20,866\n \nRevenue recognized\n(\n21,179\n)\n(\n22,022\n)\nOther (a)\n(\n136\n)\n15\n \nDeferred revenue at end of period\n$\n25,965\n \n$\n29,145\n \nShort-term deferred revenue\n$\n13,673\n \n$\n15,318\n \nLong-term deferred revenue\n$\n12,292\n \n$\n13,827\n \n____________________\n(a)\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, Other represents the reclassification of Secureworks deferred revenue to liabilities held for sale. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the sale of Secureworks.\nRemaining Performance Obligations \n— Remaining performance obligations represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations not delivered, or partially undelivered, as of the end of the reporting period. Remaining performance obligations include deferred revenue plus unbilled amounts not yet recorded in deferred revenue. The value of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations as of January 31, 2025 was approximately $\n38\n billion. The Company expects to recognize approximately \n61\n% of remaining performance obligations as revenue in the next \ntwelve months\n, \n20\n% in the following \ntwelve months\n, and the remainder thereafter.\nThe aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations does not include amounts owed under cancelable contracts where there is no substantive termination penalty. The Company applied the practical expedient to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed.\nRemaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidation, adjustments for revenue that have not materialized, and adjustments for currency.\n117\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 11 — \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \nPurchase Obligations\nThe Company has contractual obligations to purchase goods or services, which specify significant terms (including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased), fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations are primarily related to commitments with suppliers and software maintenance and support services. As of January 31, 2025, such purchase obligations were $\n5.0\n billion for Fiscal 2026, $\n0.6\n billion for Fiscal 2027, and $\n0.9\n billion for Fiscal 2028 and thereafter.\nLegal Matters\nThe Company is involved in various claims, suits, assessments, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, including those identified below, consisting of matters involving consumer, antitrust, tax, intellectual property, and other issues on a global basis. \nThe Company accrues a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. The Company reviews these accruals at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company’s views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations, or legal proceedings change, changes in the Company’s accrued liabilities are recorded in the period in which such a determination is made. For some matters, the incurrence of a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore accruals have not been made. \nThe following is a discussion of the Company’s significant legal matters and other proceedings:\nClass Actions Related to the Class V Transaction \n— On December 28, 2018, the Company completed a transaction (the “Class V transaction”) in which it paid $\n14.0\n billion in cash and issued \n149,387,617\n shares of its Class C Common Stock to holders of its Class V Common Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock. As a result of the Class V transaction, the tracking stock feature of the Company’s capital structure associated with the Class V Common Stock was terminated. Certain stockholders of the Company subsequently brought class action complaints arising out of the Class V transaction in which they named as defendants (collectively, the “defendants”) Michael S. Dell and certain other directors serving on the Company’s board of directors at the time of the Class V transaction (collectively, the “director defendants”), certain stockholders of the Company, consisting of Mr. Dell and Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. and certain of its affiliated funds (collectively, the “stockholder defendants”), and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, which served as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the transaction. The plaintiffs generally alleged that the director defendants and the stockholder defendants breached their fiduciary duties under Delaware law to the former holders of the Class V Common Stock in connection with the Class V transaction by offering a transaction value that was allegedly billions of dollars below fair value. \nAs previously reported, during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended February 3, 2023, the plaintiffs and the defendants entered into an agreement to settle the lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to the dismissal of all claims upon payment of a total of $\n1.0\n billion (the “settlement amount”), which included all costs, expenses and fees of the plaintiff class relating to the action and its resolution. On May 16, 2023, during the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024, the Company paid the settlement amount following approval of the settlement by the Delaware Court of Chancery. This matter is no longer material to the Company.\n118\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nR2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation \n— In November 2022, R2 Semiconductor, Inc. (“R2”) filed a lawsuit in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany against Intel Deutschland GmbH, Dell GmbH, and certain other customers of Intel Corporation. R2 asserted that \none\n European patent is infringed by certain Intel processors and those of the Company’s products that incorporate those processors. R2 sought an injunction prohibiting the sale of the allegedly infringing products and damages for the alleged infringement. The court conducted a trial on December 7, 2023 and, on February 7, 2024, issued a decision in favor of R2 and imposed an injunction prohibiting the sale and use of such products in Germany by Dell GmbH, and requiring Dell GmbH to issue a communication to certain customers recalling the covered products sold since March 5, 2020. On February 8, 2024, the Company filed an appeal. In April and May 2024, R2 filed lawsuits in Paris, France and Milan, Italy, against affiliates of Intel Corporation (“Intel”) and of the Company, raising similar allegations. Intel agreed to defend the foregoing actions and indemnify the Company and its affiliates against certain losses incurred by the Company in connection with R2’s claims. On August 30, 2024, Intel and R2 publicly announced an agreement to dismiss all litigation between the two companies that would include dismissal of all litigation against all subsidiaries of Dell Technologies named in the foregoing actions. Pursuant to that agreement, the Italian lawsuit was dismissed on September 2, 2024, the German lawsuit was dismissed on September 4, 2024, and the French lawsuit was dismissed on September 6, 2024.\nOther Litigation\n — Dell does not currently anticipate that any of the other legal proceedings it is involved in will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, the Company provides disclosures of matters where it is at least reasonably possible that the Company could experience a material loss exceeding the amounts already accrued for these or other proceedings or matters. In addition, the Company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the industry, and investor, customer, and employee relations considerations. As of January 31, 2025, the Company does not believe there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss exceeding the amounts already accrued for these or other proceedings or matters has been incurred. However, since the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings and matters is inherently unpredictable, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period by unfavorable outcomes in one or more of these proceedings or matters. Whether the outcome of any claim, suit, assessment, investigation, or legal proceeding, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows will depend on a number of factors, including the nature, timing, and amount of any associated expenses, amounts paid in settlement, damages, or other remedies or consequences.\nIndemnifications Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into various contracts under which it may agree to indemnify other parties for losses incurred from certain events as defined in the relevant contract, such as litigation, regulatory penalties, or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments related to these indemnification obligations have not been material to the Company.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into with VMware, Inc. upon completion of the spin-off of VMware, Inc. on November 1, 2021 (the “VMware Spin-off”), Dell Technologies agreed to indemnify VMware, Inc., each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, as well as any successors and assigns of the foregoing, from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to Dell Technologies as part of the separation of Dell Technologies and VMware, Inc. (currently operating under the name VMware LLC, and individually and together with its subsidiaries, “VMware”) and their respective businesses (the “Separation”). VMware similarly agreed to indemnify Dell Technologies Inc., each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers, and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to VMware as part of the Separation. The amounts that VMware and Dell Technologies may be obligated to pay each other could vary depending on the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years. Net income tax indemnification receivables from VMware were immaterial as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024.\n119\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nCertain Concentrations\nThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, derivatives, and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions that potentially subject it to concentration of credit risk. As part of its risk management processes, the Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. The Company has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. Further, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.\nThe Company markets and sells its products and services to large corporate clients, governmental agencies, and health care and education accounts, as well as to small and medium-sized businesses and individuals. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated net revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023.\nThe Company utilizes a limited number of contract manufacturers that assemble a portion of its products. The Company purchases components from suppliers and sells those components to such contract manufacturers. The Company reflects the sale of such components by recognizing non-trade receivables from the contract manufacturers and a reduction in inventory when title and risk of loss pass to the manufacturer. Cash flows related to such transactions are recorded within cash flows from operating activities. The Company does not reflect the sale of the components in revenue and does not recognize any profit on the component sales until the related products are sold to a customer.\nThe agreements with the majority of the contract manufacturers permit the Company to offset its payables against the receivables, thus mitigating the credit risk wholly or in part. Such receivables were $\n5.4\n billion and $\n3.4\n billion as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, respectively, and primarily consisted of receivables from the Company’s three largest contract manufacturers. The Company offset its corresponding payables against $\n4.7\n billion and $\n2.7\n billion of such receivables as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, respectively. The portion of receivables not offset is included in other current assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n \n120\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 12 — \nINCOME AND OTHER TAXES\nThe following table presents components of the income tax expense (benefit) recognized for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions)\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n(\n84\n)\n$\n161\n \n$\n605\n \nState/local\n(\n21\n)\n33\n \n176\n \nForeign\n785\n \n612\n \n739\n \nCurrent\n680\n \n806\n \n1,520\n \nDeferred:\nFederal\n(\n220\n)\n(\n106\n)\n(\n483\n)\nState/local\n(\n12\n)\n(\n42\n)\n(\n103\n)\nForeign\n24\n \n57\n \n(\n131\n)\nDeferred\n(\n208\n)\n(\n91\n)\n(\n717\n)\nIncome tax expense\n$\n472\n \n$\n715\n \n$\n803\n \nThe following table presents components of income (loss) before income taxes for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions)\nDomestic\n$\n(\n73\n)\n$\n(\n52\n)\n$\n(\n1,316\n)\nForeign\n5,121\n \n4,139\n \n4,541\n \nIncome before income taxes\n$\n5,048\n \n$\n4,087\n \n$\n3,225\n \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s effective tax rate to the statutory U.S. federal tax rate for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\nU.S. federal statutory rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nState income taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n1.4\n \n(\n0.2\n)\n2.0\n \nTax impact of foreign operations\n0.6\n \n2.1\n \n(\n0.8\n)\nChange in valuation allowance\n1.1\n \n0.3\n \n0.4\n \nNon-deductible transaction-related costs\n0.1\n \n—\n \n0.8\n \nStock-based compensation expense\n(\n4.0\n)\n(\n0.9\n)\n(\n2.4\n)\nU.S. R&D tax credits\n(\n1.7\n)\n(\n4.3\n)\n(\n2.6\n)\nLapse of U.S. statutes of limitations\n(\n8.5\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nClass V transaction litigation settlement\n—\n \n—\n \n5.8\n \nOther\n(\n0.6\n)\n(\n0.5\n)\n0.7\n \nTotal\n9.4\n \n%\n17.5\n \n%\n24.9\n \n%\n121\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nChanges related to the Company’s effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023 were primarily attributable to discrete tax items and a change in the Company’s jurisdictional mix of income related to the tax impact of foreign operations and benefits from U.S. research and development tax credits. The Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 included discrete tax benefits of $\n0.4\n billion related to the expiration of certain U.S. statutes of limitations and $\n0.2\n billion related to stock-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2023 included the impact of a $\n0.9\n billion expense recognized in connection with the agreement to settle the Class V transaction litigation described in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe differences between the effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% principally result from the geographical distribution of income, differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items, and discrete tax items. In certain jurisdictions, the Company’s tax rate is significantly lower than the applicable statutory rate as a result of tax holidays. The majority of the Company’s foreign income subject to these tax holidays and lower tax rates is attributable to Singapore and China. Starting in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, the benefits of these tax holidays were limited by the impact of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Pillar Two global minimum tax. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023, the income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of the affected subsidiaries were immaterial to the Company’s provision for income taxes and earnings per share.\nAs of January 31, 2025, the Company has undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $\n36.9\n billion that remain indefinitely reinvested, and as such has not recognized a deferred tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable. The Company believes that a significant portion of the Company’s undistributed earnings as of January 31, 2025 will not be subject to further U.S. federal taxation.\nThe following table presents the components of the Company’s net deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of the dates indicated:\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\n(in millions)\nDeferred tax assets:\nDeferred revenue and warranty provisions\n$\n1,769\n \n$\n1,878\n \nCredit carryforwards\n670\n \n554\n \nLoss carryforwards\n697\n \n619\n \nOperating and compensation related accruals\n482\n \n478\n \nCapitalized research and development\n291\n \n302\n \nOther\n256\n \n320\n \nDeferred tax assets (a)\n4,165\n \n4,151\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n1,368\n)\n(\n1,232\n)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n2,797\n \n2,919\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nLeasing and financing\n(\n285\n)\n(\n397\n)\nProperty and equipment\n(\n273\n)\n(\n377\n)\nIntangibles\n(\n240\n)\n(\n338\n)\nOther\n(\n393\n)\n(\n375\n)\nDeferred tax liabilities (a)\n(\n1,191\n)\n(\n1,487\n)\nNet deferred tax assets\n$\n1,606\n \n$\n1,432\n \n____________________\n(a)\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are included in other non-current assets and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n122\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe following tables present the net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets with related valuation allowances recognized as of the dates indicated:\nJanuary 31, 2025\nDeferred Tax Assets\nValuation Allowance\nNet Deferred Tax Assets\nFirst Year Expiring\n(in millions)\nCredit carryforwards\n$\n670\n \n$\n(\n664\n)\n$\n6\n \nFiscal 2026\nLoss carryforwards\n697\n \n(\n484\n)\n213\n \nFiscal 2026\nOther deferred tax assets\n2,798\n \n(\n220\n)\n2,578\n \nNA\nTotal \n$\n4,165\n \n$\n(\n1,368\n)\n$\n2,797\n \nFebruary 2, 2024\nDeferred Tax Assets\nValuation Allowance\nNet Deferred Tax Assets\nFirst Year Expiring\n(in millions)\nCredit carryforwards\n$\n554\n \n$\n(\n549\n)\n$\n5\n \nFiscal 2025\nLoss carryforwards\n619\n \n(\n405\n)\n214\n \nFiscal 2025\nOther deferred tax assets\n2,978\n \n(\n278\n)\n2,700\n \nNA\nTotal \n$\n4,151\n \n$\n(\n1,232\n)\n$\n2,919\n \nThe Company’s credit carryforwards as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024 relate primarily to U.S. tax credits and include state tax credits associated with research and development, as well as foreign tax credits associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company assessed the realizability of these U.S. tax credits and has recorded a valuation allowance against the credits it does not expect to utilize. The Company’s loss carryforwards as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024 include net operating loss carryforwards from federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions. The valuation allowances for other deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024 primarily relate to foreign jurisdictions, the changes in which are included in the tax impact of foreign operations in the Company’s effective tax reconciliation.

The table also does not include certain tax benefits associated with interest and state tax deductions and other indirect jurisdictional effects of uncertain tax positions, which were $\n1.3\n billion, $\n1.4\n billion, and $\n0.9\n billion as of January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023, respectively. \nAfter taking these items into account, the Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits were $\n0.9\n billion as of January 31, 2025 and $\n1.3\n billion as of February 2, 2024 and February 3, 2023, and are included in other non-current liabilities i\nn the \nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position\n.\nThe unrecognized tax benefits in the table above include $\n0.9\n billion, $\n1.2\n billion, and $\n1.1\n billion as of January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023, respectively, that, if recognized, would have impacted income tax expense. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense. The impact of interest and penalties on the Company’s tax provision was immaterial for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023.\nIn June 2023, the Company received a Revenue Agent’s Report for the federal income tax examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) of fiscal years 2018 through 2019. The IRS proposed adjustments primarily relating to certain transactions the Company completed as part of its business integration efforts. In August 2023, the Company submitted a written protest to the IRS relating to certain assessments. The Company received a rebuttal from the IRS to its written protest in April 2024. The Company disagrees with the IRS’s proposed adjustments and will contest them through the IRS administrative appeals procedures. The Company anticipates that the appeals process for the resolution of these matters will extend beyond the next twelve months. The IRS is also currently conducting a federal income tax examination of fiscal years 2020 through 2022.\nThe Company is also currently under income tax audits in various U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions. The Company is undergoing negotiations, and in some cases contested proceedings, relating to tax matters with the taxing authorities in these jurisdictions. With respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the Company is generally not subject to tax examinations for years prior to the fiscal year ended February 2, 2018. The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves related to all matters contained in tax periods open to examination, including the IRS audits described above. Although the Company believes it has made adequate provisions for the uncertainties with respect to these audits, should the Company experience unfavorable outcomes, such outcomes could have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nJudgment is required in evaluating the Company’s uncertain tax positions and determining the Company’s provision for income taxes. The Company does not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. \n124\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe Company takes certain non-income tax positions in the jurisdictions in which it operates and has received certain non-income tax assessments from various jurisdictions. The Company believes that a material loss in these matters is not probable and that it is not reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding amounts already accrued has been incurred. The Company believes its positions in these non-income tax litigation matters are supportable and that it ultimately will prevail in the matters. In the normal course of business, the Company’s positions and conclusions related to its non-income taxes could be challenged and assessments may be made. To the extent new information is obtained and the Company’s views on its positions, probable outcomes of assessments, or litigation change, changes in estimates to the Company’s accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such a determination is made. In the resolution process for income tax and non-income tax audits, the Company is required in certain situations to provide collateral guarantees or indemnification to regulators and tax authorities until the matter is resolved.\n125\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 13 — \nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is presented in stockholders’ equity (deficit) in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and consists of amounts related to foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized net gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, and actuarial net gains (losses) from pension and other postretirement plans.\nThe following table presents changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, by the following components as of the dates indicated:\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments\nCash Flow Hedges\nPension and Other Postretirement Plans\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n(in millions)\nBalances as of January 28, 2022\n$\n(\n526\n)\n$\n129\n \n$\n(\n34\n)\n$\n(\n431\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n(\n222\n)\n354\n \n1\n \n133\n \nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n—\n \n(\n705\n)\n1\n \n(\n704\n)\nTotal change for the period\n(\n222\n)\n(\n351\n)\n2\n \n(\n571\n)\nLess: Change in comprehensive loss attributable to non-controlling interests\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nBalances as of February 3, 2023\n$\n(\n747\n)\n$\n(\n222\n)\n$\n(\n32\n)\n$\n(\n1,001\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n(\n8\n)\n85\n \n15\n \n92\n \nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n—\n \n107\n \n2\n \n109\n \nTotal change for the period\n(\n8\n)\n192\n \n17\n \n201\n \nBalances as of February 2, 2024\n$\n(\n755\n)\n$\n(\n30\n)\n$\n(\n15\n)\n$\n(\n800\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n(\n268\n)\n246\n \n—\n \n(\n22\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n—\n \n(\n111\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n117\n)\nTotal change for the period\n(\n268\n)\n135\n \n(\n6\n)\n(\n139\n)\nBalances as of January 31, 2025\n$\n(\n1,023\n)\n$\n105\n \n$\n(\n21\n)\n$\n(\n939\n)\nAmounts related to the Company’s cash flow hedges are reclassified to net income during the same period in which the items being hedged are recognized in earnings.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive instruments.

Stock-Based Compensation Plan\nDell Technologies Inc. 2023 Stock Incentive Plan \n—\n \nEmployees, consultants, non-employee directors, and other service providers of the Company or its affiliates are eligible to participate in the Dell Technologies Inc. 2023 Stock Incentive Plan, which became effective on June 20, 2023 upon its approval by stockholders (the “2023 Plan”). The 2023 Plan authorizes the Company to grant stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards, deferred stock units, and dividend equivalents. The 2023 Plan replaced the Dell Technologies Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the “2013 Plan”). Upon effectiveness of the 2023 Plan, no further awards were authorized for grant under the 2013 Plan. \nThe 2023 Plan authorizes the issuance of an aggregate of up to approximately \n103.3\n million shares of the Class C Common Stock, including (a) \n50.0\n million shares of Class C Common Stock that were authorized for offering and issuance under the 2023 Plan, (b) approximately \n7.0\n million shares of Class C Common Stock that remained available for issuance under the 2013 Plan as of the effective date of the 2023 Plan, and (c) up to approximately \n46.3\n million shares of Class C Common Stock subject to awards outstanding under the 2013 Plan as of the effective date of the 2023 Plan that subsequently expire or terminate prior to exercise or settlement. As of January 31, 2025, there were approximately \n54\n million shares of Class C Common Stock available for future grants under the 2023 Plan.\nRestricted Stock \n— The Company’s awards primarily consist of RSUs granted to employees. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023, the Company granted long-term incentive awards in the form of service-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) in order to align critical talent retention programs with the interests of holders of the Class C Common Stock.\nService-based RSUs have a fair value based on the closing price of the Class C Common Stock price as reported on the NYSE on the grant date or the trade day immediately preceding the grant date, if the grant date falls on a non-trading day. The majority of such RSUs vest ratably over a \nthree-year\n period. Each service-based RSU represents the right to acquire \none\n share of Class C Common Stock upon vesting. \nThe PSUs granted during the periods presented are reflected as target units for performance periods not yet complete. The actual number of units that ultimately vest will range from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of target, based on the level of achievement of the performance goals and continued employment with the Company over a \nthree-year\n performance period. Approximately half of the PSUs granted are subject to achievement of market-based performance goals based on relative total shareholder return and were valued utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model to simulate the probabilities of achievement. The remaining PSUs are subject to internal financial measures and have fair values based on the closing price of the Class C Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on the accounting grant date. \n131\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nBeginning with grants made during the fiscal year ended February 3, 2023, dividend equivalents accrue on outstanding RSUs and PSUs when a dividend is paid to the Company’s common stockholders.

For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023, \n5.0\n million, \n9.0\n million, and \n8.0\n million shares, respectively, were withheld to cover $\n568\n million, $\n366\n million, and $\n388\n million, respectively, of employees’ tax obligations. The value of the withheld shares was classified as a reduction to common stock and capital in excess of par value.\nStock Option Activity \n— In addition to RSU activity, the Company also had stock option activity which was not material during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023. Stock options are granted with option exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Class C Common Stock and expire \nten years\n after the grant date.\nOther Plans\nIn addition to the 2023 Plan described above, the Company’s consolidated subsidiary, Secureworks, maintains its own equity plan and issues equity grants settling in its Class A common stock. The stock option and restricted stock unit activity under this plan was not material to the Company during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023.\n \n133\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 17 — \nRETIREMENT PLAN BENEFITS \nDefined Benefit Retirement Plans\nThe Company sponsors retirement plans for certain employees, some of which meet the criteria of a defined benefit retirement plan. Benefits under defined benefit retirement plans guarantee a particular payment to the employee in retirement. The amount of retirement benefit is defined by the plan and is typically a function of the number of years of service rendered by the employee and the employee’s average salary or salary at retirement. The annual costs of the plans are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method that includes actuarial assumptions and estimates which are subject to change. \nU.S. Pension Plan\n — The Company sponsored a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan in the United States (the “U.S. pension plan”), which was assumed in connection with the EMC merger transaction that was completed in September 2016. As of December 1999, the U.S. pension plan was frozen, so employees no longer accrue retirement benefits for future services. \nOn August 20, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to terminate the U.S. pension plan with an effective date of September 30, 2024. The Company is transitioning the U.S. pension plan to a qualified insurance company and expects settlement in \n12\n to \n18\n months from the termination effective date. The Company does not expect the settlement of the U.S. pension plan obligations to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe measurement date for the U.S. pension plan is the end of the Company’s fiscal year. The Company did not make any material contributions to the U.S. pension plan for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023. Net periodic benefit costs related to the U.S. pension plan were immaterial for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023. \nThe following table presents attributes of the U.S. pension plan as of the dates indicated:\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\n(in millions)\nPlan assets at fair value (a)\n$\n423\n \n$\n440\n \nBenefit obligations\n(\n437\n)\n(\n457\n)\nUnderfunded position (b)\n$\n(\n14\n)\n$\n(\n17\n)\n____________________\n(a)\nPlan assets are managed by outside investment managers.

The Company’s investment strategy with respect to plan assets is to achieve a long-term growth of capital, consistent with an appropriate level of risk. Assets are recognized at fair value and are primarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 and were primarily classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024.\n(b)\nThe underfunded position is recognized in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n \nDefined Contribution Retirement Plans\nDell 401(k) Plan \n— The Company maintains a defined contribution retirement plan (the “Dell 401(k) Plan”) that complies with Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Only U.S. employees and employees of certain subsidiaries, except those who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, classified as a leased employee or a nonresident alien, or are covered under a separate plan, are eligible to participate in the Dell 401(k) Plan. Participation in the Dell 401(k) Plan is at the election of the employee. As of January 31, 2025, the Company matched \n100\n% of each participant’s voluntary contributions (the “Dell 401(k) employer match”), subject to a maximum contribution of \n6\n% of the participant’s eligible compensation, up to an annual limit of $\n7,500\n. Participants vest immediately in all contributions to the Dell 401(k) Plan. The Company’s matching contributions as well as participants’ voluntary contributions are invested according to each participant’s elections in the investment options provided under the Dell 401(k) Plan. The Company’s contributions during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023 were $\n218\n million, $\n238\n million, and $\n263\n million, respectively.\n \n135\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 18 — \nSEGMENT INFORMATION \nThe Company reports its financial results through \ntwo\n reportable segments which are based on the following business units: Infrastructure Solutions Group (“ISG”) and Client Solutions Group (“CSG”). The Company organizes its reportable segments based on the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company. \nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The CODM is regularly provided and reviews segment revenue and segment operating income to assess the performance of each segment and allocate resources to the segments in the annual planning process. The Company’s measure of segment revenue and segment operating income for management reporting purposes excludes Corporate and other, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and other corporate expenses, as applicable, which are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, the segments. The Company does not allocate assets to the above reportable segments for internal reporting purposes. Additionally, the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nISG includes the Company’s servers and networking offerings and storage offerings. The Company’s server portfolio includes high-performance general-purpose and AI-optimized servers. The Company’s networking portfolio includes wide area network infrastructure, data center and edge networking switches, and cables and optics. The Company’s comprehensive storage portfolio includes modern and traditional storage solutions, including all-flash arrays, scale-out file, object platforms, hyper-converged infrastructure, and software-defined storage. ISG also offers software, peripherals, and services, including consulting and support and deployment.\nCSG includes the Company’s commercial offerings and consumer offerings. The Company’s CSG portfolio includes branded PCs, including notebooks, desktops, and workstations and branded peripherals that include displays, docking stations, keyboards, mice, and webcam and audio devices, as well as third-party software and peripherals. CSG also includes services offerings, such as configuration, support and deployment, and extended warranties. \nFollowing its acquisition by Broadcom on November 22, 2023, VMware announced changes to its go-to-market approach for VMware offerings that impacted the Company’s commercial relationship with VMware. On March 25, 2024, the Company terminated the Commercial Framework Agreement with VMware, which provided the framework pursuant to which the Company and VMware continued the commercial relationship following the VMware Spin-off described in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under which Dell Technologies acted as a distributor of Broadcom’s VMware stand-alone products and services and purchased such products and services for resale to end-user customers (“VMware Resale”). Dell Technologies no longer acts as a distributor of VMware’s standalone products and services, although the Company will continue to support customers that have purchased resale offerings sold in prior periods. The results of VMware Resale transactions are reflected in Corporate and other. The Company continues to integrate and embed certain VMware products and services with select Dell Technologies’ offerings to end-users. The results of such offerings are reflected within CSG or ISG, depending upon the nature of the underlying offering sold.\n136\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net revenue by the Company’s reportable segments to the Company’s consolidated net revenue as well as a reconciliation of segment operating income to the Company’s consolidated operating income for the periods indicated:\n \nFiscal Year Ended\n \nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\n \n(in millions)\nConsolidated net revenue:\n \n \nInfrastructure Solutions Group\n$\n43,593\n \n$\n33,885\n \n$\n38,356\n \nClient Solutions Group\n48,393\n \n48,916\n \n58,213\n \nReportable segment net revenue\n91,986\n \n82,801\n \n96,569\n \nCorporate and other (a)\n3,581\n \n5,624\n \n5,732\n \nTotal consolidated net revenue\n$\n95,567\n \n$\n88,425\n \n$\n102,301\n \nConsolidated operating income:\nInfrastructure Solutions Group\n$\n5,579\n \n$\n4,286\n \n$\n5,045\n \nClient Solutions Group\n2,972\n \n3,712\n \n3,824\n \nReportable segment operating income (b)\n8,551\n \n7,998\n \n8,869\n \nCorporate and other (a)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n120\n)\n(\n232\n)\nAmortization of intangibles (c)\n(\n667\n)\n(\n833\n)\n(\n1,014\n)\nStock-based compensation expense (d)\n(\n785\n)\n(\n878\n)\n(\n931\n)\nOther corporate expenses (e)\n(\n840\n)\n(\n756\n)\n(\n921\n)\nTotal consolidated operating income (f)\n$\n6,237\n \n$\n5,411\n \n$\n5,771\n \n____________________\n(a)\nCorporate and other consists of results of divested businesses or non-reportable segments whose offerings are no longer actively sold, including (i) VMware Resale, (ii) Secureworks, and (iii) Virtustream, and do not meet the requirements for a reportable segment, either individually or collectively.

(“Broadcom”), VMware was considered a related party of the Company. Upon Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware, Michael Dell’s ownership interest in VMware and his position as Chairman of the Board of VMware terminated, and the Company determined no related party relationship exists with Broadcom or VMware effective as of November 22, 2023. The Company continues to engage in select transactions with VMware following the completion of Broadcom’s acquisition and the termination of the related party relationship. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nRelated Party Transactions with VMware\nThe information provided below includes a summary of related party transactions with VMware for the periods presented within this report. Such transactions were considered related party transactions only through November 21, 2023, the day immediately preceding Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. \n•\nDell Technologies integrated or bundled select VMware products and services with Dell Technologies’ products and sold them to end-users. Dell Technologies also acted as a distributor, purchasing VMware’s standalone products and services for resale to end-user customers. Where applicable, costs under these arrangements were presented net of rebates received by Dell Technologies. \n•\nDFS provided financing to certain VMware end-users, which resulted in the recognition of amounts due to related parties on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Associated financing fees were recorded to product net revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and were reflected within sales and leases of products to VMware in the table below.\n•\nDell Technologies procured products and services from VMware for its internal use. For the fiscal years ended February 2, 2024 and February 3, 2023, costs incurred associated with products and services purchased from VMware for internal use were immaterial. \n•\nDell Technologies sold and leased products and sold services to VMware. For the fiscal years ended February 2, 2024 and February 3, 2023, revenue recognized from sales of services to VMware was immaterial.\n•\nDell Technologies and VMware entered into joint marketing, sales, and branding arrangements, for which both parties incurred costs. For the fiscal years ended February 2, 2024 and February 3, 2023, consideration received from VMware for joint marketing, sales, and branding arrangements was immaterial.\n•\nDell Technologies and VMware entered into a transition services agreement in connection with the VMware Spin-off to provide various support services, including investment advisory services, certain support services from Dell Technologies personnel, and other transitional services. Costs incurred associated with this agreement were immaterial for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2023.

The Company has no involvement in establishing the terms or conditions of the arrangement between its suppliers and the financial institution, no economic interest in a supplier's decision to sell a receivable, and does not provide legally secured assets or other forms of guarantees under the arrangement. \nThe SCF Program does not impact the Company's liquidity as payments for participating supplier invoices are remitted by the Company to the financial institution on the original invoice due date, regardless of whether an individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution. Further, the Company negotiates payment terms with suppliers regardless of their decision to participate in the SCF Program. Payment terms with such suppliers vary and do not exceed \n130\n days. The Company’s outstanding obligations represent invoices due to suppliers confirmed as valid under the SCF Program and are included within accounts payable on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, while associated payments are included in cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe following table presents the changes in the Company’s outstanding obligations for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\n(in millions)\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the beginning of period\n$\n1,121\n \nInvoices confirmed\n5,191\n \nConfirmed invoices paid\n(\n4,944\n)\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the end of period\n$\n1,368\n \nInterest and other, net\nThe following table presents information regarding interest and other, net as included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended\nJanuary 31, 2025\nFebruary 2, 2024\nFebruary 3, 2023\n(in millions)\nInterest and other, net:\nInvestment income, primarily interest\n$\n160\n \n$\n305\n \n$\n100\n \nGain (loss) on investments, net\n177\n \n47\n \n(\n206\n)\nInterest expense\n(\n1,394\n)\n(\n1,501\n)\n(\n1,222\n)\nForeign exchange\n(\n112\n)\n(\n199\n)\n(\n265\n)\nLegal settlement, net\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n894\n)\nOther\n(\n20\n)\n24\n \n(\n59\n)\nTotal interest and other, net\n$\n(\n1,189\n)\n$\n(\n1,324\n)\n$\n(\n2,546\n)\n144\nTable of Contents\nDELL TECHNOLOGIES INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 21 — \nGOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE\nThe Company receives government assistance in the form of grants and incentives which vary in size, duration, and conditions from various domestic and international governing bodies and related entities which are primarily structured as cash grants and non-income tax incentives. For government assistance in which no specific US GAAP applies, the Company accounts for such transactions as a gain contingency and by analogy to a grant model. Under such model, the Company recognizes the impact of the government assistance on the Consolidated Statements of Income upon reaching reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions of the assistance and that the grant will be received. The Company classifies the impact of government assistance on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on the underlying nature and purpose of the assistance. \nDuring the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023, government assistance received primarily consisted of the following:\nThe Company received assistance from foreign governmental entities designed, in part, to promote competitive pricing by providing companies with an offset to local sales taxes incurred on the sales of products to customers. The assistance received is broadly available to companies. To qualify for this assistance, companies are required to invest a portion of local revenue, derived from goods manufactured locally, into research and development activities. The incentives in place are currently set to expire at various dates through 2029. Such expirations could be impacted by future legislation. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024, and February 3, 2023, the Company recognized $\n279\n million, $\n288\n million, and $\n297\n million, respectively, within \nnet revenue\n on the Consolidated Statements of Income related to such assistance.\nThe Company received incentives from foreign governmental entities to provide reimbursement for various costs incurred that are directly tied to the production or delivery of offerings sold to customers.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNOTE 23 — \nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS \nThere were no known events occurring after January 31, 2025, and up until the date of issuance of this report that would materially affect the information presented herein.\n150\nITEM 9 — CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A\n \n— CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThis report includes the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Rule 13a-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 filed with this report. This Item 9A includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in those certifications.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nIn connection with the preparation of this report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2025. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of January 31, 2025, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures which (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorization of management and the directors of the issuer, and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nDuring the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, management identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as the Company did not design and maintain effective controls over non-recurring credits from certain suppliers that related to cost of net revenue. This material weakness resulted in the revision of the Company’s annual Consolidated Financial Statements previously issued for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2024 and the unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements previously issued for Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 interim periods. While the impacts were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s previously issued Consolidated Financial Statements, the material weakness related to non-recurring credits from certain suppliers could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim Consolidated Financial Statements that would not be prevented or detected until such material weakness is remediated.\n151\nIn connection with the preparation of this report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on the criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As a result of the material weakness described above, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of January 31, 2025. \nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in “Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nRemediation of Material Weakness\nThe Company is committed to addressing the material weakness described above and has begun to implement changes in processes designed to improve its internal control over financial reporting. To remediate the material weakness, we are designing and implementing a new control over non-recurring credits from certain suppliers.\nAs the Company evaluates and enhances its internal control over financial reporting, it may take additional measures to modify, or add to, the remediation measures described above. Remediation will not occur until the plans are implemented and there has been appropriate time to conclude through testing that the controls operate effectively.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe are in the process of an ongoing business modernization initiative to advance our capabilities, leverage new technology, and optimize business processes to change the way we work and make decisions, improve business outcomes, and reduce costs. As part of this initiative, we are modernizing accounting and finance systems. We have modified and will continue to modify the design and implementation of certain internal control processes to accommodate changes to our business processes and finance procedures, as our business modernization initiative continues.\nThere were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nOur system of controls is designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability and integrity of accounting and financial reporting. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. These inherent limitations include the following:\n•\nJudgments in decision-making can be faulty, and control and process breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.\n•\nControls can be circumvented by individuals, acting alone or in collusion with each other, or by management override.\n•\nThe design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\n•\nOver time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures.\n•\nThe design of a control system must reflect the fact that resources are constrained, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\n152\nITEM 9B — OTHER INFORMATION\nTrading Arrangements\nOn \nJanuary 13, 2025\n, \nWilliam Green\n, one of the Company’s \ndirectors\n, \nadopted\n a written plan for the sale of up to \n272,736\n shares of the Company’s Class C Common Stock that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The plan will expire on \nDecember 31, 2025\n, or on any earlier date on which all of the shares have been sold.\nITEM 9C — DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\nPART III\nITEM 10 — DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nWe have adopted a code of ethics applicable to our principal executive officer and our other senior financial officers. The code of ethics, which we refer to as our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, is available on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.delltechnologies.com. To the extent required by SEC rules, we intend to disclose any amendments to this code and any waiver of a provision of the code for the benefit of any senior financial officers on our website within any period that may be required under SEC rules from time to time.\nSee “Part I — Item 1 — Business — Information about our Executive Officers” for more information about our executive officers, which is incorporated by reference in this Item 10. Other information required by this Item 10 is incorporated herein by reference to our definitive proxy statement for our 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, referred to as the “2025 proxy statement,” which we will file with the SEC on or before 120 days after our 2025 fiscal year-end, and which will appear in the 2025 proxy statement under the captions “Proposal 1 — Election of Directors,” “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” and “Additional Information — Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports,” if applicable.\nThe following information about the members of our Board of Directors and the principal occupation or employment of each director is provided as of the date of this report.\nMichael S.
