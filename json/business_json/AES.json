In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased. However, in a few instances, no accompanying project financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate.\n75 | 2024 Annual Report\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS \nThe Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company has accrued for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes, based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for estimated liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. It is reasonably possible, however, that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of December 31, 2024. Pursuant to SEC amendments Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K, AES’ policy is to disclose environmental legal proceedings to which a governmental authority is a party if such proceedings are reasonably expected to result in monetary sanctions of greater than or equal to $1 million.\nIn December 2001, Grid Corporation of Odisha (“GRIDCO”) served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limited (“AES ODPL”), and Jyoti Structures (“Jyoti”) pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement between GRIDCO, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (“CESCO”), an affiliate of the Company. In the arbitration, GRIDCO asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Company's indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCO's financial obligations to GRIDCO. GRIDCO appeared to be seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus undisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by GRIDCO. The Company counterclaimed against GRIDCO for damages. In June 2007, a 2-to-1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting GRIDCO's claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to GRIDCO. The respondents' counterclaims were also rejected. A majority of the tribunal later awarded the respondents, including the Company, some of their costs relating to the arbitration. GRIDCO filed challenges of the tribunal's awards with the local Indian court. GRIDCO's challenge of the costs award has been dismissed by the court, but its challenge of the liability award remains pending. A hearing on the liability award has not taken place to date. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\nPursuant to their environmental audit, AES Sul and AES Florestal discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at a pole factory that AES Florestal had been operating. The conclusion of the audit was that a prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia (“CEEE”), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. On their initiative, AES Sul and AES Florestal communicated with Brazilian authorities and CEEE about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. In March 2008, the State Attorney of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil filed a public civil action against AES Sul, AES Florestal and CEEE seeking an order requiring the companies to mitigate the contaminated area located on the grounds of the pole factory and an indemnity payment of approximately R$6 million ($1 million). In October 2011, the State Attorney filed a request for an injunction ordering the defendant companies to contain and remove the contamination immediately. The court granted injunctive relief on October 18, 2011, but determined that only CEEE was required to perform the removal work. In May 2012, CEEE began the removal work in compliance with the injunction. The case is now awaiting judgment. The removal and remediation costs are estimated to be approximately R$\n15\n million to R$\n60\n million ($\n2\n million to $\n10\n million), and there could be additional costs which cannot be estimated at this time. In June 2016, the Company sold AES Sul to CPFL Energia S.A. and as part of the sale, AES Guaiba, a holding company of AES Sul, retained the potential liability relating to this matter. The Company believes that there are meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\nIn September 2015, AES Southland Development, LLC and AES Redondo Beach, LLC filed a lawsuit against the California Coastal Commission (the “CCC”) over the CCC's determination that the site of AES Redondo Beach included approximately 5.93 acres of CCC-jurisdictional wetlands. The CCC has asserted that AES Redondo Beach has improperly installed and operated water pumps affecting the alleged wetlands in violation of the California Coastal Act and Redondo Beach Local Coastal Program (“LCP”). Potential outcomes of the CCC determination could include an order requiring AES Redondo Beach to perform a restoration and/or pay fines or penalties. AES Redondo Beach believes that it has meritorious arguments concerning the underlying CCC determination, but there can be no assurances that it will be successful. On March 27, 2020, AES Redondo Beach, LLC sold the site to an unaffiliated third-party purchaser that assumed the obligations contained within these proceedings. On May 26, 2020, CCC staff sent AES an NOV directing AES to discontinue any operation of the water pumps in the alleged \n76 | 2024 Annual Report\nwetlands and to submit a Coastal Development Permit (“CDP”) application for the removal of the water pumps within the alleged wetlands. The NOV also directed AES to submit technical analysis regarding additional water pumps located within onsite electrical vaults and, if necessary, a CDP application for their continued operation. With respect to the vault pumps, AES provided the CCC, with the requested analysis, and the CCC has not required further action. With respect to the pumps in the alleged wetlands, AES locked out those pumps to prevent further operation and submitted the CDP to the permitting authority, the City of Redondo Beach (the “City”), with respect to AES’ plans to disable or remove the pumps. On October 14, 2020, the City deemed the CDP application to be complete and indicated a public hearing will be required. AES submitted all required information and waited for the City to continue processing the application. In December 2023, the City indicated it would continue processing the CDP application. AES will vigorously defend its interests with regard to the NOV, but we cannot predict the outcome of the matter at this time. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of Coastal Act and LCP claims alleged against other companies have required them to pay significant civil penalties and undertake remedial measures.\nIn October 2015, AES Indiana received an NOV alleging violations of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), the Indiana State Implementation Plan (“SIP”), and the Title V operating permit related to alleged particulate and opacity violations at Petersburg Station Unit 3. In addition, in February 2016, AES Indiana received an NOV from the EPA alleging violations of New Source Review and other CAA regulations, the Indiana SIP, and the Title V operating permit at Petersburg Station. On August 31, 2020, AES Indiana reached a settlement with the EPA, the DOJ and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (“IDEM”), resolving these purported violations of the CAA at Petersburg Station. The settlement agreement, in the form of a proposed judicial consent decree, was approved and entered by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on March 23, 2021, and includes, among other items, the following requirements: annual caps on NO\nx\n and SO\n2\n emissions and more stringent emissions limits than AES Indiana's current Title V air permit; payment of civil penalties totaling $1.5 million; a $5 million environmental mitigation project consisting of the construction and operation of a new, non-emitting source of generation at the site; expenditure of $0.3 million on a state-only environmentally beneficial project to preserve local, ecologically-significant lands; and retirement of Units 1 and 2 prior to July 1, 2023. \nIn December 2018, a lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, and three other AES affiliates. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 100 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands $476 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. Preliminary hearings have taken place. The relevant AES companies believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts.\nIn February 2019, a separate lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, two other AES affiliates, and an unaffiliated company and its principal. Subsequently, the claimants withdrew the lawsuit with respect to AES Puerto Rico. The lawsuit remains pending against the other AES defendants (“AES Defendants”) and the unaffiliated defendants. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 200 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands over $900 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually, nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. In August 2020, at the request of the relevant AES companies, the case was transferred to a different civil court, namely, the Civil Court of La Vega (“CFI”). In May 2024, the CFI dismissed the entire case due to the expiry of the statute of limitations. Later in 2024, the claimants appealed the dismissal to the relevant intermediate appellate court. The claimants are attempting to formally serve the appeal on all defendants. The AES Defendants believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts.\nIn October 2019, the Superintendency of the Environment (the \"SMA\") notified AES Andes of certain alleged breaches associated with the environmental permit of the Ventanas Complex, initiating a sanctioning process through Exempt Resolution N° 1 / ROL D-129-2019. The alleged charges include exceeding generation limits, failing to reduce emissions during episodes of poor air quality, exceeding limits on discharges to the sea, and exceeding noise limits. AES Andes has submitted a proposed “Compliance Program” to the SMA for the Ventanas Complex. \n77 | 2024 Annual Report\nThe latest version of this Compliance Program was submitted on May 26, 2021. On December 30, 2021, the Compliance Program was approved by the SMA. However, an ex officio action was brought by the SMA due to alleged exceedances of generation limits, which would require the Company to reduce SO\n2\n, NO\nX\n and PM emissions in order to achieve the emissions offset established in the Compliance Program. On January 6, 2022, AES Andes filed a reposition with the SMA seeking modification of the means for compliance with the ex officio action. On January 17, 2023, the SMA approved street paving measures, or alternatively a program providing heaters for community members, as the means to satisfy the air emissions offsets in the approved Compliance Plan. The cost of the proposed Compliance Program is approximately $10.8 million and is in the execution stage. Fines are possible if the SMA determines there is an unsatisfactory execution of the Compliance Program. On April 21, 2023, the SMA notified AES Andes of a resolution alleging an additional “serious” non-compliance of the Ventanas Complex failing to reduce emissions during episodes of poor air quality. On May 24, 2023, AES Andes submitted disclaimers to the SMA in response to this resolution. On May 10, 2024, the Company was notified of a fine for $180,515. On June 3, 2024, the Company appealed this fine to the Environmental Court. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and will continue to assert them vigorously in this dispute; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful.\nIn March 2020, Mexico’s Comisión Federal de Electricidad (“CFE”) served an arbitration demand upon AES Mérida III. CFE alleged that AES Mérida was in breach of a power and capacity purchase agreement (“Contract”) between the two parties, even though the allegations relate to CFE’s own failure to provide fuel within the specifications of the Contract. CFE sought to recover approximately $200 million in payments made to AES Mérida under the Contract, plus approximately $480 million in alleged damages for having to acquire power from alternative sources in the Yucatan Peninsula. AES Mérida filed an answer denying liability to CFE and asserted a counterclaim for damages due to CFE’s breach of its obligations. The evidentiary hearing took place in November 2021. Closing arguments were heard in May 2022. In November 2022, the arbitration Tribunal issued its decision in the case, rejecting CFE’s claims for damages and awarding AES Mérida a net amount of damages on AES Mérida’s counterclaims (\"Award\"). There are ongoing proceedings in the Mexican courts concerning AES Mérida's attempt to enforce the Award and CFE's attempt to challenge the Award. At AES Mérida's request, in November 2024, the court of first instance confirmed the award and ordered its enforcement against CFE. This decision is subject to further review within the Mexican judiciary. Separately, in March 2024, the relevant court of first instance denied CFE’s request to nullify the Award. The March 2024 decision was upheld by the relevant federal District Court and later by the Collegiate Circuit Court. AES Mérida believes that it has meritorious claims and defenses and will assert them vigorously in this dispute; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\nOn May 12, 2021, the Mexican Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection (the “Authority”) initiated an environmental audit at the TEP thermal generating facility. On January 20, 2023, TEP was notified of the resolution issued by the Authority, which alleges breaches of air emission regulations, including the failure to submit reports. The resolution imposes a fine of $27,615,140 pesos (approximately $1.3 million). On March 3, 2023, the facility filed a nullity judgment to challenge such resolution, which has been admitted by the local judge with an injunction granted against execution of the proposed fine during the course of the underlying proceedings. However, the local tax authority rejected receiving the bond that is required to guarantee the injunction, and as a result, on September 18, 2023, TEP filed a complaint seeking to compel the tax authority to accept the bond and recognize the validity of the injunction. The Specialized Chamber has not issued a response to the complaint, despite the fact that the Company has taken several legal actions to try to expedite the proceedings. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\nIn February 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 425 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands over $600 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify or provide any supporting information concerning the alleged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. In February 2024, at the request of the Company, the Dominican Supreme Court of Justice transferred the case to a different civil court, namely, the Civil Court of La Vega. The claimants' attempt to recuse the presiding judge has been rejected by the relevant Dominican appellate court. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\n78 | 2024 Annual Report\nOn January 26, 2023, the SMA notified Alto Maipo SpA of four alleged charges relating to the Alto Maipo facility, all of which are categorized by the SMA as “serious.” The alleged charges include untimely completion of intake works and insufficient capture by the provisional works, irrigation water outlet and canal contemplated by an agreement with local communities; non-compliance with the details of the forest management plans and intervention in unauthorized areas; construction of a road in a restricted paleontological area; and unlawful moving of fauna. On February 16, 2023, the Alto Maipo project submitted an initial compliance program to the SMA, which has undergone observations by the SMA and interested third parties, and been resubmitted by the project. On December 9, 2024, the SMA rejected the latest version of the Compliance Program. On December 16, Alto Maipo submitted a petition for reconsideration. If appeals are unsuccessful, the imposition of fines are possible.\nIn May 2024, the Chilean competition agency (the Fiscalía Nacional Económica or “FNE”) opened an investigation regarding AES Andes’s declarations with respect to coal prices and coal blends used to generate electricity in Chile. The investigation was prompted by a confidential complaint filed in December 2023, which has not been disclosed to AES Andes. In general terms, the investigation seeks to determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint could be considered as an abuse of a dominant position by AES Andes. The investigation is at a very early stage; AES Andes is currently responding to the FNE’s information requests. The FNE will independently conduct the investigation and will ultimately decide whether to dismiss the matter or initiate a judicial proceeding on the allegations in the confidential complaint. These types of investigations in Chile commonly last for years. AES Andes does not believe that it has violated any competition laws. Further, if the FNE ever initiates a judicial proceeding on this matter, AES Andes will defend itself vigorously. Given the early nature of this investigation, we are unable to estimate any potential impact of the investigation or its eventual outcome on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor discussion of the Company's year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to Item 7.\n—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nin our 2023 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024.\nExecutive Summary \nIn 2024, AES delivered on its strategic and financial objectives. We completed construction or the acquisition of 3.0 GW of renewables and energy storage, construction of a 670 MW combined cycle gas plant, and signed long-term PPAs for an additional 4.4 GW of new renewable energy. See \nOverview of our Strategy\n included in Item 1.—\nBusiness\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nCompared with last year, net income increased $984 million, from a net loss of $182 million in 2023 to net income of $802 million in 2024. This increase is the result of lower impairments, unrealized foreign currency gains in the current year versus losses in the prior year, gain on sale of AES Brasil, favorable contributions at the Utilities and New Energy Technologies SBUs, and higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year; partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income, and the prior year gain on sell-down of Fluence.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, decreased $189 million, from $2,828 million to $2,639 million, mainly driven by record-breaking drought conditions and outages in Colombia at the Renewables SBU, lower margins at the Energy Infrastructure SBU due to prior year margin at the hedged merchant Southland facilities that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year and higher outages; partially offset by higher contributions at the Utilities SBU and higher revenues from new projects at the Renewables SBU.\nAdjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes, a non-GAAP measure, increased $513 million, from $3,439 million to $3,952 million, primarily due to higher realized tax attributes driven by more renewables projects placed in service, partially offset by the drivers above.\nCompared with last year, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $2.03, from $0.34 to $2.37. This increase is mainly driven by lower long-lived asset impairments in the current year, higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year, prior year unrealized foreign currency losses at the Energy Infrastructure SBU, the gain on sale of AES Brasil, and lower income tax expense. This was partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income, and lower margins due to outages.\nAdjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, increased $0.38 from $1.76 to $2.14, mainly driven by higher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year, a lower adjusted tax rate, and higher contributions from the Utilities SBU; partially offset by lower contributions from the Energy Infrastructure SBU.\n82 | 2024 Annual Report\nReview of Consolidated Results of Operations\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue:\nRenewables SBU\n$\n2,510 \n$\n2,339 \n$\n171 \n7 \n%\nUtilities SBU\n3,608 \n3,495 \n113 \n3 \n%\nEnergy Infrastructure SBU\n6,238 \n6,836 \n(598)\n-9 \n%\nNew Energy Technologies SBU\n1 \n76 \n(75)\n-99 \n%\nCorporate and Other\n162 \n138 \n24 \n17 \n%\nEliminations\n(241)\n(216)\n(25)\n12 \n%\nTotal Revenue\n12,278 \n12,668 \n(390)\n-3 \n%\nOperating Margin:\nRenewables SBU\n359 \n492 \n(133)\n-27 \n%\nUtilities SBU\n543 \n433 \n110 \n25 \n%\nEnergy Infrastructure SBU\n1,273 \n1,418 \n(145)\n-10 \n%\nNew Energy Technologies SBU\n(7)\n(9)\n2 \n-22 \n%\nCorporate and Other\n267 \n239 \n28 \n12 \n%\nEliminations\n(121)\n(69)\n(52)\n75 \n%\nTotal Operating Margin\n2,314 \n2,504 \n(190)\n-8 \n%\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n(288)\n(255)\n(33)\n13 \n%\nInterest expense\n(1,485)\n(1,319)\n(166)\n13 \n%\nInterest income\n381 \n551 \n(170)\n-31 \n%\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n(17)\n(63)\n46 \n-73 \n%\nOther expense\n(175)\n(99)\n(76)\n77 \n%\nOther income\n156 \n89 \n67 \n75 \n%\nGain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests\n351 \n134 \n217 \nNM\nGoodwill impairment expense\n— \n(12)\n12 \n-100 \n%\nAsset impairment expense\n(374)\n(1,067)\n693 \n-65 \n%\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses)\n31 \n(359)\n390 \nNM\nIncome tax expense\n(59)\n(261)\n202 \n-77 \n%\nNet equity in losses of affiliates\n(26)\n(32)\n6 \n-19 \n%\nINCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n809 \n(189)\n998 \nNM\nGain (loss) from disposal of discontinued businesses, net of income tax benefit (expense) of $7, $7, and $0, respectively\n(7)\n7 \n(14)\nNM\nNET INCOME (LOSS)\n802 \n(182)\n984 \nNM\nLess: Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries\n877 \n431 \n446 \nNM\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION\n$\n1,679 \n$\n249 \n$\n1,430 \nNM\nAMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION COMMON STOCKHOLDERS:\n— \n%\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax\n$\n1,686 \n$\n242 \n$\n1,444 \nNM\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n(7)\n7 \n(14)\nNM\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION\n$\n1,679 \n$\n249 \n$\n1,430 \nNM\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,752 \n$\n3,034 \n$\n(282)\n-9 \n%\nComponents of Revenue, Cost of Sales and Operating Margin — \nRevenue includes revenue earned from the sale of energy from our utilities and the production and sale of energy from our generation plants, which are classified as regulated and non-regulated, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Cost of sales also includes the gains or losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the purchase of electricity or fuel.\nOperating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales.\n83 | 2024 Annual Report\nConsolidated Revenue and Operating Margin\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nRevenue\n(in millions)\n    \nConsolidated Revenue\n \n— \nRevenue decreased $390 million, or 3%, in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by: \n•\n$598 million at Energy Infrastructure primarily driven by a $398 million decrease in regulated contract sales and prices, $319 million due to higher revenues from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, $73 million due to lower generation driven by lower dispatch in Argentina, and $69 million impact from the selldown of Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan; partially offset by $195 million higher realized gains on power swaps; and\n•\n$75 million at New Energy Technologies mainly driven by the sale of the Fallbrook project in March 2023.\nThese unfavorable impacts were partially offset by increases of:\n•\n$171 million at Renewables mainly driven by $205 million due to new projects in service, $61 million of unrealized derivative gains, $58 million of higher contracted energy sales, and $35 million due to the appreciation of the Colombian peso; partially offset by $125 million impact from the sale of our controlling interest in AES Brasil, and $69 million due to higher outages and record-breaking drought conditions in Colombia; and\n•\n$113 million at Utilities mainly driven by a $252 million increase in transmission, distribution, and rider revenues mainly due to higher rates, and $57 million due to higher net retail demand mainly driven by favorable weather; partially offset by $181 million of lower Fuel Adjustment Charge rider revenue.\nOperating Margin\n(in millions)\nConsolidated Operating Margin\n \n— \nOperating margin decreased $190 million, or 8%, in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by:\n84 | 2024 Annual Report\n•\n$145 million at Energy Infrastructure mainly driven by $110 million due to higher energy margin from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, $54 million impact from the selldown of Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan, $51 million due to higher outages, $39 million due to end of commercial operations at Warrior Run in May 2024, and $31 million due to lower LNG transactions; partially offset by $82 million from a PPA termination loss recognized in the prior year and $45 million of unrealized derivative gains;\n•\n$133 million at Renewables driven by $148 million impact primarily from record-breaking drought conditions in Colombia, alongside drier hydrological conditions in Brazil, $45 million impact of outages at Colombia due to a flooding incident at the Chivor plant which occurred in June 2024, $44 million impact from the sale of our controlling interest in AES Brasil, and $29 million higher fixed costs primarily due to an accelerated growth plan; partially offset by unrealized derivative gains of $61 million and higher contracted energy sales of $58 million; and\n•\n$24 million at Corporate and Other primarily driven by higher eliminations of insurance recoveries booked at the businesses related to AES' self-insurance company.\nThese unfavorable impacts were partially offset by an increase of $110 million at Utilities primarily driven by $83 million due to higher transmission and rider revenues, $76 million due to higher retail rates as a result of the 2024 Base Rate Order, and $72 million due to higher demand primarily from the impact of weather; partially offset by $57 million higher depreciation from additional assets placed in service, the prior year $29 million deferral of power purchase costs associated with the approval of ESP 4, and $25 million higher expected credit losses due to the one-time implementation of customer billing system upgrades.\nSee Item 7.\n—\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—SBU Performance Analysis\n \nof this Form 10-K for additional discussion and analysis of operating results for each SBU.\nConsolidated Results of Operations — Other\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n \nGeneral and administrative expenses include expenses related to corporate staff functions and initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, and information systems, as well as global development costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $33 million, or 13%, to $288 million in 2024 compared to $255 million in 2023, primarily due to increased business development costs, higher people costs, higher professional fees, and higher IT costs.\nInterest expense \nInterest expense increased $166 million, or 13%, to $1,485 million in 2024, compared to $1,319 million in 2023. This increase was driven by higher interest expense of $67 million and $52 million at the Renewables and Utilities SBUs, respectively, primarily due to new debt issued, net of increased capitalized interest, and higher interest at Corporate of $63 million primarily due to a higher weighted average interest rate and debt balance at the Parent Company; partially offset by a $16 million decrease at the Energy Infrastructure SBU primarily due to lower debt balances.\nInterest income \nInterest income decreased $170 million, or 31%, to $381 million in 2024, compared to $551 million in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in Argentina of $138 million primarily due to lower short-term investments at lower rates and a decrease in Brazil of $51 million due to lower short-term investments and the sale of AES Brasil in October 2024; partially offset by an increase in Chile of $30 million mainly driven by interest recognized on the Stabilization Fund receivables.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt decreased $46 million to $17 million in 2024, compared to $63 million in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to prior year losses of $47 million and $10 million due to prepayments at AES Andes and AES Hispanola Holdings BV, respectively, partially offset by a current year loss of $10 million due to a prepayment at AES Andes.\n85 | 2024 Annual Report\nSee Note 12—\nO\nbligations\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nOther income\nOther income increased $67 million, or 75%, to $156 million in 2024, compared to $89 million in 2023 primarily due to the bargain purchase gain recognized on the Madison and Birdseye acquisition for $20 million, a $17 million increase in gains on remeasurement of contingent consideration primarily on projects acquired at AES Clean Energy, a $14 million gain corresponding to the step acquisition of Felix, and an indexation adjustment of Stabilization Fund receivables at AES Andes of $12 million.\nOther expense\nOther expense increased $76 million, or 77%, to $175 million in 2024, compared to $99 million in 2023 primarily driven by $52 million higher losses on commencement of sales-type leases at AES Renewable Holdings, a $43 million increase in losses on remeasurement of contingent consideration primarily on projects acquired at AES Clean Energy, and a $20 million loss related to legal expenses and other direct costs associated with the troubled debt restructuring at Puerto Rico. This was partially offset by a $36 million decrease in loss on sale and disposal of assets, mainly driven by prior year impairments of inventory due to the planned early plant closures at Ventanas 2, Norgener, and Warrior Run.\nSee Note 22—\nOther Income and Expense\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nGain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests \nGain on disposal and sale of business increased $217 million to $351 million in 2024, compared to $134 million in 2023. This increase was driven by the gain on sale of AES Brasil of $312 million and a $52 million gain corresponding to the dilution of AES' ownership in Uplight as a result of the AutoGrid acquisition; partially offset by a $136 million gain on sale of shares of Fluence, our equity method investment, in 2023, and the $10 million loss on the selldown of Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan, which is now accounted for as an equity method investment.\nSee Note 9—\nInvestments in and Advances to Affiliates\n and Note 25—\nHeld-for-Sale and Dispositions\n \nincluded in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nGoodwill impairment expense \nGoodwill impairment expense was $12 million in 2023 due to impairment at the TEG TEP reporting unit primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate due to increasing risk of non-renewal of operating permits required after March 31, 2024.\nSee Note 10—\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\nAsset impairment expense \nAsset impairment expense decreased $693 million, or 65%, to $374 million in 2024, compared to $1.1 billion in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to higher prior year impairments, including a $198 million impairment associated with PJM's approval to retire the Warrior Run coal-fired facility; a $186 million impairment at New York Wind related to a repowering project that will result in decommissioning the existing turbines and reducing their depreciable lives; a $137 million impairment associated with the commitment to accelerate the retirement of the Norgener coal-fired facility in Chile; a $77 million and $59 million impairment at TEG and TEP, respectively, due to a reduction in expected capacity cash flows after expiration of the current PPA; and a $59 million impairment at Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan due to the delay in closing the sale transaction. In addition, the decrease was driven by lower impairment expense of $105 million associated with the held-for-sale classification of Mong Duong and lower impairment expense of $56 million at AES Clean Energy Development related to the write-off of project development intangibles for projects that were determined to be no longer viable. This was partially offset by current year impairments of $125 million and $80 million at Ventanas and AES Brasil, respectively, after meeting held-for-sale criteria.\nSee Note 23—\nAsset Impairment Expense\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\n86 | 2024 Annual Report\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses) \nForeign currency transaction gains (losses) in millions were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nCorporate\n$\n33 \n$\n(19)\nChile\n(5)\n(40)\nArgentina\n \n(1)\n2\n(312)\nOther\n1 \n12 \nTotal\n \n(2)\n$\n31 \n$\n(359)\n_____________________________\n(1)\n    Includes peso-denominated energy receivable indexed to the USD through the FONINVEMEM agreement which is considered a foreign currency derivative. See Note 7—\nFinancing Receivables\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\n(2)\n    Includes gains of $137 million and losses of $28 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company recognized net foreign currency transaction gains of $31 million in 2024, primarily driven by realized gains on swaps and options denominated in the Brazilian real.\nThe Company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of $359 million in 2023, primarily driven by the depreciation of the Argentine peso, unrealized losses related to an intercompany loan denominated in the Colombian peso, and realized and unrealized foreign currency derivative losses in South America due to the depreciating Colombian peso.\nIncome tax expense \nIncome tax expense was $59 million in 2024 compared to $261 million in 2023. The Company's effective tax rates were 7% and 251% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe 2024 effective tax rate was impacted by the current year benefits associated with ITCs and the restructuring of a foreign holding company. These drivers were partially offset by the impacts of allocations of losses to tax equity investors on renewables projects.\nThe 2023 effective tax rate was impacted by the allocation of losses to noncontrolling interest in U.S. tax-equity partnerships and pretax impairments at certain Mexican subsidiaries and at the Mong Duong coal-fired plant in Vietnam. These impacts were partially offset by inflationary and foreign currency impacts at certain Argentine businesses, net of valuation allowances, as well as the recognition of U.S. investment tax credits for renewables projects placed in service in 2023. See Note 23—\nAsset Impairment Expense\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for details of the asset impairments. \nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate. Foreign earnings may be taxed at rates higher than the U.S. corporate rate of 21% and are also subject to current U.S. taxation under the GILTI rule. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. The Company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. See Note 24—\nIncome Taxes\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these reduced rates.\nNet equity in losses of affiliates\nNet equity in losses of affiliates decreased $6 million, or 19%, to $26 million in 2024, compared to $32 million in 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a $30 million decrease in losses from Fluence, mainly attributable to improved margins on a new product line. This was partially offset by a $13 million decrease in earnings from Mesa La Paz, primarily due to the prior year termination of derivative positions due to a contract amendment; lower earnings from sPower of $7 million, mainly due to lower earnings from renewables projects that came online; and lower earnings from Energía Natural Dominicana Enadom of $7 million due to lower capitalized interest and higher depreciation.\nSee Note 9—\nInvestments In and Advances to Affiliates\n included in Item 8.—\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n of this Form 10-K for further information.\n87 | 2024 Annual Report\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries increased $446 million to $877 million in 2024, compared to $431 million in 2023. This increase was primarily due to:\n•\nHigher allocation of losses to tax equity investors on renewables projects placed in service of $496 million; and\n•\nHigher losses at Brazil of $60 million, primarily due to held-for-sale impairment.\nThese drivers were partially offset by:\n•\nHigher held-for-sale impairment at Mong Duong in the prior year than the current year of $48 million; and\n•\nSelldowns of business interests resulting in larger shares of income attributable to minority shareholders at the Energy Infrastructure SBU of $46 million.\nNet income (loss) attributable to The AES Corporation\nNet income attributable to The AES Corporation increased $1,430 million to $1,679 million in 2024, compared to $249 million in 2023. This increase was primarily due to:\n•\nLower long-lived asset impairments in the current year of $589 million;\n•\nHigher contributions from renewables projects placed in service in the current year of $496 million;\n•\nUnrealized foreign currency losses in the prior year exceeding current year gains by $345 million, primarily driven by higher losses in the prior year at the Energy Infrastructure SBU;\n•\nGain on sale of AES Brasil in the current year of $312 million;\n•\nLower income tax expense attributable to AES, primarily driven by $273 million of tax benefit resulting from the transfer of ITCs directly to third parties; and\n•\nHigher margin from the Utilities SBU impacting net income attributable to AES by $77 million, mainly driven by higher transmission and rider revenues and higher retail rates.\nThese drivers were partially offset by:\n•\nHigher interest expense and lower interest income in the current year of $245 million;\n•\nLower margin from the Energy Infrastructure SBU impacting net income attributable to AES by $147 million, mainly driven by selldowns, higher energy margin from our hedged merchant Southland facilities in the prior year that are contracted primarily for capacity in the current year, and higher outages;\n•\nLower margin at the Renewables SBU impacting net income attributable to AES by $145 million, mainly driven by record-breaking drought conditions and partial outage due to a flooding incident in Colombia; and\n•\nGain on sale of shares in Fluence in the prior year of $136 million.\nSBU Performance Analysis\nSegments\nWe are organized into \nfour\n technology-based SBUs: \nRenewables\n (solar, wind, energy storage, and hydro generation facilities); \nUtilities\n (AES Indiana, AES Ohio, and AES El Salvador regulated utilities and their generation facilities); \nEnergy Infrastructure\n (natural gas, LNG, coal, pet coke, diesel, and oil generation facilities, and our businesses in Chile); and \nNew Energy Technologies\n (investments in Fluence, Uplight, Maximo, and other new and innovative energy technology businesses). Our businesses in Chile, which have a mix of generation sources, including renewables, are included within the Energy Infrastructure SBU, as the generation from all sources is pooled to service our existing PPAs.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes, Adjusted PTC, and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our Consolidated Financial Statements such as investors, industry analysts, and lenders.\n88 | 2024 Annual Report\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company updated the definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to include accretion of AROs in the \ndepreciation and amortization\n add-back. We believe excluding accretion of AROs from these metrics better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is aligned with the metrics of our industry peers. For comparability and consistency, all prior period EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures have been recast to conform to the current presentation. The impact of this update resulted in an increase to Adjusted EBITDA of $22 million and $16 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company updated the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted PTC, and Adjusted EPS add-back (a) \nunrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities\n to include financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option, and updated add-back (e) \ngains, losses, and costs due to the early retirement of debt\n to include troubled debt restructuring. We believe excluding these gains or losses better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company. The Company also removed the adjustment for net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the Energy Infrastructure SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. As this adjustment was specific to certain contract terminations that occurred in 2020, we believe removing this adjustment from our non-GAAP definitions provides simplification and clarity for our investors. There were no such impacts in 2023 or 2024.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company changed the definition of Adjusted EPS to remove the adjustment for \ntax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects, including the 2021 tax benefit on reversal of uncertain tax positions effectively settled upon the closure of the Company's U.S. tax return exam\n. As this adjustment was specific to the impacts of tax law reform enacted in 2017, we believe removing this adjustment from our non-GAAP definition provides simplification and clarity for our investors. There were no such impacts in 2022 or 2023.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes \nWe define EBITDA as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for the impact of NCI and interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs of our equity affiliates, adding back interest income recognized under service concession arrangements, and excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, and financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits, and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; and (e) gains, losses, and costs due to the early retirement of debt or troubled debt restructuring.\nIn addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted EBITDA includes the other components of our Consolidated Statement of Operations, such as \ngeneral and administrative expenses\n in Corporate and Other as well as business development costs, \nother expense\n and \nother income,\n \nrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses,\n and \nnet equity in earnings of affiliates\n.\nWe further define Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes as Adjusted EBITDA, adding back the pre-tax effect of Production Tax Credits (“PTCs”), Investment Tax Credits (“ITCs”), and depreciation tax deductions allocated to tax equity investors, as well as the tax benefit recorded from tax credits retained or transferred to third parties.\nThe GAAP measure most comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes is \nNet income\n. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is the most relevant measure considered in the Company’s internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, or financial assets and liabilities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, and the variability of allocations of earnings to tax equity investors, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, each of these metrics represent the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Given its large number of businesses and overall complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted \n89 | 2024 Annual Report\nEBITDA is a more transparent measure than \nNet income\n that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company’s results.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes should not be construed as alternatives to \nNet income\n, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nYears Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet income (loss)\n$\n802 \n$\n(182)\nIncome tax expense\n59 \n261 \nInterest expense\n1,485 \n1,319 \nInterest income\n(381)\n(551)\nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs\n1,264 \n1,147 \nEBITDA\n$\n3,229 \n$\n1,994 \nLess: (Income) loss from discontinued operations\n7 \n(7)\nLess: Adjustment for noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries \n(1)\n(734)\n(556)\nLess: Income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income) and depreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs from equity affiliates\n136 \n131 \nInterest income recognized under service concession arrangements\n65 \n71 \nUnrealized derivative and equity securities losses (gains)\n(94)\n34 \nUnrealized foreign currency losses\n16 \n301 \nDisposition/acquisition gains\n(323)\n(79)\nImpairment losses\n280 \n877 \nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n57 \n62 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n \n(1)\n$\n2,639 \n$\n2,828 \nTax attributes\n1,313 \n611 \nAdjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes \n(2)\n$\n3,952 \n$\n3,439 \n_____________________________\n(1)\nThe allocation of earnings and losses to tax equity investors from both consolidated entities and equity affiliates is removed from Adjusted EBITDA.

It also includes the tax benefit recorded from tax credits retained or transferred to third parties. The tax attributes are related to the Renewables and Utilities SBUs.\n90 | 2024 Annual Report\nAdjusted PTC \nWe define Adjusted PTC as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, and financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits, and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; and (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt or troubled debt restructuring. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.\nAdjusted PTC reflects the impact of NCI and excludes the items specified in the definition above. In addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC includes the other components of our Consolidated Statement of Operations, such as \ngeneral and administrative expenses\n in the Corporate segment, as well as business development costs, \ninterest expense\n and \ninterest income,\n \nother expense\n and \nother income,\n \nrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses,\n and \nnet equity in earnings of affiliates\n.\nThe GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is \nincome from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation\n. We believe that Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, or financial assets and liabilities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, Adjusted PTC represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Given its large number of businesses and complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted PTC is a more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company's results. \nAdjusted PTC should not be construed as an alternative to \nincome from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation\n, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nYears Ended December 31,\nReconciliation of Adjusted PTC (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nIncome from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to The AES Corporation\n$\n1,686\n \n$\n242\n \nIncome tax expense (benefit) attributable to The AES Corporation\n(19)\n206 \nPre-tax contribution\n1,667 \n448 \nUnrealized derivative and equity securities losses (gains)\n(94)\n41 \nUnrealized foreign currency losses\n16 \n301 \nDisposition/acquisition gains\n(320)\n(79)\nImpairment losses\n280 \n877 \nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n65 \n70 \nTotal Adjusted PTC\n$\n1,614 \n$\n1,658 \n91 | 2024 Annual Report\nAdjusted EPS \nWe define Adjusted EPS as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, and financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; and (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt or troubled debt restructuring.\nThe GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, or financial assets and liabilities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods.

This increase was partially offset by $21 million higher general and administrative expenses mainly related to higher development costs.\nKey Trends and Uncertainties \nDuring 2025 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. Management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses, and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. If these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may have a material impact on our operating margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1.—\nBusiness\n and",
    "item1a": "Item 1A.—\nRisk Factors\n, \nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results and position\n; \nWholesale power prices may experience significant volatility in our markets which could impact our operations and opportunities for future growth;\n \nWe may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates; and Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology \nof this 2024 Form 10-K.\nCommodity Price Risk\nAlthough we prefer to hedge our exposure to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of commodities, some of our generation businesses operate under short-term sales, have contracted electricity obligations greater than supply, or operate under contract sales that leave an unhedged exposure on some of our capacity or through imperfect fuel pass-throughs. These businesses subject our operational results to the volatility of prices for electricity, fuels, and environmental credits in competitive markets. In addition, our businesses are exposed to lower electricity prices due to increased competition, including from renewable sources such as wind and solar, because of lower costs of entry and lower variable costs. We employ risk management strategies to hedge our financial performance against these effects. The implementation of these strategies can involve the use of physical and financial commodity contracts, futures, swaps, and options. We have some natural offsets across our businesses such that low commodity prices may benefit certain businesses and be a cost to others. Exposures are not perfectly linear or symmetric. The sensitivities are affected by a number of local or indirect market factors. Examples of these factors include hydrology, local energy market supply/demand balances, regional fuel supply issues, regional \n114 | 2024 Annual Report\ncompetition, bidding strategies, and regulatory interventions such as price caps. Volume variation also affects our commodity exposure. The volume sold under contracts or retail concessions can vary based on weather and economic conditions, resulting in a higher or lower volume of sales in spot markets. Thermal unit availability and hydrology can affect the generation output available for sale and can affect the marginal unit setting power prices.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we project pre-tax earnings exposure on a 10% increase in commodity prices to be less than a $5 million gain for power, less than a $5 million gain for gas, and less than a $5 million loss for coal. The sensitivities are calculated using industry-standard valuation techniques to revalue all transactions (physical and financial commodity transactions) in the portfolio for a change in the underlying prices the transactions are exposed to and excludes correlation effects, including those due to renewable resource availability. The models reference market prices of commodities across future periods and associated volatility of these market prices. Prices and volatilities are predominantly based on observable market prices.\nExposures at individual businesses will change as new contracts or financial hedges are executed, and our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices generally increases in later years with reduced hedge levels at some of our businesses.\nIn the Energy Infrastructure SBU, the generation businesses are largely contracted, but may have residual risk to the extent contracts are not perfectly indexed to the business drivers. In California, our Southland once-through cooling generation units (“Legacy Assets”) in Long Beach and Huntington Beach have been extended to operate through 2026 under capacity contracts with the State as part of the Strategic Reserve program. Our facility in Redondo Beach has been retired effective January 1, 2024. Our ability to operate the Long Beach facility at full capacity through 2025 was approved under Tentative Time Schedule Order coverage in November 2023. Approval to operate Long Beach through 2026 will be subject to review with State Agencies. Our Southland combined cycle gas turbine (Southland Energy) units benefit from higher power and lower gas prices, depending on the contracted or hedge position. The AES Andes business in Chile owns assets in the central and northern regions of the country and has a portfolio of contract sales in both. A significant portion of our PPAs through 2025 include mechanisms of indexation that adjust the price of energy based on fluctuations in the price of coal, with an index defined by the National Energy Commission based on the physical coal imports for the energy system. This mechanism mitigates exposures to changes in the price of fuel. The increasing share of renewable energy in Chile's power market may reduce reliance on thermal units and impact power price volatility, which could impact our cost to serve certain unregulated PPAs. In the Dominican Republic, we own natural gas plants contracted under a portfolio of contract sales, and both contract and spot prices may move with commodity prices through 2024. Our thermal asset in Panama has PPAs with distribution companies which matches the term of the LNG supply agreement of such thermal assets. New entrants into the Panama thermal generation market could impact the dispatch of existing generation, requiring purchases in the spot market to satisfy the PPA obligations. Contract levels do not always match our generation availability or needs, and our assets may be sellers of spot prices in excess of contract levels or a net buyer in the spot market to satisfy contract obligations, which could impact existing fuel supply commitments. Our assets operating in Vietnam and Bulgaria have minimal exposure to commodity price risk as they have no or minor merchant exposure and fuel is subject to a pass-through mechanism.\nIn the Renewables SBU, our businesses have commodity exposure on unhedged volumes and resource volatility and benefit from higher power prices, where generation exceeds contracted levels. In Colombia, we operate under a shorter-term sales strategy with spot market exposure for uncontracted volumes. Because we own hydroelectric assets there, contracts are not indexed to fuel. Our Renewables businesses in Panama are highly contracted under financial and load-following PPA type structures, exposing the business to hydrology-based variance. To the extent hydrological inflows are greater than or less than the contract volumes, the business will be sensitive to changes in spot power prices which may be driven by oil and natural gas prices in some time periods.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. \nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risks that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of these risks stems from the fact that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency, the USD. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations in USD or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries calculate and pay \n115 | 2024 Annual Report\ntaxes in currencies other than their own functional currency. We have varying degrees of exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies: Argentine peso, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Dominican peso, Euro, and Mexican peso. Our exposure to certain of these currencies may be material. These subsidiaries and affiliates attempt to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. We also use foreign currency forwards, swaps, and options where possible to manage our risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations.\nAES enters into foreign currency hedges to protect economic value of the business and minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to AES' portfolio. While protecting cash flows, the hedging strategy is also designed to reduce forward-looking earnings foreign exchange volatility. Due to variation of timing and amount between cash distributions and earnings exposure, the hedge impact may not fully cover the earnings exposure on a realized basis, which could result in greater volatility in earnings. \nAES has unhedged forward-looking earnings which are exposed to foreign exchange deterioration risk from the Argentine peso that could be material. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, assuming a 10% USD appreciation, cash distributions attributable to foreign subsidiaries in the Colombian peso, Euro, and Argentine peso individually, may be exposed to exchange rate movement of less than a $5 million loss. These numbers have been produced by applying a one-time 10% USD appreciation to forecasted exposed cash distributions for 2025 coming from the respective subsidiaries exposed to the currencies listed above, net of the impact of outstanding hedges and holding all other variables constant. The numbers presented above are net of any transactional gains or losses. These sensitivities may change in the future as new hedges are executed or existing hedges are unwound. Additionally, updates to the forecasted cash distributions exposed to foreign exchange risk may result in further modification. The sensitivities presented do not capture the impacts of any administrative market restrictions or currency inconvertibility.\nInterest Rate Risks\nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates primarily because of our current and expected future issuance of debt and borrowing.\nDecisions on the fixed-floating debt mix are made to be consistent with the risk factors faced by individual businesses or plants. Depending on whether a plant’s capacity payments or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflation, we partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations by arranging fixed-rate or variable-rate financing. In certain cases, particularly for non-recourse financing, we execute interest rate swap, cap, and floor agreements to effectively fix or limit the interest rate exposure on the underlying financing. Most of our interest rate risk is related to non-recourse financings at our businesses.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the portfolio’s pre-tax earnings exposure to a one-time 100-basis-point increase in interest rates for our Argentine peso, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Euro, and USD denominated debt would be less than $15 million on interest expense for the debt denominated in these currencies. These amounts represent 2025 full year exposure and do not take into account the historical correlation between these interest rates.\n116 | 2024 Annual Report\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nPart A \n—\n Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nOur auditors are \nErnst & Young LLP\n, located in \nTysons, Virginia\n. Their PCAOB ID number is \n42\n.\nPart B \n—\n Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n117 | 2024 Annual Report\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The AES Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The AES Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 10, 2025 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n118 | 2024 Annual Report\nAllocation of Earnings to Noncontrolling Interests in Tax Equity Partnerships\nDescription of the Matter\nA significant number of renewables projects at AES Clean Energy have been financed with tax equity structures, where the tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects. When the allocation of earnings and losses, cash distributions, and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages, the Company uses the hypothetical liquidation at book value (HLBV) method to calculate the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest for consolidated partnerships, when it is a reasonable approximation of the profit-sharing arrangement. As discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, AES Clean Energy Development and AES Renewable Holdings sold noncontrolling interest to tax equity investors resulting in an increase of $866 million to noncontrolling interest in 2024.\nAuditing the allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interest holders for significant new tax equity partnerships was complex due to the evaluation of whether a newly established HLBV model used to allocate earnings appropriately reflects the unique substantive profit-sharing terms and features within each arrangement. A greater extent of audit effort and specialized skill and knowledge was required to evaluate compliance with the contractual provisions in each partnership agreement as well as the appropriateness of the investors’ capital account balances used in the HLBV models.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Company’s process for developing the HLBV model for new tax equity arrangements. For example, we tested management’s review of substantive profit-sharing terms to evaluate whether they are properly reflected in the HLBV model for new arrangements.\nTo test the allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interest holders for new significant tax equity partnerships, we read the related partnership agreements to understand the substantive profit-sharing provisions. We evaluated the HLBV models for consistency with the contractual provisions in the related partnership agreements and tested the capital contributions made by the tax equity investors and tax credits transferred by the partnership. We involved tax subject matter professionals to assist in evaluating the calculation of the investors’ capital accounts used in the HLBV models, including the proceeds attributable to the tax equity investor due to the recognition of investment tax credits and other adjustments as required by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, we tested the allocation of earnings by recalculating the hypothetical liquidation in the HLBV models based on the liquidation provisions of the related partnership agreements.\nAccounting for the Madison and Birdseye Acquisition\nDescription of the Matter\nDuring 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of the Madison solar project and the Birdseye pipeline of early-stage renewable energy development projects. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination with a purchase price of $20 million paid in cash, as disclosed in Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements. The acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of $20 million, primarily due to the determination that the Madison solar project would qualify for an increased investment tax credit (ITC) based on studies performed subsequent to the acquisition date, which resulted in a measurement period adjustment related to the increase of the fair value of assets acquired. \nAuditing the Company's accounting for the acquisition was complex due to the unobservable inputs used by management to determine the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, primarily consisting of the construction work in progress (CWIP) of $78 million and the off-market virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) liability of $53 million. These fair value estimates were sensitive to the significant assumptions used, including the market PPA price, forecasted operating expenses, and the discount rates utilized, which affected the bargain purchase gain recognized.\n119 | 2024 Annual Report\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the accounting for the acquisition. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s accounting considerations and the valuation of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including management’s review of the valuation models, the significant assumptions used to develop the estimates, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the valuations. \nTo test the estimated fair value of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the significant assumptions used, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared the significant assumptions used by management to third-party industry and market data and to the Company’s historical operating results. We involved our internal valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the reasonableness of the Company’s valuation methodology and the discount rates used in the valuations. We also tested the Company’s measurement period adjustment, including assumptions used in determining the Madison solar project’s qualification for the ITC, and the Company’s assessment over the bargain purchase recognized in the transaction.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\nTysons, Virginia\nMarch 10, 2025\n120     \nConsolidated Balance

GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the Company\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION \n— The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Certain consolidated VIEs have arrangements which may require the Company to contribute additional equity totaling $\n1.7 billion\n. Such contributions are generally contingent upon the underlying asset achieving specific project milestones. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n \nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS \n— Noncontrolling interests are classified as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Additionally, net income and comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests are reflected separately from consolidated net income and comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling financial interest is retained is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and noncontrolling interests. Losses continue to be attributed to the noncontrolling interests, even when the noncontrolling interests' basis has been reduced to zero.\nNoncontrolling interests with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the issuer are classified as temporary equity and are included in \nRedeemable stock of subsidiaries\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, initial measurement will be at fair value. The subsequent allocation of income and dividends is classified in temporary equity. Subsequent measurement and classification vary depending on whether the instrument is probable of becoming redeemable. For those securities that are currently redeemable or where it is probable that the instrument will become redeemable, AES recognizes any changes from the carrying value to redemption value at each reporting period against retained earnings or additional paid-in capital in the absence of retained earnings; such adjustments are classified in temporary equity. When the equity instrument is not probable of becoming redeemable, no adjustment to the carrying value is recognized. Instruments that are mandatorily redeemable are classified as a liability.\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS \n— Investments in entities over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and reported in \nInvestments in and advances to affiliates\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in\n Net equity in losses of affiliates \non the Consolidated Statements of Operations\n. \nThe Company utilizes the cumulative earnings approach to determine whether distributions received from equity method investees are returns on investment or returns of investment. The Company discontinues the application of the equity method when an investment is reduced to zero and the Company is not otherwise committed to provide further financial support to the investee. The Company resumes the application of the equity method accounting to the extent that net income is greater than the share of net losses not previously recorded. \nUpon acquiring the investment, we determine the fair value of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and the basis difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of each corresponding asset or liability in the financial statements of the investee. The AES share of the amortization of the basis difference is recognized in\n Net equity in losses of affiliates\n in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the life of the asset or liability.\n127 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nThe Company periodically assesses if impairment indicators exist at our equity method investments. When an impairment is observed, any excess of the carrying amount over its estimated fair value is recognized as impairment expense when the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary and included in \nOther non-operating expense\n in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \nBUSINESS INTERESTS \n— Acquisitions and disposals of business interests are generally transactions pertaining to operational legal entities, which may be accounted for as a consolidated business, an asset acquisition, or an equity method investment. Any gains or losses upon the completion of disposals, which include reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments, are recognized in \nGain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests\n in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon completion of the sale.\n \nALLOCATION OF EARNINGS\n — Certain of the Company's businesses are subject to profit-sharing arrangements where the allocation of earnings and losses, cash distributions, and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. \nMany of these arrangements exist for certain U.S. renewable generation partnerships to designate different allocations of value among investors, where the allocations change in form or percentage over the life of the partnership. For these businesses, the Company uses the HLBV method when it is a reasonable approximation of the profit-sharing arrangement. The HLBV method calculates the proceeds that would be attributable to each partner based on the liquidation provisions of the respective operating partnership agreement if the partnership was to be liquidated at book value at the balance sheet date. Each partner’s share of income in the period is equal to the change in the amount of net equity they are legally able to claim based on a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at the end of a reporting period compared to the beginning of that period, adjusted for any capital transactions. \nThe HLBV method is used both to allocate the equity earnings attributable to AES when the Company accounts for the renewables business as an equity method investment and to calculate the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest when the business is consolidated by AES. In the early months of operations of a renewable generation facility where HLBV results in a significant decrease in the hypothetical liquidation proceeds attributable to the tax equity investor due to the recognition of ITCs or other adjustments as required by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Company records the impact (sometimes referred to as the ‘Day one gain’) to income in the same period. \nIn some other arrangements, consolidated subsidiaries are subject to profit-sharing arrangements where cash distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are based on a stated internal rate of return, among other criteria. In many of these arrangements, earnings are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders based on the stated internal rate of return to the noncontrolling interest holders for any given period.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES \n— U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset and liability balances reported as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include: estimated useful lives of long-lived assets; asset retirement obligations; impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and equity method investments; valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets; the recoverability of regulatory assets; regulatory liabilities; the fair value of financial instruments; the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as business combinations or as asset acquisitions by variable interest entities; contingent consideration arising from business combinations or asset acquisitions by variable interest entities; the measurement of equity method investments or noncontrolling interest using the HLBV method for certain renewable generation partnerships; pension liabilities; the incremental borrowing rates used in the determination of lease liabilities; the determination of lease and non-lease components in certain generation contracts; environmental liabilities; temporary equity; and potential litigation claims and settlements.\nHELD-FOR-SALE DISPOSAL GROUPS \n— A disposal group classified as held-for-sale is reflected on the balance sheet at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell. A loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the disposal group exceeds its estimated fair value less costs to sell. If the fair value of the disposal group subsequently exceeds the carrying amount while the disposal group is still held-for-sale, any impairment expense previously recognized will be reversed up to the lesser of the previously recognized expense or the subsequent excess.\nAssets and liabilities related to a disposal group classified as held-for-sale are segregated in the balance sheet in the period in which the disposal group is classified as held-for-sale. Assets and liabilities of held-for-sale disposal groups are classified as current when they are expected to be settled or disposed of within twelve months and as \n128 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nnoncurrent when they are not expected to be settled or disposed of within the next twelve months. Transactions between the held-for-sale disposal group and businesses that are expected to continue to exist after the disposal are not eliminated to appropriately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale. See Note 25—\nHeld-for-Sale and Dispositions\n \nfor further information.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS \n— Discontinued operations reporting occurs only when the disposal of a business or a group of businesses represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. The Company reports financial results for discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. Prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets are retrospectively revised to reflect the businesses determined to be discontinued operations. The cash flows of businesses that are determined to be discontinued operations are included within the relevant categories within operating, investing and financing activities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \nTransactions between the businesses determined to be discontinued operations and businesses that are expected to continue to exist after the disposal are not eliminated to appropriately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale. The results of discontinued operations include any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell, including gains or losses associated with noncontrolling interests upon completion of the disposal transaction. Adjustments related to components previously reported as discontinued operations under prior accounting guidance are presented as discontinued operations in the current period even if the disposed-of component to which the adjustments are related would not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation under current guidance.\nFAIR VALUE \n— Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly, hypothetical transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The Company applies the fair value measurement accounting guidance to financial assets and liabilities in determining the fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities, included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line items \nShort-term investments\n and \nOther noncurrent assets\n; derivative assets, included in \nOther current assets\n and \nOther noncurrent assets\n; and, derivative liabilities, included in \nAccrued and other liabilities (current)\n and \nOther noncurrent liabilities\n. The Company applies the fair value measurement guidance to nonfinancial assets and liabilities upon the acquisition of a business or assets, or in conjunction with the measurement of an asset retirement obligation or a potential impairment loss on an asset group, equity method investments, or goodwill. \nWhen determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be reflected at their fair values, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. The Company is prohibited from including transaction costs and any adjustments for blockage factors in determining fair value.\nIn determining fair value measurements, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are categorized within a fair value hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement:\n•\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n•\nLevel 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or\n•\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.\nAny transfers between all levels within the fair value hierarchy levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS \n— The Company considers unrestricted cash on hand, cash balances not restricted as to withdrawal or usage, deposits in banks, certificates of deposit and short-term marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.\n \nRESTRICTED CASH AND DEBT SERVICE RESERVES \n— Cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or usage, primarily via contract, are considered restricted cash.\n129 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets that reconcile to the total of such amounts as shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in millions): \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,524\n \n$\n1,426\n \nRestricted cash\n437\n \n370\n \nDebt service reserves and other deposits\n78\n \n194\n \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash \n$\n2,039\n \n$\n1,990\n \nINVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES \n— The Company's marketable investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. \nShort-term investments consist of marketable equity securities and debt securities with original maturities in excess of three months with remaining maturities of less than one year. Marketable debt securities where the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. Remaining marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading and are carried at fair value.\n Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale debt securities that are not credit-related are reflected in AOCL, a separate component of equity, and the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any credit-related impairments are recognized as an allowance with a corresponding impact recognized as a credit loss in \nOther expense. \nUnrealized gains or losses on equity investments are reported in \nOther income\n. Interest and dividends on investments are reported in \nInterest income\n and \nOther income\n, respectively. Gains and losses on sales of investments are determined using the specific identification method.\nACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES \n— Accounts and notes receivable are carried at amortized cost. The Company periodically assesses the collectability of accounts receivable, considering factors such as historical collection experience, the age of accounts receivable and other currently available evidence supporting collectability, and records an allowance for credit losses for the estimated uncollectible amount as appropriate. Credit losses on accounts and notes receivable are generally recognized in \nCost of Sales\n. Certain of our businesses charge interest on accounts receivable. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. When collection of such interest is not reasonably assured, interest income is recognized as cash is received. Individual accounts and notes receivable are written off when they are no longer deemed collectible.\nINVENTORY \n— Inventory primarily consists of fuel and other raw materials used to generate power, and operational spare parts and supplies used to maintain power generation and distribution facilities. Inventory is carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is the sum of the purchase price and expenditures incurred to bring the inventory to its existing location. Inventory is primarily valued using the average cost method. Generally, if it is expected fuel inventory will not be recovered through revenue earned from power generation, an impairment is recognized to reflect the fuel at net realizable value. The carrying amount of spare parts and supplies is typically reduced only in instances where the items are considered obsolete.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS \n— Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, assets under finance leases and intangible assets subject to amortization (i.e., finite-lived intangible assets).\nProperty, plant and equipment \n— Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The cost of renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are capitalized.\nConstruction progress payments, engineering costs, insurance costs, salaries, interest and other costs directly relating to construction in progress are capitalized during the construction period, provided the completion of the construction project is deemed probable, or expensed at the time construction completion is determined to no longer be probable. The continued capitalization of such costs is subject to risks related to successful completion, including those related to government approvals, site identification, financing, construction permitting and contract compliance. Assets are placed in service when an asset group is ready for its intended use. Government subsidies, refundable income tax credits that are accounted for as government grants, and liquidated damages recovered for construction delays are recorded as a reduction to property, plant and equipment and reflected in cash flows from investing activities. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. \nDepreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or \n130 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\ncomponent basis. Capital spare parts, including rotable spare parts, are included in electric generation and distribution assets. If the spare part is considered a component, it is depreciated over its useful life after the part is placed in service. If the spare part is deemed part of a composite asset, the part is depreciated over the composite useful life even when being held as a spare part.\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries operate under concession contracts. Certain estimates are utilized to determine depreciation expense for the subsidiaries, including the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and the amounts to be recovered at the end of the concession contract. The amounts to be recovered under these concession contracts are based on estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual amounts recovered may differ from those estimates. These concession contracts are not within the scope of ASC 853.\nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization \n— Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives which range from \n1\n – \n50\n years and are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line item \nOther intangible assets. \nNet assets acquired in a business combination recognized as project development intangibles represent the value attributable to in-process development associated with future operating assets. An intangible asset is recognized when construction activities have yet to commence and the development work completed consists of contractual arrangements which are intangible in nature, such as permitting, contracting, and surveying. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method beginning when a project is placed in service and continuing over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company accounts for purchased emission allowances as intangible assets and records an expense when they are utilized or sold. Granted emission allowances are valued at zero.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets \n— When circumstances indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment using internal projections of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and eventual disposal of the assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value (subject to the carrying amount not being reduced below fair value for any individual long-lived asset that is determinable without undue cost and effort). An impairment expense for certain assets may be reduced by the establishment of a regulatory asset if recovery through approved rates is probable.\nDEBT ISSUANCE COSTS \n— Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and presented as a direct reduction from the face amount of that debt and amortized over the related financing period using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit or revolving credit facility are deferred and presented as an asset and amortized over the related financing period. Make-whole payments in connection with early debt retirements are classified as cash flows used in financing activities.\nGOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS \n— The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. The Company's annual impairment testing date is October 1\nst\n.\nGoodwill \n— Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the business acquisition over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill resulting from an acquisition is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Generally, each AES business with a goodwill balance constitutes a reporting unit as they are not similar to other businesses in a segment nor are they reported to segment management together with other businesses.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment either under the qualitative assessment option or the quantitative test option to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. If goodwill is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss measured at the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill, is recorded. \nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \n— The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include land-use rights and transmission rights. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment either under the qualitative assessment option or by performing the quantitative impairment test. If the carrying amount of an \n131 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nintangible asset being tested for impairment exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as impairment expense.\n \nACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES \n— Accounts payable consists of amounts due to trade creditors related to the Company's core business operations. These payables include amounts owed to vendors and suppliers for items such as energy purchased for resale, fuel, maintenance, inventory and other raw materials. The remaining balance of other accrued liabilities includes items such as income taxes, regulatory liabilities, legal contingencies, environmental remediation costs, and employee-related costs, including payroll, and benefits.\nREGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \n— The Company recognizes assets and liabilities that result from regulated ratemaking processes. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs which have been deferred due to the probable future recovery via customer rates. Generally, returns earned on regulatory assets are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within \nInterest income\n. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to refund customers. Management continually assesses whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and regulatory liabilities are probable of future payment by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs previously deferred ceases to be probable, the related regulatory assets are written off and recognized in income from continuing operations.\nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS \n— The Company recognizes in its Consolidated Balance Sheets an asset or liability reflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement plans with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in AOCL, except for those plans at certain of the Company's regulated utilities that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligations through future rates. All plan assets are recorded at fair value and categorized by level within the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 1—\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Fair Value\n. AES follows the measurement date provisions of the accounting guidance, which require a year-end measurement date of plan assets and obligations for all defined benefit plans\n.\nINCOME TAXES \n— Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax basis. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's tax positions are evaluated under a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement analysis before they are recognized for financial statement reporting.\nUncertain tax positions have been classified as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company's policy for interest and penalties related to income tax exposures is to recognize interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company has elected to treat GILTI as an expense in the period in which the tax is accrued. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to GILTI.\nThe Company applies the flow-through method to account for its investment tax credits.\nThe Company's accounting policy for releasing the income tax effects from AOCL occurs on a portfolio basis.\nThe Company has elected an accounting policy not to consider the effects of being subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in future periods when assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, carryforwards, and tax credits. Any effect on the realization of deferred tax assets will be recognized in the period they arise. \nHistorically, the Company has financed renewables projects with investments from tax equity investors who are allocated certain tax benefits associated with renewable energy projects (e.g. investment tax credits) through partnership agreements. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \"IRA\") allows the owners of renewable energy projects to transfer tax credits directly to unrelated tax credit buyers. This provides the Company with the flexibility to obtain financing on any particular project with (i) the transfer of tax credits or (ii) investments from tax equity investors who are allocated tax benefits. The Company may also elect to retain the tax credit and use it to reduce its tax liability.\n132 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nThe Company accounts for tax credits that it will retain or transfer under ASC 740—\nIncome Taxes,\n as a reduction in income tax expense by either including the expected amount of the tax credit to be claimed or the cash to be received when transferred, respectively, in the calculation of its annual effective tax rate throughout the year the renewables project is placed in service. The estimated tax credits are updated on a quarterly basis, with the year-end calculation including only the tax credits that are associated with projects placed in service, comprising credits claimed or transferred during the year. In assessing realizability for credits to be transferred, the Company includes cash it anticipates receiving in establishing any valuation allowance and establishes a valuation allowance equal to its best estimate of any discount on the transfer. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company executed agreements to transfer ITCs directly to third parties for $\n555\n million. Of this amount, $\n309\n million and $\n26\n million was allocated to AES and recorded as an income tax benefit in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $\n220\n million was allocated to noncontrolling interests and treated as a contribution from noncontrolling interest holders. The Company received cash proceeds from these tax credit transfers of $\n480\n million during the year ended December 31, 2024, and recorded a receivable in \nOther current assets\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the remaining $\n75\n million, which is expected to be received in March 2025. The receipt of cash from the transfer of tax credits is treated as an operating cash inflow on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS \n— The Company records the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. When a new liability is recognized, the Company capitalizes the costs of the liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the obligation, the Company eliminates the liability and, based on the actual cost to retire, may incur a gain or loss.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION \n— A business's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the business operates and is generally the currency in which the business generates and expends cash. Subsidiaries and affiliates whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar translate their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates in effect at the end of the fiscal period. Adjustments arising from the translation of the balance sheet of such subsidiaries are included in AOCL. The revenue and expense accounts of such subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates for the period. Gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency transactions that are long-term in nature and which the Company does not intend to settle in the foreseeable future, are also recognized in AOCL. Gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in determining net income. Accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified from AOCL to net income only when realized upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment in a foreign entity. The accumulated adjustments are included in carrying amounts in impairment assessments where the Company has committed to a plan that will cause the accumulated adjustments to be reclassified to earnings\n.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION \n— Revenue is earned from the sale of electricity from our utilities, the production and sale of electricity and capacity from our generation facilities, and development and construction of generation facilities. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recorded net of any taxes assessed on and collected from customers, which are remitted to the governmental authorities.\nUtilities\n \n— \nOur utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers directly. The majority of our utility contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promises to transfer energy, capacity, and other distribution and/or transmission services are not distinct. Additionally, as the performance obligation is satisfied over time as energy is delivered, and the same method is used to measure progress, the performance obligation meets the criteria to be considered a series. Utility revenue is classified as regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nIn exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service territory, our utility businesses are subject to government regulation. This regulation sets the framework for the prices (“tariffs”) that our utilities are allowed to charge customers for electricity. Since tariffs are determined by the regulator, the price that our utilities have the right to bill corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the utility's performance completed in each period. The Company also has some month-to-month contracts. Revenue under these contracts is recognized using an \n133 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\noutput method measured by the MWh delivered each month, which best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer, at the approved tariff. \nThe Company has businesses where it sells and purchases power to and from ISOs and RTOs. Our utility businesses generally purchase power to satisfy the demand of customers that is not contracted through separate PPAs. In these instances, the Company accounts for these transactions on a net hourly basis because the transactions are settled on a net hourly basis. In limited situations, a utility customer may choose to receive generation services from a third-party provider, in which case the Company may serve as a billing agent for the provider and recognize revenue on a net basis.\nGeneration — \nMost of our generation fleet sells electricity under contracts to customers such as utilities, industrial users, and corporate clients. Our generation contracts, based on specific facts and circumstances, can have one or more performance obligations as the promise to transfer energy, capacity, and other services may or may not be distinct depending on the nature of the market and terms of the contract. \nFor contracts determined to have multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price using a market or expected cost plus margin approach. Additionally, the Company allocates variable consideration to one or more, but not all, distinct goods or services that form part of a single performance obligation when (1) the variable consideration relates specifically to the efforts to transfer the distinct good or service and (2) the variable consideration depicts the amount to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer.\nIf the contract is determined to contain a performance obligation related to capacity, the performance obligation is generally satisfied over time, and if we use the same method to measure progress, the performance obligations meet the criteria to be considered a series. In measuring progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligation, the Company applies the \"right to invoice\" practical expedient when available and recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Company has a right to consideration from a customer that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date. Revenue from generation businesses is classified as non-regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nEnergy performance obligations are recognized using an output method, as energy delivered best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer. Performance obligations to deliver energy are generally satisfied when the MW is generated. In certain contracts, if plant availability exceeds a contractual target, the Company may receive a performance bonus payment, or if the plant availability falls below a guaranteed minimum target, we may incur a non-availability penalty. Such bonuses or penalties represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated and recognized when it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal. \nCertain generation contracts contain operating and sales-type leases where capacity payments are generally considered lease elements. In such cases, the allocation between the lease and non-lease elements is made at the inception of the lease following the guidance in ASC 842.\nIn assessing whether variable quantities are considered variable consideration or an option to acquire additional goods and services, the Company evaluates the nature of the promise and the legally enforceable rights in the contract. In some contracts, such as requirement contracts, the legally enforceable rights merely give the customer a right to purchase additional goods and services which are distinct. In these contracts, the customer's action results in a new obligation, and the variable quantities are considered an option.\n \nWhen energy or capacity is sold or purchased in the spot market or to ISOs, the Company assesses the facts and circumstances to determine gross versus net presentation of spot revenues and purchases. Generally, the nature of the performance obligation is to sell surplus energy or capacity above contractual commitments, or to purchase energy or capacity to satisfy deficits. Generally, on an hourly basis, a generator is either a net seller or a net buyer in terms of the amount of energy or capacity transacted with the ISO. In these situations, the Company recognizes revenue for the hours where the generator is a net seller and cost of sales for the hours where the generator is a net buyer.\nThe transaction price allocated to a construction performance obligation is recognized as revenue over time as construction activity occurs, with revenue being fully recognized upon completion of construction. These contracts may include a difference in timing between revenue recognition and the collection of cash receipts, which may be collected over the term of the entire arrangement. The timing difference could result in a significant financing component for the construction performance obligation if determined to be a material component of the transaction \n134 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nprice. The Company accounts for a significant financing component under the effective interest rate method, recognizing a long-term receivable for the expected future payments related to the construction performance obligation in the \nOther noncurrent assets \nline item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As payments are collected from the customer over the term of the contract, consideration related to the construction performance obligation is bifurcated between the principal repayment of the long-term receivable and the related interest income, recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nContract Balances\n — The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in accounts receivable and contract liabilities. Accounts receivable represent unconditional rights to consideration and consist of both billed amounts and unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under long-term contracts when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. We bill both generation and utilities customers on a contractually agreed-upon schedule, typically at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly). The calculation of revenue earned but not yet billed is based on the number of days not billed in the month, the estimated amount of energy delivered during those days and the estimated average price per customer class for that month. \nOur contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue. The current portion of our contract liabilities is reported in \nAccrued and other liabilities\n and the noncurrent portion is reported in \nOther noncurrent liabilities\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nRemaining Performance Obligations — \nThe transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents future consideration for unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the reporting period. The Company has elected to apply the optional disclosure exemptions under ASC 606. Therefore, the amount disclosed in Note 21—\nRevenue\n \nexcludes contracts with an original length of one year or less, contracts for which we recognize revenue based on the amount we have the right to invoice for services performed, and variable consideration allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation when the consideration relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy the performance obligation and depicts the amount to which we expect to be entitled. As such, consideration for energy is excluded from the amount disclosed as the variable consideration relates to the amount of energy delivered and reflects the value the Company expects to receive for the energy transferred. Estimates of revenue expected to be recognized in future periods also exclude unexercised customer options to purchase additional goods or services that do not represent material rights to the customer.\nLEASES \n— The Company has operating and finance leases for energy production facilities, land, office space, transmission lines, vehicles and other operating equipment in which the Company is the lessee. The Company has elected an accounting policy, applied to all classes of assets, to not separate lease components from non-lease components where the Company is a lessee. Operating leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, but are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company’s leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees, restrictive covenants or subleases.\nRight-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized on commencement of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Generally, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable; as such, we use the subsidiaries’ incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives that are paid or payable to the lessee at commencement. The lease term includes the option to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\nThe Company has operating leases for certain generation contracts that contain provisions to provide capacity to a customer, which is a stand-ready obligation to deliver energy when required by the customer in which the Company is the lessor. Capacity payments are generally considered lease elements as they cover the majority of available output from a facility. The allocation of contract payments between the lease and non-lease elements is made at the inception of the lease. Fixed lease payments from such contracts are recognized as lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term, whereas variable lease payments are recognized when earned.\nThe Company has sales-type leases for BESS in which the Company is the lessor. These arrangements allow customers the ability to determine when to charge and discharge the BESS, representing the transfer of control and constitutes the arrangement as a sales-type lease. Upon commencement of the lease, the book value of the leased \n135 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nasset is removed from the balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type lease is recognized based on the present value of fixed payments under the contract and the residual value of the underlying asset.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION \n— The Company grants share-based compensation in the form of restricted stock units, performance stock units, performance cash units, and stock options. The expense is based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to its employees.\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES \n— General and administrative expenses include corporate and other expenses related to corporate staff functions and initiatives, primarily executive management, finance, legal, human resources, and information systems, which are not directly allocable to our business segments. Additionally, all costs associated with corporate business development efforts are classified as general and administrative expenses.\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES \n— Under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the Company recognizes all contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, except those designated as normal purchase or normal sale at inception, as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. See Note 5—\nFair Value\n and \nFair value\n in this section for additional discussion regarding the determination of fair value. \nPPAs and fuel supply agreements are evaluated to assess if they either meet the definition of a derivative or contain an embedded derivative requiring separate valuation and accounting. When available, the Company elects the normal purchase normal sale scope exception for these contracts.\nThe Company typically designates its derivative instruments as cash flow hedges if they meet the criteria specified in ASC 815. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge the variability of expected future cash interest payments. Foreign currency derivative contracts are primarily used to reduce risks arising from variability in forecasted cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies. The objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on operating results. The Company also enters into commodity futures, swaps and options to hedge price variability inherent in forecasted purchases and sales of electricity, fuels, and other commodities. The objectives of the commodity contracts are to minimize the impact of variability in spot commodity prices and stabilize estimated revenue and expense streams. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nFor our cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are deferred in AOCL and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions affect earnings. If a derivative is no longer highly effective, hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively. For cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, AES estimates the future cash flows of the forecasted transactions and evaluates the probability of the occurrence and timing of such transactions. \nChanges in the fair value of derivatives not designated and qualifying as accounting hedges are immediately recognized in earnings. Regardless of when gains or losses on derivatives are recognized in earnings, they are generally classified as interest expense for interest rate and cross-currency derivatives, foreign currency transaction gains or losses for foreign currency derivatives, and non-regulated revenue or non-regulated cost of sales for commodity and other derivatives. Cash flows arising from derivatives are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity given the nature of the underlying risk being economically hedged and the lack of significant financing elements, except that cash flows on designated and qualifying hedges of variable-rate interest during construction are classified as an investing activity. Cash payments and receipts to terminate interest rate derivatives prior to the end of their effective date are classified as an operating activity; however, they are excluded from the \nCash payments for interest, net of amounts capitalized\n supplementary disclosure on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These cash receipts totaled $\n187\n million, $\n181\n million, and $\n239\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023\n, \nand 2022, respectively. The Company has elected not to offset derivative positions on the balance sheet where a right to offset exists.\nCREDIT LOSSES \n—\n In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records an allowance for CECL for accounts and notes receivable, financing receivables, contract assets, net investments in leases recognized as a lessor, held-to-maturity debt securities, financial guarantees related to the non-payment of a financial obligation, and off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance. The Company has elected to write off accrued interest receivables by reversing interest income. The CECL allowance is based on the asset's amortized cost and reflects management's expected risk of credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the asset. CECL allowances are \n136 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nestimated using relevant information about the collectability of cash flows and considering information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.\n \nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n— \nThe following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that had an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Accounting pronouncements not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Standards Adopted\nASU Number and Name\nDescription\nDate of Adoption\nEffect on the financial statements upon adoption\n2022-04,Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 450-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\nThis update is to provide additional information and disclosures about an entity’s use of supplier finance programs to see how these programs will affect an entity’s working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. Entities that use supplier finance programs as the buyer party should disclose (1) the key terms of the payment terms and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided and (2) the unpaid amount outstanding, a description of where those obligations are presented on the balance sheet, and a rollforward of those obligations during the annual period.\nJanuary 1, 2023, except for the rollforward information, which was adopted December 31, 2024\nThe ASU only requires disclosures related to the Company's supplier finance programs and does not affect the recognition, measurement, or presentation of supplier finance program obligations on the balance sheet or cash flow statement. The Company adopted the new disclosure requirements in the first quarter of 2023, except for the annual requirement to disclose rollforward information, which the Company adopted and presented beginning in the 2024 annual financial statements. See Note 12—\nObligations \nfor impact.\n \n2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nThe amendments in this section are designed to improve the disclosures related to Segment reporting on an interim and annual basis. Public companies must disclose significant segment expenses and an amount for other segment items. This will also require that a company disclose its annual disclosures under Topic 280 in each interim period. Furthermore, companies will need to disclose the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) and how the CODM assesses the performance of a segment. Lastly, public companies that have a single reportable segment must report the required disclosures under topic 280.\nDecember 31, 2024\nThe Company adopted this standard on a retrospective basis. See Note 19\n—\nSegments and Geographic Information\n for impact\n137 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective \n— \nThe following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements once adopted. Accounting pronouncements not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective\nASU Number and Name\nDescription\nDate of Adoption\nEffect on the financial statements upon adoption\n2023-06 Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative\nIn U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, issued August 17, 2018, the SEC referred certain of its disclosure requirements that overlap with, but require incremental information to, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to the FASB for potential incorporation into the Codification. The amendments in this Update are the result of the Board’s decision to incorporate into the Codification 14 of the 27 disclosures referred by the SEC. \nThe amendments in this Update represent changes to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of Topics. Many of the amendments allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the SEC’s requirements. Also, the amendments align the requirements in the Codification with the SEC’s regulations.\nThe effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC's removal of that related disclosure becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively.\nThe Company will provide the required disclosures on a prospective basis on the date each amendment becomes effective. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-06 will have any impact to our consolidated financial statements.\n2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nThe amendments in this Update require that public business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. Furthermore, companies are required to disclose a disaggregated amount of income taxes paid at a federal, state, and foreign level as well as a breakdown of income taxes paid in a jurisdiction that comprises 5% of a company's total income taxes paid. Lastly, this ASU requires that companies disclose income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax at a domestic and foreign level and that companies disclose income tax expense from continuing operations on a federal, state, and foreign level.\nThe amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024\nThe Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n2024-03: Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\nThe amendments in this Update require disclosure, in the notes to financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses. The amendments require that at each interim and annual reporting period an entity:\n1. Disclose the amounts of (a) purchases of inventory, (b) employee compensation, (c) depreciation, (d) intangible asset amortization, and (e) depreciation, depletion, and amortization recognized as part of oil- and gas-producing activities (DD&A) (or other amounts of depletion expense) included in each relevant expense caption. A relevant expense caption is an expense caption presented on the face of the income statement within continuing operations that contains any of the expense categories listed in (a)–(e).\n2. Include certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed under current generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the same disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements.\n3. Disclose a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively.\n4. Disclose the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses.\nThe date for each amendment in this Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted\nThe Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n2024-04: Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)\nThe amendments in this Update clarify the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion.\nThe date for each amendment in this Update is effective beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods.\nThe Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n138 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n2. \nINVENTORY\n Inventory is valued primarily using the average-cost method. \nThe following table summarizes the Company's inventory balances as of the dates indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nFuel and other raw materials\n$\n246\n \n$\n424\n \nSpare parts and supplies\n347\n \n288\n \nTotal\n$\n593\n \n$\n712\n \n3. \nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following table summarizes the components of property, plant and equipment (in millions) with their estimated useful lives (in years).

See Note 11—\nR\negulatory\n Assets and Liabilities\n for further information.\nThe Company's asset retirement obligations include active ash landfills, water treatment basins, and the removal or dismantlement of certain plants and equipment. The Company uses the expected cash flow technique to determine the initial value of ARO liabilities, which is estimated by discounting expected cash outflows to their present value using market-based rates at the initial recording of the liabilities. Cash outflows are based on the approximate future disposal costs as determined by market information, historical information, or other management estimates. Subsequent downward revisions of ARO liabilities are discounted using the market-based rates that existed when the liability was initially recognized. These inputs to the fair value of the ARO liabilities are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company increased the asset retirement obligations and corresponding assets at AES Indiana and AES Clean Energy by $\n129\n million and $\n73\n million, respectively. The increase at AES Indiana is primarily related to revisions to cash flow estimates due to increases in closure costs and groundwater treatment measures for ash ponds and landfills. The increase at AES Clean Energy is mostly due to additional liabilities incurred for sites that were placed in service during 2024. This was offset by decreases at Ventanas of $\n43\n million due to held-for-sale classification in December 2024, and $\n15\n million at AES Brasil due to the sale of the business in October 2024.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company increased the asset retirement obligations and corresponding assets at AES Clean Energy and AES Indiana by $\n43\n million and $\n34\n million, respectively. This was offset by decreases at Southland Energy and AES Brasil of $\n51\n million and $\n20\n million, respectively. The increase at AES Clean Energy is mostly due to an upward revision of estimated cash flows as a result of a decommissioning study done in the fourth quarter of 2023, which mostly impacted the estimated cash flows related to solar assets. The increase at AES Indiana is mostly due to additional liabilities incurred due to revised remediation plans for ash ponds at Eagle Valley and AES Indiana's solar projects. The decrease at Southland Energy is mostly due to a downward revision of estimated cash flows as a result of revised quotes from vendors for the demolition of the Southland legacy units. The decrease at AES Brasil is mostly due to a downward revision of estimated cash flows at the Mandacaru, Salinas, and Cubico II wind complexes and AES Brasil solar facilities.\n5. \nFAIR VALUE\nThe fair value of current financial assets and liabilities, debt service reserves, and other deposits approximate their reported carrying amounts. The estimated fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities have been determined using available market information. Because these amounts are estimates and based on hypothetical transactions to sell assets or transfer liabilities, the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. \nValuation Techniques \n—\n \nThe fair value measurement accounting guidance describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: (1) market approach, (2) income approach, and (3) cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount. The measurement is based on current market expectations of the return on those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset. The Company measures its investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, in connection with annual or event-driven impairment evaluations, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include long-lived tangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment), goodwill, and intangible assets (e.g., sales concessions, land use rights and water rights, etc.). In general, the Company determines the fair value of investments and derivatives using the market approach \n140 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nand the income approach, respectively. In the nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, all three approaches are considered; however, the value estimated under the income approach is often the most representative of fair value. \nInvestments \n— The Company's investments measured at fair value generally consist of marketable debt and equity securities. Equity securities are either measured at fair value using quoted market prices or based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets. Debt securities primarily consist of government debt securities and certificates of deposit held by foreign subsidiaries. Debt securities are measured at fair value based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets.\n \nDerivatives \n— Derivatives are measured at fair value using quoted market prices or the income approach utilizing spot and forward benchmark interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, volatilities and credit data, as applicable. When significant inputs are not observable, the Company uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regression analysis or prices for similarly traded instruments available in the market. \nThe Company's methodology to fair value its derivatives is to start with any observable inputs; however, in certain instances the published forward rates or prices may not extend through the remaining term of the contract, and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve, which necessitates the use of unobservable inputs, such as proxy commodity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices. With respect to credit inputs, in certain instances the spread that reflects the credit or nonperformance risk is unobservable, requiring the use of proxy yield curves of similar credit quality.\nTo determine the fair value of a derivative, cash flows are discounted using the relevant spot benchmark interest rate. The Company then makes a credit valuation adjustment (\"CVA\"), as applicable, by further discounting the cash flows for nonperformance or credit risk based on the observable or estimated debt spread of the Company's subsidiary or its counterparty and the tenor of the respective derivative instrument. The CVA for potential future scenarios in which the derivative is in an asset position is based on the counterparty's credit ratings, credit default swap spreads, and debt spreads, as available. The CVA for potential future scenarios in which the derivative is in a liability position is based on the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's current debt spread. In the absence of readily obtainable credit information, the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's estimated credit rating and spreads of comparably rated entities or the respective country's debt spreads are used as a proxy. All derivative instruments are analyzed individually and are subject to unique risk exposures. \nThe fair value hierarchy of an asset or a liability is based on the level of significance of the input assumptions. An input assumption is considered significant if it affects the fair value by at least 10%. Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 when the use of unobservable inputs is significant. When the use of unobservable inputs is insignificant, assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2. Transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 result from changes in significance of unobservable inputs used to calculate the CVA. \nContingent consideration \n— Contingent consideration is primarily related to future milestone payments associated with acquisitions of renewables development projects. The estimated fair value of contingent consideration is determined using probability-weighted discounted cash flows based on internal forecasts, which are considered Level 3 inputs. Changes in Level 3 inputs, particularly changes in the probability of achieving development milestones, could result in material changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of expense or income recorded each reporting period. Contingent consideration is updated quarterly with any prospective changes in fair value recorded through earnings. Gains and losses on the remeasurement of contingent consideration are recognized in \nOther income\n and \nOther expense\n, respectively.\nDebt \n— Recourse and non-recourse debt are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of recourse debt is estimated based on quoted market prices. The fair value of non-recourse debt is estimated based upon interest rates and other features of the loan. In general, the carrying amount of variable rate debt is a close approximation of its fair value. For fixed rate loans, the fair value is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analyses. The fair value of recourse and non-recourse debt excludes accrued interest at the valuation date. The fair value was determined using available market information as of December 31, 2024. The Company is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts subsequent to December 31, 2024.\nNonrecurring measurements \n—\n \nFor nonrecurring measurements derived using the income approach, fair value is generally determined using valuation models based on the principles of DCF. The income approach is most often used in the impairment evaluation of long-lived tangible assets, equity method investments, goodwill, and intangible assets. Where the use of market observable data is limited or not available for certain input assumptions, the \n141 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nCompany develops its own estimates using a variety of techniques such as regression analysis and extrapolations. Depending on the complexity of a valuation, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to assist management in the valuation process.\nFor nonrecurring measurements derived using the market approach, recent market transactions involving the sale of identical or similar assets are considered. The use of this approach is limited because it is often difficult to identify sale transactions of identical or similar assets. This approach is used in impairment evaluations of certain intangible assets. Otherwise, it is used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach. \nFor nonrecurring measurements derived using the cost approach, fair value is typically based upon a replacement cost approach. This approach involves a considerable amount of judgment, which is why its use is limited to the measurement of long-lived tangible assets. Like the market approach, this approach is also used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach. \nFair Value Considerations \n— In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observable market data inputs, liquidity of the instrument, the credit risk of the counterparty, and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria used to assess these factors are: \nSources of market assumptions \n— The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions. \nMarket liquidity \n— The Company evaluates market liquidity based on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset, is traded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume, and the market has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded without significantly affecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining whether a market is active or inactive is the presence of government or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-based price when entering into a transaction. \nNonperformance risk \n— Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation will not be fulfilled and affects the value at which a liability is transferred or an asset is sold. Nonperformance risk includes, but may not be limited to, the Company's or its counterparty's credit and settlement risk. Nonperformance risk adjustments are dependent on credit spreads, letters of credit, collateral, other arrangements available, and the nature of master netting arrangements. The Company is party to various interest rate swaps and options, foreign currency options and forwards, and derivatives and embedded derivatives, which subject the Company to nonperformance risk. The financial and physical instruments held at the subsidiary level are generally non-recourse to the Parent Company. \nNonperformance risk on the investments held by the Company is incorporated in the fair value derived from quoted market data to mark the investments to fair value. \nRecurring Measurements\n — \nThe following table presents, by level within the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 1—\nGeneral and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, \nthe Company's financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated (in millions). For the Company's investments in marketable debt securities, the security classes presented were determined based on the nature and risk of the security and are consistent with how the Company manages, monitors, and measures its marketable securities:\n142 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\nDEBT SECURITIES:\nAvailable-for-sale:\nCertificates of deposit\n$\n—\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n360\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n360\n \nGovernment debt securities\n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal debt securities\n—\n \n8\n \n—\n \n8\n \n—\n \n360\n \n—\n \n360\n \nEQUITY SECURITIES:\nMutual funds\n51\n \n—\n \n—\n \n51\n \n46\n \n—\n \n—\n \n46\n \nCommon stock\n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal equity securities\n55\n \n—\n \n—\n \n55\n \n46\n \n—\n \n—\n \n46\n \nDERIVATIVES:\nInterest rate derivatives\n—\n \n349\n \n—\n \n349\n \n—\n \n182\n \n2\n \n184\n \nForeign currency derivatives\n—\n \n9\n \n52\n \n61\n \n—\n \n15\n \n59\n \n74\n \nCommodity derivatives\n193\n \n80\n \n5\n \n278\n \n—\n \n127\n \n1\n \n128\n \nTotal derivatives — assets\n193\n \n438\n \n57\n \n688\n \n—\n \n324\n \n62\n \n386\n \nTOTAL ASSETS\n$\n248\n \n$\n446\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n751\n \n$\n46\n \n$\n684\n \n$\n62\n \n$\n792\n \nLiabilities\nContingent consideration\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n145\n \n$\n145\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n165\n \n$\n165\n \nDERIVATIVES:\nInterest rate derivatives\n—\n \n14\n \n1\n \n15\n \n—\n \n102\n \n6\n \n108\n \nCross-currency derivatives\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n63\n \n—\n \n63\n \nForeign currency derivatives\n—\n \n18\n \n—\n \n18\n \n—\n \n19\n \n—\n \n19\n \nCommodity derivatives\n185\n \n44\n \n26\n \n255\n \n—\n \n145\n \n111\n \n256\n \nTotal derivatives — liabilities\n185\n \n76\n \n27\n \n288\n \n—\n \n329\n \n117\n \n446\n \nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n$\n185\n \n$\n76\n \n$\n172\n \n$\n433\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n329\n \n$\n282\n \n$\n611\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, all available-for-sale debt securities had stated maturities within one year.

The anticipated collection period extends beyond December 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2023, a significant financing receivable existed for the Warrior Run PPA termination agreement where $\n108\n million was recorded in \nOther non-current assets\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On February 1, 2024, the Company executed an agreement to sell all remaining future cash flows under the termination agreement. At the time of execution, the transaction was considered a sale of future revenue under U.S. GAAP. Upon completion of the remaining performance obligation in May 2024, the corresponding receivable balance of $\n267\n million, net of valuation allowance of $\n7\n million, was derecognized\n.\n See Note 21—\nRevenue\n \nfor further details regarding the Warrior Run PPA termination agreement.\nChile —\n AES Andes has recorded receivables pertaining to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by the Stabilization Funds created by the Chilean government in October 2019, August 2022, and April 2024, in conjunction with the Tariff Stabilization Laws. Historically, the government updated the prices for these contracts every six months to reflect the contracts' indexation to exchange rates and commodities prices. The Tariff Stabilization Laws do not allow the pass-through of these contractual indexation updates to customers beyond the pricing in effect at July 1, 2019, until new lower-cost renewables contracts are incorporated to supply regulated contracts. Consequently, costs incurred in excess of the July 1, 2019 price were \n148 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\naccumulated and borne by generators. As of December 31, 2024, AES Andes aimed to reduce its exposure through the sale of receivables.\nThrough different agreements and programs, as of December 31, 2024 AES Andes sold and collected $\n151\n million and $\n217\n million related to agreements executed in August 2023 and October 2024 to sell up to $\n227\n million and $\n254\n million of receivables pursuant to the Stabilization Funds, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, $\n8\n million of current receivables and $\n5\n million of noncurrent receivables were recorded in \nAccounts receivable\n and \nOther noncurrent assets\n, respectively. Additionally, $\n39\n million of payment deferrals granted to mining customers as part of our green blend agreements were recorded as financing receivables included in \nOther noncurrent assets \nat December 31, 2024.\n8. \nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe following table represents the rollforward of the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated (in millions):\nTwelve Months Ended \nDecember 31, 2024\nAccounts Receivable\nMong Duong Loan Receivable \n(1)\nArgentina Receivables\nOther \n(2)\nTotal\nCECL reserve balance at beginning of period\n$\n15\n \n$\n25\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n64\n \nCurrent period provision\n43\n \n—\n \n—\n \n15\n \n58\n \nWrite-offs charged against allowance\n(\n7\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n6\n)\n(\n13\n)\nRecoveries collected\n1\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nAllowance derecognized due to disposal of a business\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n7\n)\n(\n7\n)\nForeign exchange\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n5\n)\nCECL reserve balance at end of period\n$\n52\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n96\n \nTwelve Months Ended \nDecember 31, 2023\nAccounts Receivable \nMong Duong Loan Receivable \n(1)\nArgentina Receivables\nLease Receivable \n(3)\nOther\nTotal\nCECL reserve balance at beginning of period\n$\n3\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n30\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n83\n \nCurrent period provision\n23\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n17\n \n40\n \nWrite-offs charged against allowance\n(\n15\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n20\n)\n—\n \n(\n35\n)\nRecoveries collected\n2\n \n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nForeign exchange\n2\n \n—\n \n(\n23\n)\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n23\n)\nCECL reserve balance at end of period\n$\n15\n \n$\n25\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n64\n \n_____________________________\n(1)\nMong Duong loan receivable credit losses allowance was classified in\n \nheld-for-sale assets\n \non the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n(2)\nPrimarily relates to credit losses allowance on financing receivables in the U.S. and credit losses allowance at AES Brasil which was sold on October 31, 2024.\n(3)\nLease receivable credit losses allowance at Southland Energy (AES Gilbert).\nDuring 2024, the current period provision and allowance for credit losses on customer accounts receivable increased due to a temporary pause of customer disconnections and certain collection efforts and write-off processes after the implementation of customer billing system upgrades at our utilities.

Furthermore, there are two specific portfolios of operating solar and wind assets, OpCo A and OpCo B, in which sPower, LLC owns \n51\n%, resulting in an AES effective ownership of approximately \n26\n% in these portfolios.\n(2)\nThe Company's ownership in Grupo Energía Gas Panamá is held through AES Panama, a \n49\n%-owned consolidated subsidiary. AES Panama owns \n49\n% of Grupo Energía Gas Panamá, resulting in an AES effective ownership of \n24\n%.\n(3)\nThe Company's ownership in Energía Natural Dominicana Enadom is held through Andres, a \n65\n%-owned consolidated subsidiary. Andres owns \n50\n% of Energía Natural Dominicana Enadom, resulting in an AES effective ownership of \n33\n%.\n(4)\nIncludes Bosforo, Jordan, Barry, Alto Maipo, and various other equity method investments. Barry and Alto Maipo represent VIEs in which the Company holds a variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary.\nJordan —\n In March 2024, the Company completed the sale of approximately \n26\n% ownership interest in Amman East and IPP4 for a sale price of $\n58\n million. After adjusting for dividends received since the execution of the sale and purchase agreement, the Company received a net cash payment of $\n45\n million. After completion of the sale, the Company retained \n10\n% ownership interest in each of the businesses, which are accounted for as equity method investments. See Note 25—\nHeld-for-Sale and Dispositions \nfor further information. Amman East and IPP4 are reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nUplight\n \n—\n In February 2024, Uplight acquired AutoGrid, a market leader in the Virtual Power Plant space, from Schneider Electric. As part of the transaction, Schneider contributed an additional $\n40\n million to Uplight, and Uplight issued approximately \n91\n million additional common units to Schneider as consideration for the acquisition. No incremental investment was required from AES or any other investor. As a result, AES' \n29\n% ownership interest in Uplight was diluted to \n25\n%. The transaction was accounted for as a partial disposition in which AES recognized a gain of $\n52\n million in \nGain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests\n upon remeasurement. As the Company still does not control but has significant influence over Uplight after the transaction, it continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment and is reported in the New Energy Technologies SBU reportable segment.\nFluence\n \n— \nIn December 2023, the Company redeemed \n7,087,500\n common units of Fluence Energy, LLC. Fluence Energy, Inc. settled this redemption through the issuance of an equivalent number of shares of its Class A common stock. In conjunction with this redemption, the Company executed a public sale of the Class A shares, resulting in proceeds received of $\n156\n million, after expenses, and a pre-tax gain on sale of $\n136\n million, recorded in \nGain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests\n. As a result of this transaction, AES' ownership interest decreased from \n33\n% to \n29\n%. As the Company still does not control but has significant influence over Fluence after the transaction, it continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment. Fluence is reported in the New Energy Technologies SBU reportable segment.\nGrupo Energía Gas Panamá\n \n— \nIn September 2023, AES Latin America completed the sale of its interest in Grupo Energía Gas Panamá, a joint venture formed for the Gatun combined cycle natural gas development project, to AES Panama, a \n49\n%-owned consolidated subsidiary. As a result of the transaction, the Company’s effective ownership in Grupo Energía Gas Panamá decreased from \n49\n% to approximately \n24\n%. As the Company still does not control the investment after this transaction, it continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment and is reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nsPower — \nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to sell \n49\n% of its indirect interest in a portfolio of sPower's operating assets (\"OpCo B\"). At the time the purchase and sale agreement was signed, a loss was expected upon closing the transaction. The expected loss on sale was identified as a triggering event and the Company evaluated whether its investment in sPower was other-than-temporarily impaired. Based on management’s estimate of fair \n150 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nvalue of $\n432\n million, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of $\n175\n million in \nOther non-operating expense\n in December 2022.\nsPower primarily holds operating assets where the tax credits associated with underlying projects have already been allocated to tax equity investors. The application of HLBV accounting increases the carrying value of these investments, as earnings are initially disproportionately allocated to the sponsor entity. Since sPower does not have any ongoing development or other value creation activities following the transfer of these activities to AES Clean Energy Development, the impairment adjusts the carrying value to the fair market value of the operating assets.\nOn February 28, 2023, sPower closed on the sale for $\n196\n million. As a result of the transaction, the Company received $\n98\n million in sales proceeds and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $\n5\n million, recorded in \nGain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests\n. After the sale, the Company's ownership interest in OpCo B decreased from \n50\n% to approximately \n26\n%. As the Company still does not control but has significant influence over sPower after the transaction, it continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment. sPower is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nAlto Maipo — \nIn May 2022, Alto Maipo emerged from bankruptcy in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Alto Maipo, as restructured, is considered a VIE. As the Company lacks the power to make significant decisions, it does not meet the criteria to be considered the primary beneficiary of Alto Maipo and therefore will not consolidate the entity. The Company has elected the fair value option to account for its investment in Alto Maipo as management believes this approach will better reflect the economics of its equity interest. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value is insignificant. Alto Maipo is reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nBarry \n— The Company holds a \n100\n% ownership interest in AES Barry Ltd. (\"Barry\"), a dormant entity in the U.K. that disposed of its generation and other operating assets. Due to a debt agreement, no material financial or operating decisions can be made without the banks' consent, and the Company does not control Barry. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, other long-term liabilities included $\n41\n million related to this debt agreement.

The fair value of the reporting unit was determined under the income approach using a discounted cash flow valuation model. The estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount and as a result the Company recognized impairment expense of $\n12\n million, reducing the goodwill balance of TEG TEP to zero. The decrease in fair value since the date of our last impairment test on July 31, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate due to increasing risk of non-renewal of operating permits required to operate after March 31, 2024. In 2024, TEG and TEP successfully migrated to the new energy regime and currently operate according to ISO instructions. TEG and TEP are reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nAES Andes — \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test for the AES Andes reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined under the income approach using a discounted cash flow valuation model.\n \nThe estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount and as a result the Company recognized impairment expense of $\n644\n million, reducing the goodwill balance of AES Andes to zero. The decrease in fair value since the date of our last impairment test was primarily driven by a higher discount rate resulting from increased interest rates and country risk premiums, as well as a decrease in forecasted energy prices and other unfavorable macroeconomic assumptions in Colombia. AES Andes is reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nAES El Salvador\n — During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test for the El Salvador reporting unit. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test and utilized the income approach. The estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount and as a result the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $\n133\n million, reducing the goodwill balance of AES El Salvador to zero. Since the date of our last impairment test in 2021, the Company had seen market participants substantially increase return expectations for the perceived country risk for El Salvador. The impact of the increase has substantially increased our discount rate, resulting in a full impairment. AES El Salvador is reported in the Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nOther Intangible Assets \n— \nThe following table summarizes the balances comprising \nOther intangible assets\n in the

The net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay existing indebtedness, including its unsecured $\n300\n million term loan due in November 2024 and amounts outstanding under its $\n350\n million revolving credit agreement maturing in December 2027, and for general corporate purposes at AES Indiana. \nIn March 2024, IPALCO issued $\n400\n million aggregate principal of \n5.75\n% senior secured notes due April 2034. In April 2024, the net proceeds from this issuance, together with cash on hand, were used to redeem the outstanding $\n405\n million of IPALCO’s \n3.70\n% senior secured notes due in September 2024.\nIn November 2023, AES Indiana executed a $\n300\n million term loan due in 2024. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes at AES Indiana. The term loan was repaid in March 2024.\nAES Andes — \nIn March 2024, AES Andes issued $\n500\n million aggregate principal of \n6.30\n% senior unsecured notes due in 2029. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to purchase via tender offer $\n100\n million and $\n43\n million aggregate principal of its \n6.35\n% and \n5.00\n% notes due in 2079 and 2025, respectively, and repay other existing indebtedness.\nIn June 2024, AES Andes issued $\n530\n million in Junior Subordinated Notes at \n8.15\n%, due in 2055. The proceeds were used to repay its \n7.125\n% notes due in 2079. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n8\n million.\nAES Puerto Rico — \nOn June 1, 2023, AES Puerto Rico was unable to pay principal and interest obligations on its Series A Bond Loans due to insufficient funds resulting from financial difficulties at the business. AES Puerto Rico signed forbearance and standstill agreements with its noteholders in July 2023 because of the insufficiency of funds to meet these obligations. On March 5, 2024, AES Puerto Rico and its noteholders executed a financial restructuring, under which the $\n156\n million (including interest) of \n6.625\n% Series A Bond Loans due 2026 was exchanged for $\n112\n million of \n6.625\n% senior secured bonds due January 2028 and $\n44\n million of preferred shares in AES Puerto Rico. The preferred shares bear interest at \n3.125\n% and contains an option whereby AES may call the preferred shares to be converted into \n99.9\n% of the ordinary shares of AES Puerto Rico between December 30, 2025 and December 30, 2027, or would have the option to settle the preferred shares in cash. The noteholders also provided a $\n23\n million bridge loan due March 2026 bearing interest at prime plus \n4\n%. AES Puerto Rico is required to make mandatory prepayments through cash sweeps based on excess cash (as defined in the loan agreements) available from operations on the bridge loan, senior secured bonds, and preferred shares interest. The financial restructuring was accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring in accordance with ASC 470-60, “\nTroubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors” \nas AES Puerto Rico was experiencing financial difficulties and the lenders granted a concession. No gain was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024 as a result of this transaction. As of December 31, 2024, cash settlement of the preferred shares is contingent, as the amounts would not be required to be settled in cash if the option to settle the preferred shares with common shares is exercised.\n157 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nAES Ohio — \nIn December 2023, AES Ohio issued $\n200\n million of First Mortgage Bonds in a private placement offering, in which $\n92\n million aggregate principal of \n5.49\n% bonds and $\n108\n million aggregate principal of \n5.70\n% bonds due in 2028 and 2033, respectively, were issued. The net proceeds from the issuances were used primarily to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes at AES Ohio.\nNetherlands and Colon — \nIn January 2023, AES Hispanola Holdings BV and Colon, as co-borrowers, executed a $\n350\n million credit agreement at \n8.85\n%, due in 2028. The Company allocated $\n300\n million and $\n50\n million of the proceeds from the agreement to AES Hispanola Holdings BV and Colon, respectively. The net proceeds from the agreement were used to partially repay the $\n500\n million bridge loan executed in 2022. The remaining principal outstanding of the bridge loan was repaid with proceeds from operating cash flows as well as cash from the Parent Company. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n1\n million.\nNon-Recourse Debt Covenants, Restrictions and Defaults \n— The terms of the Company's non-recourse debt include certain financial and nonfinancial covenants. These covenants are limited to subsidiary activity and vary among the subsidiaries. These covenants may include, but are not limited to, maintenance of certain reserves and financial ratios, minimum levels of working capital and limitations on incurring additional indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $\n147\n million and $\n341\n million, respectively, of restricted cash was maintained in accordance with certain covenants of the non-recourse debt agreements. Of these amounts, $\n79\n million and $\n158\n million, respectively, were included within \nRestricted cash\n and $\n68\n million and $\n183\n million, respectively, were included within \nDebt service reserves and other deposits\n in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $\n155\n million and $\n90\n million, respectively, of the restricted cash balances were for collateral held to cover potential liability for current and future insurance claims being assumed by AGIC, AES' captive insurance company. Of total restricted cash and debt service reserves of $\n515\n million, $\n245\n million related to VIEs as of December 31, 2024.\nVarious lender and governmental provisions restrict the ability of certain of the Company's subsidiaries to transfer their net assets to the Parent Company. Such restricted net assets of subsidiaries amounted to approximately $\n885\n million at December 31, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's subsidiary non-recourse debt in default (in millions) as of December 31, 2024. Due to the defaults, these amounts are included in the current portion of non-recourse debt:\nPrimary Nature\nof Default\nDecember 31, 2024\nSubsidiary\nDebt in Default\nNet Assets (Liabilities)\nAES Dominican Renewable Energy\n (1)\nCovenant\n$\n354\n \n$\n88\n \nAES Puerto Rico\nPayment\n158\n \n(\n416\n)\nAES Ilumina (Puerto Rico)\nCovenant\n22\n \n30\n \nAES Jordan Solar\nCovenant\n6\n \n12\n \nTotal\n$\n540\n \n_____________________________\n(1)\nOn February 6, 2025, AES Dominican Renewable Energy failed to comply with a covenant on its debt, resulting in a technical default. AES Dominican Renewable Energy is classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2024, therefore the associated non-recourse debt is classified in \nCurrent held-for-sale liabilities\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAES Puerto Rico is in payment default on its long-term debt and preferred shares due to failure to implement the cash sweep mechanism in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. AES Puerto Rico is working with the noteholders to resolve this matter. All other subsidiary defaults listed are not payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with covenants or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents of the applicable subsidiary.\nAES Mexico Generation Holdings (TEG and TEP) — \nIn December 2024, AES Mexico Generation Holdings executed an amendment to the original credit agreement with its noteholders, obtaining waivers for prior covenant default events through June 30, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the AES Mexico Generation Holdings debt balance of $\n128\n million was not in default.\nThe AES Corporation's recourse debt agreements include cross-default clauses that will trigger if a subsidiary provides \n20\n% or more of the Parent Company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters and has an outstanding principal in excess of $\n200\n million in default. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's subsidiaries had \nno\n defaults which resulted in a cross-default under the recourse debt of the Parent Company. In the event the Parent Company is not in compliance with the financial covenants of its revolving \n158 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\ncredit facilities, restricted payments will be limited to regular quarterly shareholder dividends at the then-prevailing rate. Payment defaults and bankruptcy defaults would preclude the making of any restricted payments.\nRECOURSE DEBT \n— Recourse debt represents debt that the Parent Company has an obligation to settle. This can be debt issued directly by the Parent Company or debt issued by a subsidiary under which the Parent Company has explicit commitments such as guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, or agreements to settle if the subsidiary defaults. \nThe following table summarizes the carrying amount and terms of recourse debt as of the periods indicated (in millions):\nInterest Rate\nFinal Maturity\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nSenior Variable Rate Term Loan\nSOFR + 1.125\n%\n2024\n$\n—\n \n$\n200\n \nSenior Unsecured Note\n3.30\n%\n2025\n900\n \n900\n \nSenior Unsecured Note\n1.375\n%\n2026\n800\n \n800\n \nSenior Unsecured Note\n5.45\n%\n2028\n900\n \n900\n \nSenior Unsecured Note\n3.95\n%\n2030\n700\n \n700\n \nSenior Unsecured Note\n2.45\n%\n2031\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \nJunior Unsecured Note\n7.60\n%\n2055\n950\n \n—\n \nJunior Unsecured Note\n6.95\n%\n2055\n500\n \n—\n \nUnamortized (discount) premium & debt issuance (costs), net\n(\n46\n)\n(\n36\n)\nSubtotal\n$\n5,704\n \n$\n4,464\n \nLess: Current maturities\n(\n899\n)\n(\n200\n)\nNoncurrent maturities\n$\n4,805\n \n$\n4,264\n \nThe following table summarizes the principal amounts due under our recourse debt for the next five years and thereafter (in millions):\nDecember 31,\nAnnual Maturities\n2025\n$\n900\n \n2026\n800\n \n2027\n—\n \n2028\n900\n \n2029\n—\n \nThereafter\n3,150\n \nUnamortized (discount) premium & debt issuance (costs), net\n(\n46\n)\nTotal recourse debt\n$\n5,704\n \nSubordinated Notes due January 2055\n — In May 2024, the Company issued $\n950\n million aggregate principal of \n7.60\n% fixed-to-fixed reset rate subordinated notes due in January 2055. AES allocates the net proceeds from this offering to one or more eligible green projects, which may include the development or redevelopment of such projects. Pending such allocation, the net proceeds from the offering are used for general corporate purposes.\nSubordinated Notes due July 2055\n — In December 2024, the Company issued $\n500\n million aggregate principal of \n6.95\n% fixed-to-fixed reset rate subordinated notes due in July 2055. AES utilized the net proceeds from this offering to repay existing indebtedness, including borrowings under the revolving facility of its senior credit facility and commercial paper program.\nSenior Notes due 2028 \n— In May 2023, the Company issued $\n900\n million aggregate principal of \n5.45\n% senior notes due in 2028. The Company used the proceeds from this issuance for general corporate purposes and to fund investments in the Company’s Renewables and Utilities SBUs.\nAES Clean Energy Development — \nIn March 2023, AES Clean Energy Development Holdings, LLC executed a $\n500\n million bridge loan due in December 2023 and used the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The obligations under the bridge loan were unsecured and fully guaranteed by the Parent Company. The bridge loan was repaid in December 2023.\n159 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nCommercial Paper Program\n \n—\n In March 2023, the Company established a commercial paper program under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) up to a maximum aggregate face amount of $\n750\n million outstanding at any time. The maturities of the Notes may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. The proceeds of the Notes will be used for general corporate purposes. The Notes will be sold on customary terms in the U.S. commercial paper market on a private placement basis. The commercial paper program is backed by the Company's $\n1.8\n billion in revolving credit facilities, and the Company cannot issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount exceeding the then available capacity under its revolving credit facilities. During \n2024\n, the Company borrowed and repaid approximately $\n57.9\n billion under the commercial paper program, with average daily outstanding borrowings of $\n611\n million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\n \n—\n In December 2024, AES executed a $\n300\n million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, maturing in December 2026. The aggregate commitment under its previously existing revolving credit facility is $\n1.5\n billion and matures in August 2027. As of December 31, 2024, AES had no outstanding drawings under either of its revolving credit facilities.\nRecourse Debt Covenants and Guarantees \n— The Company's obligations under the indentures governing the senior notes due 2025 and 2030 are currently unsecured following the achievement of two investment grade ratings and the release of security in accordance with the terms of the facility and the notes. If the Company’s credit rating falls below \"Investment Grade\" from at least two of Fitch Investors Service Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., as determined in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility and indenture dated May 15, 2020 (BBB-, or in the case of Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. Baa3), then the obligations under the indentures governing the senior notes due 2025 and 2030 become, subject to certain exceptions, secured by (i) all of the capital stock of domestic subsidiaries owned directly by the Company or certain subsidiaries and \n65\n% of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries owned directly by the Company and certain subsidiaries, and (ii) certain intercompany receivables, certain intercompany notes, and certain intercompany tax sharing agreements.\nEach revolving credit facility contains customary covenants and restrictions on the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, including, but not limited to, limitations on liens; restrictions on mergers and acquisitions and the disposition of assets; and other financial reporting requirements.\nEach revolving credit facility also contains one financial covenant, evaluated quarterly, requiring the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of recourse debt to adjusted operating cash flow of \n5.75\n times.\nThe terms of the Company's senior notes contain certain customary covenants, including limitations on the Company's ability to incur liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nSUPPLIER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS \n— With some purchases, the Company enters into supplier financing arrangements with the goal of securing improved payment terms. The Company confirms supplier invoices to an intermediary financial institution who will pay the supplier directly or reimburse the Company for payments made to the supplier. These arrangements are included in \nSupplier financing arrangements\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in \nCurrent liabilities\n as the amounts are all due in less than a year; the related interest expense is recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within \nInterest expense\n. These agreements ranged from less than $\n1\n million to $\n69\n million with a weighted average interest rate of \n6.83\n% and \n7.51\n% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the amounts outstanding under supplier financing arrangements, $\n616\n million and $\n814\n million were guaranteed by the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table shows a rollforward for outstanding supplier financing arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\n2024\n2023\nBalance at January 1\n$\n974\n \n$\n662\n \nInvoices confirmed during the year\n1,737\n \n1,907\n \nConfirmed invoices paid during the year\n(\n1,794\n)\n(\n1,595\n)\nBalance at December 31\n$\n917\n \n$\n974\n \n160 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n13. \nCOMMITMENTS\nThe Company enters into long-term contracts for construction projects, maintenance and service, transmission of electricity, operations services and purchases of electricity and fuel. In general, these contracts are subject to variable quantities or prices and are terminable only in limited circumstances. \nThe following table shows the future minimum commitments for continuing operations under these contracts as of December 31, 2024 for 2025 through 2029 and thereafter as well as actual purchases under these contracts for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (in millions):\nActual purchases during the year ended December 31,\nElectricity Purchase Contracts\nFuel Purchase Contracts\nOther Purchase Contracts\n2022\n$\n1,156\n \n$\n3,375\n \n$\n3,602\n \n2023\n1,134\n \n1,982\n \n3,181\n \n2024\n797\n \n1,869\n \n3,507\n \nFuture commitments for the year ending December 31,\n2025\n$\n759\n \n$\n1,701\n \n$\n2,485\n \n2026\n731\n \n1,005\n \n262\n \n2027\n660\n \n774\n \n192\n \n2028\n648\n \n528\n \n140\n \n2029\n640\n \n474\n \n142\n \nThereafter\n5,484\n \n1,259\n \n892\n \nTotal\n$\n8,922\n \n$\n5,741\n \n$\n4,113\n \n14. \nCONTINGENCIES \nParent Guarantees and Letters of Credit\n \n—\n \nIn connection with certain project financings (including tax equity transactions), acquisitions and dispositions, power purchases, EPC contracts, and other agreements, the Parent Company has expressly undertaken limited obligations and commitments, most of which will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. In the normal course of business, the Parent Company has entered into various agreements, mainly guarantees and letters of credit, to provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of AES businesses. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise achieved by a business on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the availability of sufficient credit to accomplish their intended business purposes. Most of the contingent obligations relate to future performance commitments which the Company or its businesses expect to fulfill within the normal course of business. The expiration dates of these guarantees vary from less than 1 year to no more than 32 years.\nThe following table summarizes the Parent Company's contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024. Amounts presented in the following table represent the Parent Company's current undiscounted exposure to guarantees and the range of maximum undiscounted potential exposure per individual agreement. The maximum exposure is not reduced by the amounts, if any, that could be recovered under the recourse or collateralization provisions in the guarantees. \nContingent Contractual Obligations\nMaximum Exposure (in millions)\nNumber of Agreements\nMaximum Exposure Range for Each Agreement (in millions)\nGuarantees and commitments\n$\n3,040\n \n89\n< $\n1\n — \n350\nLetters of credit under bilateral agreements\n378\n \n9\n$\n11\n — \n88\nLetters of credit under the unsecured credit facilities\n129\n \n28\n< $\n1\n — \n50\nLetters of credit under the revolving credit facilities\n18\n \n9\n< $\n1\n — \n4\nSurety bonds\n2\n \n2\n< $\n1\n — \n1\nTotal\n$\n3,567\n \n137\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Parent Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from \n1\n% to \n3\n% per annum on the outstanding amounts of letters of credit.\nSubsidiary Guarantees and Letters of Credit\n \n— In connection with certain project financings (including tax equity transactions), acquisitions and dispositions, power purchases, EPC contracts, and other agreements, certain of the Company's subsidiaries have expressly undertaken limited obligations and commitments, most of which will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events, or are customary payment guarantees for amounts due under existing contracts in the normal course of business. These contingent contractual obligations are issued at the subsidiary level and are non-recourse to the Parent Company. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum undiscounted potential exposure to guarantees and letters of credit issued by our subsidiaries was $\n5.3\n billion, including $\n2.2\n billion of customary payment guarantees under EPC contracts and other agreements, $\n1.4\n \n161 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nbillion of letters of credit outstanding, $\n1.2\n billion of surety bonds and other guarantees issued by insurance companies, and $\n388\n million of tax equity financing related guarantees.\nEnvironmental \n— The Company periodically reviews its obligations as they relate to compliance with environmental laws, including site restoration and remediation. For the periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized liabilities of $\n2\n million and $\n9\n million, respectively, for projected environmental remediation costs. These amounts are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within \nAccrued and other liabilities\n and \nOther noncurrent liabilities. \nDue to the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future costs of compliance or remediation could be higher or lower than the amount currently accrued. Moreover, where no liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that the Company may be required to incur remediation costs or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2024. Unasserted claims are not included in the range of potential losses related to environmental matters until it is probable that a claim will be asserted and there is a reasonable possibility that the outcome will be unfavorable. In aggregate, the Company estimates the range of potential losses related to environmental matters, where estimable, to be immaterial. The amounts considered reasonably possible do not include amounts accrued as discussed above. \nLitigation \n—\n \nThe Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company accrues for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has recognized aggregate liabilities for all claims of approximately $\n5\n million and $\n17\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within \nAccrued and other liabilities\n and \nOther noncurrent liabilities\n. A significant portion of these accrued liabilities relate to regulatory matters and commercial disputes in international jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that these accrued liabilities will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise.\nWhere no accrued liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2024. The material contingencies where a loss is reasonably possible primarily include disputes with offtakers, suppliers and EPC contractors; alleged breaches of contract; alleged violation of laws and regulations; income tax and non-income tax matters with tax authorities; and regulatory matters. In aggregate, the Company estimates the range of potential losses, where estimable, related to these reasonably possible material contingencies to be between $\n39\n million and $\n66\n million. Included in this range is a reasonably possible legal contingency for environmental remediation costs related to AES Sul, a business the Company disposed of in 2016, estimated to be approximately R$\n15\n million to R$\n60\n million ($\n2\n million to $\n10\n million). The amounts considered reasonably possible do not include the amounts accrued, as discussed above.

The remaining two plans include union and non-union employees at AES Indiana and union employees at AES Ohio. The DC Plans are qualified under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. Most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the appropriate plan except for those employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, unless such agreement specifically provides that the employee is considered an eligible employee under a plan. Within the DC Plans, the Company provides matching contributions in addition to other non-matching contributions. Participants are fully vested in their own contributions. The Company's contributions vest over various time periods ranging from immediate up to \nfive years\n. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, costs for defined contribution plans were approximately $\n47\n million, $\n40\n million and $\n31\n million, respectively.\nDefined Benefit Plans\n — \nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees (\"the DB Plans\").

These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions.\nThe assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: discount rates, salary growth, retirement rates, inflation, expected return on plan assets, and mortality rates. The effects of actual results differing from the Company's assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect the Company's recognized expense in such future periods. Unrecognized gains or losses are amortized using the “corridor approach,” under which the net gain or loss in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of the assets, if applicable, is amortized. \nSensitivity of the Company's pension funded status to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions is shown below. Note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric and are specific to the base conditions at year-end 2024. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. The funded status as of December 31, 2024 is affected by the assumptions as of that date. Pension expense for 2024 is affected by the December 31, 2023 assumptions. \nThe impact on pension expense from a one percentage point change in these assumptions is shown in the following table (in millions):\nIncrease of 1% in the discount rate\n$\n(\n4\n)\nDecrease of 1% in the discount rate\n4\n \nIncrease of 1% in the long-term rate of return on plan assets\n(\n10\n)\nDecrease of 1% in the long-term rate of return on plan assets\n10\n \nThe following table summarizes the components of the net periodic benefit cost, both domestic and foreign, for the years indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Cost:\nU.S.\nForeign\nU.S.\nForeign\nU.S.\nForeign\nService cost\n$\n8\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n4\n \nInterest cost\n43\n \n17\n \n47\n \n21\n \n28\n \n17\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n46\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n52\n)\n(\n11\n)\n(\n53\n)\n(\n7\n)\nAmortization of prior service cost\n3\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \nAmortization of net loss\n7\n \n—\n \n7\n \n—\n \n8\n \n1\n \nTotal Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n$\n15\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n15\n \nThe following table summarizes the amounts reflected in AOCL, including AOCL attributable to noncontrolling interests, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024, that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2024\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nU.S.\nForeign\nPrior service cost\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n1\n \nUnrecognized net actuarial loss\n(\n22\n)\n(\n11\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n24\n)\n$\n(\n10\n)\nThe following table summarizes the Company's target allocation for 2024 and pension plan asset allocation, both domestic and foreign, as of the dates indicated:\nPercentage of Plan Assets as of December 31,\nTarget Allocations\n2024\n2023\nAsset Category\nU.S.\nForeign\nU.S.\nForeign\nU.S.\nForeign\nMutual Funds \nEquity securities\n21.80\n%\n—\n%\n22.00\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n21.80\n \n%\n5.30\n \n%\nDebt securities\n78.20\n%\n100.00\n%\n77.00\n \n%\n100.00\n \n%\n77.60\n \n%\n89.30\n \n%\nReal estate\n—\n%\n—\n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n0.80\n \n%\nOther\n—\n%\n—\n%\n1.00\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n0.60\n \n%\n4.60\n \n%\nTotal pension assets\n100.00\n \n%\n100.00\n \n%\n100.00\n \n%\n100.00\n \n%\nThe U.S. DB Plans seek to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\n•\nmaintenance of sufficient income and liquidity to pay retirement benefits and other lump sum payments;\n166 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n•\nlong-term rate of return in excess of the annualized inflation rate;\n•\nlong-term rate of return, net of relevant fees, that meets or exceeds the assumed actuarial rate; and\n•\nlong-term competitive rate of return on investments, net of expenses, that equals or exceeds various benchmark rates.\nThe asset allocation is reviewed periodically to determine a suitable asset allocation which seeks to manage risk through portfolio diversification and takes into account the above-stated objectives, in conjunction with current funding levels, cash flow conditions, and economic and industry trends.

The substance of such arrangements is that of a preferred structure, whereby tax equity investors are granted preferential returns in the form of significant earnings and tax allocations from the partnership, until a specified internal rate of return is achieved.\nIn some cases, these agreements contain certain partnership rights, though not currently in effect, that may enable the tax equity investor to exit in the future. As a result, the noncontrolling ownership interest is considered temporary equity. Some of these tax equity partnership agreements have redemption features dependent upon the passage of time, therefore the noncontrolling ownership interests are probable of becoming redeemable. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying values of these noncontrolling ownership interests exceeded the redemption values, therefore no adjustments to the carrying values were necessary. Certain other tax equity partnership agreements have redemption features contingent upon the underlying assets achieving agreed-upon project milestones. The Company has concluded it is probable that these projects will reach the specified milestones, therefore the noncontrolling ownership interests are not probable of becoming redeemable and subsequent adjustments to the carrying value were not required.\nIn 2024, 2023, and 2022, AES Clean Energy, through multiple transactions, sold noncontrolling interests in project companies to tax equity investors, resulting in increases to \nRedeemable stock of subsidiaries\n of $\n159\n million,$\n100\n million, and $\n157\n million, respectively. During 2024, certain renewables development projects with redemption features were placed in service, resulting in the expiration of the redemption features. As a result, noncontrolling ownership interests of $\n159\n million were reclassified from \nRedeemable stock of subsidiaries \nto \nNoncontrolling interests\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. AES Clean Energy is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nPike County BESS — \nIn December 2024, AES Indiana sold a noncontrolling interest in the Pike County energy storage project to a tax equity investor, resulting in a $\n38\n million increase to \nRedeemable stock of subsidiaries\n. The redemption feature of the tax equity partnership agreement is contingent upon the underlying assets being placed in service by a guaranteed date. The Company has concluded it is probable that the project will be placed in service by the guaranteed date, therefore the noncontrolling ownership interest is not probable of becoming redeemable and subsequent adjustments to the carrying value were not required. AES Indiana is reported in the Utilities SBU reportable segment.\n168 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nIPALCO\n — In December 2022 and during 2024, CDPQ made equity capital contributions of $\n77\n million and $\n68\n million, respectively, to IPALCO as part of capital calls primarily to raise proceeds for AES Indiana's TDSIC and replacement generation project and for funding needs related to AES Indiana’s capital expenditure program. The Company and CDPQ made capital contributions on a proportional share basis, therefore the contributions did not change the Company’s ownership interest in IPALCO. The Company has concluded that the likelihood of an event that would allow CDPQ to redeem its interest under the terms of the shareholder agreement is remote, but would require redemption at fair value. Therefore, the noncontrolling ownership interest is not probable of becoming redeemable and subsequent adjustments to the carrying value were not required. IPALCO is reported in the Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nAES Clean Energy Development \n— As part of the formation of AES Clean Energy Development in February 2021, the noncontrolling interest partner received certain partnership rights that would enable them to exit in the future. As a result, the noncontrolling ownership interest was considered temporary equity. In May 2024, these redemption features expired without being exercised and the noncontrolling ownership interest of $\n577\n million was reclassified from\n Redeemable stock of subsidiaries \nto \nNoncontrolling interests\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. AES Clean Energy Development is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nPotengi \n— In March 2022, Tucano Holding I (“Tucano”), a subsidiary of AES Brasil, issued new shares in the Potengi wind development project. BRF S.A. (“BRF”) acquired shares representing \n24\n% of the equity in the project for $\n12\n million, reducing the Company’s indirect ownership interest in Potengi to \n35.5\n%. As the Company maintained control after the transaction, Potengi continued to be consolidated by the Company. As part of the transaction, BRF was given an option to sell its entire ownership interest at the conclusion of the PPA term and therefore the noncontrolling ownership interest was considered temporary equity.\nIn October 2024, the Company completed the sale of its \n47.3\n% controlling interest in AES Brasil, which included the Potengi wind development project. See Note 25—\nHeld-for-Sale and Dispositions \nfor further information. Prior to its sale, Potengi was reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nAES Indiana Preferred Stock \n— In December 2022, AES Indiana redeemed all of its outstanding preferred shares for $\n60\n million. The preferred shares were retired upon redemption as there is no intention for the shares to be reissued. AES Indiana is reported in the Utilities SBU reportable segment.\n18. \nEQUITY\nEquity Units\nIn March 2021, the Company issued \n10,430,500\n Equity Units with a total notional value of $\n1,043\n million. Each Equity Unit had a stated amount of $\n100\n and was initially issued as a Corporate Unit, consisting of a forward stock purchase contract (“2024 Purchase Contracts”) and a \n10\n% undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of \n0\n% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, issued without par and with a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\n per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”). \nThe Company concluded that the Equity Units should be accounted for as one unit of account based on the economic linkage between the 2024 Purchase Contracts and the Series A Preferred Stock, as well as the Company's assessment of the applicable accounting guidance relating to combining freestanding instruments. The Equity Units represented mandatorily convertible preferred stock. Accordingly, the shares associated with the combined instrument were reflected in diluted earnings per share using the if-converted method.\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the Equity Units, the Company received approximately $\n1\n billion in proceeds, net of underwriting costs and commissions, before offering expenses. The proceeds for the issuance of \n1,043,050\n shares were attributed to the Series A Preferred Stock for $\n838\n million and $\n205\n million for the present value of the quarterly payments due to holders of the 2024 Purchase Contracts (\"Contract Adjustment Payments\"). The proceeds were used for the development of the AES renewables businesses, U.S. utility businesses, LNG infrastructure, and for other developments determined by management.\n169 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nThe Series A Preferred Stock did not bear any dividends and the liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock did not accrete. The Series A Preferred Stock had no maturity date and would remain outstanding unless converted by holders or redeemed by the Company. Holders of the preferred shares had limited voting rights. The Series A Preferred Stock was pledged as collateral to support holders’ purchase obligations under the 2024 Purchase Contracts, which obligated the holders to purchase, on February 15, 2024, for a price of $\n100\n in cash, a maximum number of \n57,467,883\n shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). The initial settlement rate determining the number of shares that each holder must purchase could not exceed the maximum settlement rate and was determined over a market value averaging period preceding February 15, 2024. The initial maximum settlement rate of \n3.864\n was calculated using an initial reference price of $\n25.88\n, equal to the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on March 4, 2021. On February 15, 2024, the Series A Preferred Stock was tendered to satisfy the 2024 Purchase Contract’s settlement price and the Corporate Units were converted into shares of the Company’s common stock at the maximum settlement rate of \n3.8859\n, equivalent to a reference price of $\n25.73\n. The Series A Preferred Stock was canceled and \n40,531,845\n shares of AES common stock were issued upon conversion.\nThe Company paid Contract Adjustment Payments to the holders of the 2024 Purchase Contracts at a rate of \n6.875\n% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15, commencing on May 15, 2021. The $\n205\n million present value of the Contract Adjustment Payments at inception reduced the Series A Preferred Stock. As each quarterly Contract Adjustment Payment was made, the related liability was reduced and the difference between the cash payment and the present value accreted to interest expense, approximately $\n5\n million over the three-year term. The final Contract Adjustment Payments were made on February 15, 2024.\nEquity Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests\nAES Clean Energy Tax Equity Partnerships \n— The majority of solar projects in the U.S. have been financed with tax equity structures, in which tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects. The substance of such arrangements is that of a preferred structure, whereby tax equity investors are granted preferential returns in the form of significant earnings and tax allocations from the partnership, until a specified internal rate of return is achieved.\nDuring 2024, 2023, and 2022, AES Clean Energy Development and AES Renewable Holdings, through multiple transactions, sold noncontrolling interests in project companies to tax equity investors, resulting in the following increases to NCI (in millions):\nBusiness\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAES Clean Energy Development\n$\n603\n \n$\n1,039\n \n$\n230\n \nAES Renewable Holdings\n263\n \n124\n \n88\n \nIn the third quarter of 2023, AES Renewable Holdings completed buyouts of tax equity partners at Buffalo Gap I, Buffalo Gap II and six other project companies, resulting in a decrease to NCI of $\n45\n million and an increase to additional paid-in capital of $\n34\n million. AES Clean Energy Development and AES Renewable Holdings are reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nAES Brasiliana — \nIn October 2024, prior to and separate from the sale of AES Brasil, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling ownership interest in AES Brasiliana Holdings Ltda. (\"AES Brasiliana\") for a nominal amount. This transaction resulted in a $\n304\n million decrease in Parent Company Stockholders' Equity due to a decrease in additional paid-in-capital of $802 million, offset by the reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments from NCI to AOCL of $\n498\n million. As the Company maintained control after the acquisition, AES Brasiliana continues to be consolidated by the Company within the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nChile Renovables \n—\n Under its renewables partnership agreement with \nGlobal Infrastructure Management, LLC (“GIP”)\n, AES Andes will contribute a specified pipeline of renewables development projects to Chile Renovables as the projects reach commercial operations, and GIP may make additional contributions to maintain its \n49\n% ownership interest. During 2024, 2023, and \n2022, \nAES Andes completed the sale of the following projects to Chile Renovables (in millions):\n170 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nBusiness\nTransaction Period\nSale Price\nIncrease to Noncontrolling Interests\nIncrease (Decrease) to Additional Paid-In Capital\nAndes Solar 2a\nJanuary 2022\n$\n37\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n9\n \nLos Olmos\nJune 2022\n80\n \n68\n \n12\n \nCampo Lindo\nSeptember 2023\n50\n \n59\n \n(\n9\n)\nBolero\nNovember 2023\n58\n \n57\n \n1\n \nAndes Solar 2b\nDecember 2023\n156\n \n145\n \n11\n \nMesamávida\nFebruary 2024\n40\n \n51\n \n(\n11\n)\nIn December 2023, Chile Renovables issued \n$\n275\n million\n of preferred shares to GIP, the proceeds of which will be used to fund the development of an additional pipeline of renewables projects. Under the terms of the operating agreement, GIP will receive an escalating specified internal rate of return up until the point the projects reach commercial operations. As each project reaches commercial operations, the preferred shares will convert to common stock and GIP may make additional contributions to maintain its \n49\n% ownership interest. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the San Matias, Andes Solar IV, and Andes Solar 2b Expansion projects reached commercial operations. The preferred shares were converted to common stock and GIP made additional contributions of \n$\n77\n million\n, resulting in an increase to NCI of \n$\n74\n million\n and an increase to additional paid-in capital of \n$\n3\n million\n. \nAs the Company maintained control after each of these transactions, Chile Renovables continues to be consolidated by the Company within the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nAES Puerto Rico Solar — \nIn May 2024, AES CFE Holding II entered into an agreement for the sale of a \n30\n% ownership interest in the Marahu project for $\n35\n million, resulting in an increase to NCI. As the Company maintained control after this transaction, AES Puerto Rico Solar continues to be consolidated by the Company within the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nHardy Hills Solar — \nIn December 2023, AES Indiana sold a noncontrolling interest in the Hardy Hills solar project to a tax equity investor, resulting in a $\n79\n million increase to NCI.

AES Indiana is reported in the Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nAES Dominicana \n— In December 2023, the Company completed the sale of a \n20\n% ownership interest in AES Dominicana for $\n192\n million. AES Dominicana consists of five operating subsidiaries: Andres, Los Mina, Bayasol, Santanasol, and Agua Clara. This transaction decreased the Company's economic interest to \n65\n% and resulted in a $\n74\n million increase in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to an increase in additional paid-in-capital of $\n73\n million and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from AOCL to NCI of $\n1\n million. As the Company maintained control after the sale, AES Dominicana continues to be consolidated by the Company. Andres and Los Mina are included within the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment and Bayasol, Santanasol, and Aqua Clara are included within the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nColon \n— In December 2023, the Company completed the sale of a \n35\n% ownership interest in Colon for $\n146\n million, which decreased the Company's economic interest to \n65\n%. This transaction resulted in a $\n43\n million increase in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to an increase in additional paid-in-capital of $\n31\n million and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from AOCL to NCI of $\n12\n million. As the Company maintained control after the sale, Colon continues to be consolidated by the Company within the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nAES Renewable Holdings \n— In December 2023, AES Renewable Holdings issued preferred shares in a portfolio of operating assets (\"OpCo 1\") to HASI for total proceeds of $\n143\n million.

This transaction resulted in a $\n91\n million increase in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to an increase in additional paid-in-capital of $\n94\n million, net of tax and transaction costs, partially offset by the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive income from AOCL to NCI of $\n3\n million. As the Company maintained control after the sale, Southland Energy continues to be consolidated by the Company. The CCGT units and interconnected battery-based energy storage facilities are included within the Energy Infrastructure SBU and Renewables SBU reportable segments, respectively.\nAES Brasil\n \n— \nIn September 2022, AES Brasil commenced a private placement offering for its existing shareholders to subscribe for up to \n116\n million newly issued shares, of which \n107\n million were subscribed. AES Holdings Brasil Ltda. (\"AHB\") and noncontrolling interest holders subscribed for \n54\n million and \n53\n million shares, respectively, thereby increasing AES’ indirect beneficial interest in AES Brasil to \n47.4\n% and resulting in additional capital contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $\n98\n million, an increase in additional paid-in capital of $\n10\n million, and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from NCI to AOCL of $\n3\n million. Prior to its sale in October 2024, AES Brasil was reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nGuaimbê Holding \n— In January 2022, the Ventus wind complex and AGV solar complex were incorporated by Guaimbê Solar Holding S.A.

Using the accounting guidance on segment reporting, the Company determined that its four operating segments are aligned with its four reportable segments corresponding to its SBUs.\n•\nRenewables\n \n— \nSolar, wind, energy storage, and hydro generation facilities;\n•\nUtilities\n \n— \nAES Indiana, AES Ohio, and AES El Salvador regulated utilities and their generation facilities;\n•\nEnergy Infrastructure\n \n— \nNatural gas, LNG, coal, pet coke, diesel, and oil generation facilities, and our businesses in Chile, which have a mix of generation sources, including renewables, that are pooled to service our existing PPAs; and\n•\nNew Energy Technologies\n \n— \nInvestments in\n \nFluence, Uplight, Maximo, and other new and innovative energy technology businesses.\nOur Renewables, Utilities, and Energy Infrastructure SBUs participate in our generation business line, in which we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. Our Utilities SBU participates in our utilities business line, in which we own and/or operate utilities to generate or purchase, distribute, transmit, and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial, and governmental sectors within a defined service area. In certain circumstances, our utilities also generate and sell electricity on the wholesale market. Our New Energy Technologies SBU includes investments in new and innovative technologies to support leading-edge greener energy solutions.\nIncluded in \"Corporate and Other\" are the results of the AES self-insurance company, corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our four reportable segments, and certain intercompany charges such as self-insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as its primary segment performance measure. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs, adjusted for the impact of NCI and interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs of our equity affiliates, and adding back interest income recognized under service concession arrangements; excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses pertaining to derivative transactions, equity securities, and financial assets and liabilities measured using the fair value option; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits, and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; and (e) gains, losses, and costs due to the early retirement of debt or troubled debt restructuring. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company updated the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to include accretion of AROs in the \ndepreciation and amortization\n add-back, as this is how the Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates the underlying business performance of the segments. For comparability and consistency, segment Adjusted EBITDA figures presented below have been recast to conform to the current presentation. The impact of \n174 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nthis update resulted in an increase to Adjusted EBITDA of $\n22\n million, $\n16\n million, and $\n18\n million in each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company has concluded Adjusted EBITDA better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Additionally, given its large number of businesses and overall complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted EBITDA is a more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company's results. The Chief Operating Decision Maker uses Adjusted EBITDA to allocate resources and capital for each segment in the annual budget and forecasting process, including making decisions on where to reinvest profits to support segment growth. On a monthly basis, the Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews variances in budget versus actual Adjusted EBITDA and monitors changes in forecasted Adjusted EBITDA to assess the underlying operating performance and analyze risks and opportunities at each segment.\nRevenue and Adjusted EBITDA are presented before inter-segment eliminations, which includes the effect of intercompany transactions with other segments except for charges for certain management fees and the write-off of intercompany balances, as applicable. All intra-segment activity has been eliminated within the segment. Inter-segment activity has been eliminated within the total consolidated results.\nThe following tables present financial information by segment for the periods indicated (in millions): \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nRenewables SBU\nUtilities SBU\nEnergy Infrastructure SBU\nNew Energy Technologies SBU\nTotal\nRevenue\n$\n2,510\n \n$\n3,608\n \n$\n6,238\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n12,357\n \nCorporate and other\n162\n \nEliminations\n(\n241\n)\nTotal Revenue\n$\n12,278\n \nLess:\nTotal cost of sales excluding depreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs \n(1)\n1,752\n \n2,607\n \n4,568\n \n8\n \nOther segment items\n \n(2)\n206\n \n209\n \n304\n \n31\n \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n552\n \n$\n792\n \n$\n1,366\n \n$\n(\n38\n)\n$\n2,672\n \nReconciliation to income from continuing operations before taxes\nCorporate and other\n11\n \nEliminations\n(\n44\n)\nInterest expense\n(\n1,485\n)\nInterest income\n381\n \nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs\n(\n1,264\n)\nAdjusted for:\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries\n734\n \nIncome tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income), and depreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs from equity affiliates\n(\n136\n)\nInterest income recognized under service concession arrangements\n(\n65\n)\nUnrealized derivative and equity securities gains\n94\n \nUnrealized foreign currency losses\n(\n16\n)\nDisposition/acquisition losses\n323\n \nImpairment losses\n(\n280\n)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n(\n57\n)\nIncome from continuing operations before taxes\n$\n868\n \n_____________________________\n(1)\nSegment-level total cost of sales excluding depreciation, amortization, and accretion of AROs is considered regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.

The RSUs are generally granted based upon a percentage of the participant's base salary. Most RSUs have a three-year vesting period and vest evenly in annual increments over that period. In all circumstances, RSUs granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the RSU in cash or other assets of AES.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, RSUs issued had a grant date fair value equal to the closing price of the Company's stock on the grant date. The Company does not discount the grant date fair values to reflect any post-vesting restrictions. RSUs granted to employees during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 had grant date weighted average fair values per RSU of $\n16.01\n, $\n22.33\n, and $\n20.92\n, respectively.\nThe 2022 and 2023 RSUs awarded to certain executives have a performance condition related to the achievement of environmental and social goals for the three-year periods ending December 31, 2024, and \n178 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nDecember 31, 2025, respectively. This performance condition can adjust the final number of units that vest to increase or decrease by up to 15% of the total units for all three years. The adjustment will be reflected in the number of units that vest at the end of the three-year performance period.\nThe following table summarizes the components of the Company's stock-based compensation related to its employee RSUs recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements (in millions):\nDecember 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRSU expense before income tax\n$\n22\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n16\n \nTax benefit\n(\n5\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n2\n)\nRSU expense, net of tax\n$\n17\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n14\n \nTotal value of RSUs converted\n \n(1)\n$\n9\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n8\n \nTotal fair value of RSUs vested\n$\n19\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n13\n \n_____________________________\n(1)\nAmount represents fair market value on the date of conversion.\nCash was not used to settle RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. $\n2\n million and $\n1\n million of compensation cost was capitalized as part of the cost of an asset during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, no compensation cost was capitalized as part of the cost of an asset. As of December 31, 2024, total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs of $\n28\n million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately \n1.7\n years. There were no modifications to RSU awards during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nA summary of the activity of RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2024 follows (RSUs in thousands):\nRSUs\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Values\nWeighted Average Remaining Vesting Term (in years)\nNonvested at December 31, 2023\n2,043\n \n$\n22.60\n \nVested\n(\n811\n)\n23.34\n \nForfeited and expired\n(\n174\n)\n19.77\n \nGranted\n1,553\n \n16.01\n \nNonvested at December 31, 2024\n2,611\n \n$\n18.64\n \n1.63\nExpected to vest at December 31, 2024\n2,449\n \n$\n18.70\n \nThe Company initially recognizes compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. In 2024, AES has estimated a weighted average forfeiture rate of \n7.89\n% for RSUs granted in 2024. This estimate will be revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of instruments forfeited is likely to differ from previous estimates. Based on the estimated forfeiture rate, the Company expects to expense $\n23\n million on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of \nthree years\n.\nThe following table summarizes the RSUs that vested and were converted during the periods indicated (RSUs in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRSUs vested during the year\n811\n \n632\n \n576\n \nRSUs converted during the year, net of shares withheld for taxes\n514\n \n407\n \n380\n \nShares withheld for taxes\n297\n \n225\n \n196\n \nOTHER SHARE BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company has three other share-based award programs. The Company has recorded expense of $\n12\n million, $\n2\n million, and $\n23\n million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, related to these programs. \nPerformance Stock Units\n \n— In 2022, 2023, and 2024, the Company issued PSUs to officers under its long-term compensation plan. PSUs are stock units which include performance conditions. For 2022, 2023, and 2024, performance conditions are based on the Company’s Parent Free Cash Flow target. The performance conditions determine the vesting and final share equivalent per PSU and can result in earning an award payout range of \n0\n% to \n200\n%, depending on the achievement. The Company believes it is probable that the performance condition will be met and will continue to be evaluated throughout the performance period. In all circumstances, PSUs granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the stock units in cash or other assets of AES.\nPerformance Cash Units\n — In 2022, 2023, and 2024, the Company issued PCUs to its officers under its long-term compensation plan. The value for the 2022 and 2023 units is dependent on the market condition of total stockholder return on AES common stock as compared to the total stockholder return of the Standard and Poor's \n179 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n500 Utilities Sector Index, Standard and Poor's 500 Index, and MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America Index over a three-year measurement period. The value for the 2024 units is dependent on the market condition of total stockholder return on AES common stock as compared to the total stockholder return of the Standard and Poor's 500 Utilities Sector Index, Standard and Poor's 500 Index, and a custom Clean Energy peer group over a three-year measurement period. Since PCUs are settled in cash, they qualify for liability accounting and periodic measurement is required.\n \nStock options \n— In the past, AES granted options to non-employee directors to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to 100% of the market price at the date the option was granted. AES has not granted options since 2021. All stock options are fully vested and have a contractual term of 10 years. In all circumstances, stock options granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or oblige AES, to settle the stock options in cash or other assets of AES.\n21. \nREVENUE\nThe following table presents our revenue from contracts with customers and other revenue for the periods indicated (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nRenewables SBU\nUtilities SBU\nEnergy Infrastructure SBU\nNew Energy Technologies SBU\nCorporate, Other and Eliminations\nTotal\nNon-Regulated Revenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n$\n2,294\n \n$\n82\n \n$\n5,543\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n(\n78\n)\n$\n7,842\n \nOther non-regulated revenue\n \n(1)\n216\n \n4\n \n695\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n914\n \nTotal non-regulated revenue\n2,510\n \n86\n \n6,238\n \n1\n \n(\n79\n)\n8,756\n \nRegulated Revenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n—\n \n3,496\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3,496\n \nOther regulated revenue\n—\n \n26\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n26\n \nTotal regulated revenue\n—\n \n3,522\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3,522\n \nTotal revenue\n$\n2,510\n \n$\n3,608\n \n$\n6,238\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n(\n79\n)\n$\n12,278\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nRenewables SBU\nUtilities SBU\nEnergy Infrastructure SBU\nNew Energy Technologies SBU\nCorporate, Other and Eliminations\nTotal\nNon-Regulated Revenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n$\n2,198\n \n$\n68\n \n$\n6,181\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n(\n77\n)\n$\n8,445\n \nOther non-regulated revenue\n \n(1)\n141\n \n4\n \n655\n \n1\n \n(\n1\n)\n800\n \nTotal non-regulated revenue\n2,339\n \n72\n \n6,836\n \n76\n \n(\n78\n)\n9,245\n \nRegulated Revenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n—\n \n3,391\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3,391\n \nOther regulated revenue\n—\n \n32\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n32\n \nTotal regulated revenue\n—\n \n3,423\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3,423\n \nTotal revenue\n$\n2,339\n \n$\n3,495\n \n$\n6,836\n \n$\n76\n \n$\n(\n78\n)\n$\n12,668\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nRenewables SBU\nUtilities SBU\nEnergy Infrastructure SBU\nNew Energy Technologies SBU\nCorporate, Other and Eliminations\nTotal\nNon-Regulated Revenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n$\n1,791\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n6,871\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n(\n100\n)\n$\n8,638\n \nOther non-regulated revenue\n \n(1)\n102\n \n4\n \n333\n \n2\n \n—\n \n441\n \nTotal non-regulated revenue\n1,893\n \n79\n \n7,204\n \n3\n \n(\n100\n)\n9,079\n \nRegulated Revenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n—\n \n3,507\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3,507\n \nOther regulated revenue\n—\n \n31\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n31\n \nTotal regulated revenue\n—\n \n3,538\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3,538\n \nTotal revenue\n$\n1,893\n \n$\n3,617\n \n$\n7,204\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n100\n)\n$\n12,617\n \n_____________________________\n(1)\nOther non-regulated revenue primarily includes lease and derivative activity not accounted for under ASC 606.\n180 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nContract Balances — \nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in accounts receivable and contract liabilities. The contract liabilities from contracts with customers were $\n237\n million and $\n328\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized revenue of $\n79\n million and $\n70\n million, respectively, that was included in the corresponding contract liability balance at the beginning of the periods.\nIn June 2023, the Company closed on an agreement to terminate the PPA for the Warrior Run coal-fired power plant for total consideration of $\n357\n million, to be paid by the offtaker through the end of the previous contract term in January 2030. Under the termination agreement, the plant provided capacity through May 2024. The termination represented a contract modification under which the discounted termination payments, as well as a pre-existing contract liability, were recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the remaining performance obligation period for approximately $\n32\n million per month. On February 1, 2024, the Company executed a receivable sale agreement to transfer all of its rights, title, and interest in the remaining future cash flows under this agreement. At the time of execution, the transaction was considered a sale of future revenue under U.S. GAAP, and as such, the net proceeds of $\n273\n million were recorded as debt. Upon completion of the remaining performance obligation in May 2024, the corresponding receivable balance of $\n267\n million, net of valuation allowance of $\n7\n million, and the remaining debt balance of $\n260\n million were derecognized upon accounting for the transaction as a sale of receivables.\nA significant financing arrangement exists for our Mong Duong plant in Vietnam. The plant was constructed under a BOT contract and will be transferred to the Vietnamese government after the completion of a 25 year PPA. The performance obligation to construct the facility was substantially completed in 2015. Contract consideration related to the construction, but not yet collected through the 25 year PPA, was reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Mong Duong met the held-for-sale criteria and the loan receivable balance of $\n963\n million and $\n1.1\n billion, net of CECL reserve of $\n23\n million and $\n26\n million, respectively, was classified as held-for-sale assets. Of the loan receivable balance, $\n121\n million and $\n108\n million, respectively, was classified in \nCurrent held-for-sale assets\n, and $\n842\n million and $\n962\n million, respectively, was classified in\n Noncurrent held-for-sale assets \non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 25\n—\nHeld-for-Sale and Dispositions\n \nfor further information.\nRemaining Performance Obligations — \nThe transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents future consideration for unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $\n7\n million, primarily consisting of fixed consideration for the sale of renewable energy credits (\"RECs\") in long-term contracts in the U.S. We expect to recognize revenue of approximately $\n1\n million per year between 2025 and 2029, and the remainder thereafter.\n \n22. \nOTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE\nOther income generally includes gains on insurance recoveries in excess of property damage, gains on asset sales and liability extinguishments, favorable judgments on contingencies, allowance for funds used during construction, and other income from miscellaneous transactions.

As of December 31, 2024, Ventanas was classified as held-for-sale. The carrying amount of the Ventanas disposal group exceeded the agreed-upon sales price and as a result, the Company recognized pre-tax impairment expense of $\n125\n million. The sale of Ventanas closed in January 2025. See Note 25\n—\nHeld-for-Sale and Dispositions\n for further information. Prior to its sale, Ventanas was reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nAES Clean Energy Development Projects \n— AES Clean Energy Development has a pipeline of U.S. renewables projects that are in various stages of development and construction. In some cases, if development efforts are not successful, the Company may abandon a particular project, writing off all the intangible assets and capitalized development costs incurred. The fair value of each abandoned project with no salvage value is determined to be zero as there are no future projected cash flows.\nIn 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense related to the write-off of projects that were determined to be no longer viable totaling $\n95\n million, $\n151\n million, and $\n18\n million, respectively. The impairment expense recognized in 2023 primarily related to the write-off of project development intangibles which were recognized at fair value when the Company acquired sPower's development platform as part of the formation of AES Clean Energy Development. See Note 26\n—\nAcquisitions\n for further information. AES Clean Energy Development is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nAES Brasil\n — In May 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its \n47.3\n% controlling interest in AES Brasil, a 5.2 GW portfolio of renewable energy facilities. Upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria in May 2024, the Company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the carrying value of the disposal group of $\n1,577\n million was greater than its fair value less costs to sell of $\n1,552\n million. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax impairment expense of $25 million. The Company performed a subsequent impairment analysis as of September 30, 2024 and recognized additional pre-tax impairment expense of $\n55\n million, primarily due to depreciation of the Brazilian real and increased costs to sell. The sale of AES Brasil closed in October 2024. See Note 25—\nHeld-for-Sale and Dispositions\n for further information. Prior to its sale, AES Brasil was reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nMong Duong \n— In November 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its entire \n51\n% ownership interest in Mong Duong 2, a coal-fired plant in Vietnam, and \n51\n% equity interest in Mong Duong Finance Holdings B.V., an SPV accounted for as an equity affiliate (collectively \"Mong Duong\"), and as of December 31, 2024, Mong Duong continued to be classified as held-for-sale. The carrying amount of the Mong Duong disposal group exceeded the expected sales proceeds and as a result, the Company recognized total pre-tax impairment expense of $\n62\n million and $\n167\n million during 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 25\n—\nHeld-for-Sale and Dispositions\n for further information. Mong Duong is reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nWarrior Run \n— On September 30, 2023, the Company filed a Generator Deactivation Notice with PJM stating its intention to either retire or mothball the Warrior Run coal-fired facility on June 1, 2024. On November 30, 2023, PJM approved the potential deactivation, therefore management reassessed the economic useful life of the generation facility. Due to the approval from PJM and the absence of other economically viable options, an \n183 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nimpairment indicator was identified. The Company performed an impairment analysis as of November 30, 2023, and determined that the fair value of the asset group was $\n25\n million, using the income approach. As a result, and since pre-tax losses were limited to the carrying value of the long-lived assets, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\n198\n million. The Company retired the generation facility in June 2024. Prior to its retirement, Warrior Run was reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nNew York Wind \n— In November 2023, AES Clean Energy Development, LLC (\"ACED\") was awarded ten projects from NYSERDA, six of which were related to the repowering of existing wind assets in New York that were acquired in November 2021. On November 28, 2023, the Company approved plans to execute the repowering project and sign a PPA with NYSERDA for the energy and capacity related to the repowered assets. As the repowering will result in decommissioning the existing turbines and reducing their depreciable lives, the approval to move forward with the repowering project was identified as an impairment indicator. The Company performed an impairment analysis as of November 30, 2023, and determined that the fair value of the asset group was $\n124\n million, using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\n186\n million. New York Wind is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nTEG and TEP \n— On October 1, 2022, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test for the TEG TEP reporting unit. The quantitative impairment test resulted in an estimated fair value of the reporting unit which was less than its carrying amount. The failure of the goodwill impairment test was identified as an impairment indicator for the long-lived assets of the TEG and TEP asset groups. The Company performed an impairment analysis as of October 1, 2022, and determined that the carrying amounts of the asset groups were not recoverable. The TEG and TEP asset groups were determined to have fair values of $\n164\n million and $\n147\n million, respectively, using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\n104\n million and $\n89\n million, respectively. Subsequent to the asset impairment being recorded, the Company re-performed the goodwill test and no impairment was noted.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, management identified an impairment indicator at the TEG and TEP asset groups due to a reduction in expected capacity cash flows after expiration of the current PPA. The Company performed an impairment analysis as of July 31, 2023, and determined that the carrying amounts of the asset groups were not recoverable. The TEG and TEP asset groups were determined to have fair values of $\n93\n million and $\n94\n million, respectively, using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\n77\n million and $\n59\n million, respectively. TEG and TEP are reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nNorgener\n — In May 2023, AES Andes announced its intention to accelerate the retirement of the Norgener coal-fired plant in Chile in order to further advance its decarbonization strategy. Due to this strategic development and the resulting decrease in useful life of the generation facility, the Company performed an impairment analysis as of May 1, 2023, and determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. The Norgener asset group was determined to have a fair value of $\n24\n million, using the income approach. As a result, and since pre-tax losses were limited to the carrying amount of the long-lived assets, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\n137\n million. The Company retired the generation facility in April 2024. Prior to its retirement, Norgener was reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nJordan \n— In November 2020, the Company signed an agreement to sell approximately \n26\n% ownership interest in Amman East and IPP4 for $\n58\n million. The generation plants were classified as held-for-sale until the sale was completed in March 2024. Due to the delay in closing the transaction, the carrying amount of the disposal group in subsequent periods exceeded the agreed-upon sales price, and total pre-tax impairment expense of $\n59\n million and $\n76\n million was recorded during 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 25\n—\nHeld-for-Sale and Dispositions\n \nfor further information. Amman East and IPP4 are reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nGAF Projects\n — During the second quarter of 2023, management concluded that the carrying value of six project companies at AES Renewable Holdings (the “GAF Projects”) may not be recoverable as the expected purchase price on the buyout of tax equity investors implied a loss on the transaction. The buyout was completed in July 2023. Management performed a recoverability test as of May 31, 2023 and concluded that the undiscounted cash flows of the GAF Projects did not exceed the carrying values of the asset groups for five of the six projects. The asset groups for the GAF Projects were determined to have a fair value of $\n11\n million, using the income \n184 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\napproach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\n18\n million. AES Renewable Holdings is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nMaritza \n— In May 2022, the Council for the European Union approved Bulgaria’s National Recovery and Resilience plan which commits the country to cease generating electricity from coal beyond 2038. As this plan is expected to prohibit the Company from operating the Maritza coal-fired plant through its estimated useful life, it was determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred. The Company reassessed the useful life of the facility and performed an impairment analysis as of April 30, 2022, in which it was determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. The Maritza asset group was determined to have a fair value of $\n452\n million, using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\n468\n million. Maritza is reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\n24. \nINCOME TAXES\nIncome Tax Provision \n— \nThe following table summarizes the expense for income taxes on continuing operations for the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nFederal:\nCurrent\n$\n4\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n3\n \nDeferred\n(\n220\n)\n15\n \n(\n18\n)\nState:\nCurrent\n29\n \n16\n \n2\n \nDeferred\n23\n \n30\n \n1\n \nForeign:\nCurrent\n249\n \n289\n \n256\n \nDeferred\n(\n26\n)\n(\n98\n)\n21\n \nTotal\n$\n59\n \n$\n261\n \n$\n265\n \nEffective and Statutory Rate Reconciliation \n— \nThe following table summarizes a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate as a percentage of income from continuing operations before taxes for the periods indicated:\nDecember 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nStatutory Federal tax rate\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\nState taxes, net of Federal tax benefit\n(\n2\n)\n%\n87\n \n%\n(\n1\n)\n%\nTaxes on foreign earnings\n(\n10\n)\n%\n14\n \n%\n(\n42\n)\n%\nValuation allowance\n52\n \n%\n83\n \n%\n(\n10\n)\n%\nUncertain tax positions\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n7\n \n%\nU.S. Investment Tax Credit\n(\n31\n)\n%\n(\n70\n)\n%\n—\n \n%\nNoncontrolling interest in U.S. subsidiaries\n25\n \n%\n115\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nNondeductible goodwill impairments\n—\n \n%\n3\n \n%\n(\n127\n)\n%\nU.S. capital loss\n(\n41\n)\n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nU.S. interest expense\n(\n5\n)\n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nOther—net\n(\n2\n)\n%\n(\n2\n)\n%\n(\n5\n)\n%\nEffective tax rate\n7\n \n%\n251\n \n%\n(\n157\n)\n%\nFor 2024, the (\n31\n)% U.S. Investment Tax Credit relates to investment tax credits for renewables projects placed in service this year.

The noncurrent income taxes receivable and payable are included in \nOther noncurrent assets\n and \nOther noncurrent liabilities\n, respectively, on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nThe following table summarizes the income taxes receivable and payable as of the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nIncome taxes receivable—current\n$\n85\n \n$\n95\n \nIncome taxes receivable—noncurrent\n32\n \n41\n \nTotal income taxes receivable\n$\n117\n \n$\n136\n \nIncome taxes payable—current\n$\n71\n \n$\n103\n \nIncome taxes payable—noncurrent\n—\n \n—\n \nTotal income taxes payable\n$\n71\n \n$\n103\n \nDeferred Income Taxes \n— Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and (b) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. These items are stated at the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards for tax return purposes of approximately $\n589\n million, which carry forward indefinitely. The Company also had capital loss carryforwards of approximately $\n1.7\n billion, which expire in 2029. Further, the Company had federal general business tax credit carryforwards of approximately $\n54\n million, which expire in 2040 and beyond. The Company had state net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2024 of approximately $\n4.7\n billion expiring primarily in years 2025 to 2044. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n2.4\n billion that expire at various times beginning in 2025 and some of which carry forward without expiration.\nValuation allowances increased $\n241\n million during 2024 to $\n913\n million at December 31, 2024. This net increase was primarily due to valuation allowance resulting from current period U.S. capital losses associated with the restructuring of a foreign holding company, partially offset by valuation allowance change related to the sale of AES Brasil.\nValuation allowances increased $\n95\n million during 2023 to $\n672\n million at December 31, 2023. This net increase was primarily due to valuation allowance established at acquisition of a Chilean subsidiary, as well as changes in realizability of deferred tax assets at certain Argentine subsidiaries.\nThe Company believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets as shown below will be realized when future taxable income is generated through the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and income that is expected to be generated by businesses that have long-term contracts or a history of generating taxable income. \nThe following table summarizes deferred tax assets and liabilities, as of the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, \n2024\n2023\nDifferences between book and tax basis of property\n$\n(\n1,104\n)\n$\n(\n966\n)\nInvestment in U.S. tax partnerships\n(\n785\n)\n(\n578\n)\nOther taxable temporary differences\n(\n438\n)\n(\n403\n)\nTotal deferred tax liability\n(\n2,327\n)\n(\n1,947\n)\nOperating loss carryforwards\n933\n \n1,132\n \nCapital loss carryforwards\n501\n \n65\n \nBad debt and other book provisions\n91\n \n92\n \nTax credit carryforwards\n48\n \n72\n \nOther deductible temporary differences\n542\n \n409\n \nTotal gross deferred tax asset\n2,115\n \n1,770\n \nLess: Valuation allowance\n(\n913\n)\n(\n672\n)\nTotal net deferred tax asset\n1,202\n \n1,098\n \nNet deferred tax liability\n$\n(\n1,125\n)\n$\n(\n849\n)\nThe Company considers undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. No taxes have been recorded with respect to our indefinitely reinvested earnings in accordance \n186 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nwith the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. Should the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may be subject to additional foreign withholding and state income taxes. Under the TCJA, future distributions from foreign subsidiaries will generally be subject to a federal dividends received deduction in the U.S. As of December 31, 2024, the cumulative amount of U.S. GAAP foreign un-remitted earnings upon which additional income taxes have not been provided is approximately $\n1\n billion. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of any additional taxes which may be payable on the undistributed earnings.\nIncome from operations in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. The Company's income tax benefits related to the tax status of these operations are estimated to be $\n28\n million, $\n19\n million and $\n27\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The per share effect of these benefits after noncontrolling interests was $\n0.03\n, $\n0.02\n and $\n0.02\n for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Included in the Company's income tax benefits is the benefit related to our operations in Vietnam, which is estimated to be $\n14\n million, $\n16\n million and $\n18\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The per share effect of these benefits related to our operations in Vietnam after noncontrolling interest was $\n0.01\n for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nThe following table shows the income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes, net equity in earnings of affiliates and noncontrolling interests, for the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nU.S.\n$\n(\n264\n)\n$\n(\n238\n)\n$\n22\n \nNon-U.S.\n1,158\n \n342\n \n(\n191\n)\nTotal\n$\n894\n \n$\n104\n \n$\n(\n169\n)\nUncertain Tax Positions \n— Uncertain tax positions have been classified as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless they are expected to be paid within one year. \nThe Company's policy for interest and penalties related to income tax exposures is to recognize interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \nThe following table shows the total amount of gross accrued income taxes related to interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nInterest related \n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \nPenalties related\n—\n \n—\n \nThe following table shows the expense/(benefit) related to interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits for the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal benefit for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nTotal expense for penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nWe are potentially subject to income tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally until the applicable statute of limitations expires.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would benefit the effective tax rate as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is $\n108\n million, $\n107\n million and $\n107\n million, respectively, of which $\n1\n million, $\n1\n million, and $\n2\n million, respectively, would be in the form of tax attributes that would warrant a full valuation allowance. Further, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit that would benefit the \n187 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\neffective tax rate as of 2024 would be reduced by approximately $\n34\n million of tax expense related to remeasurement from \n35\n% to \n21\n%. \nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits anticipated to result in a net increase to unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of December 31, 2024 is estimated to be between zero and $\n10\n million, primarily as a result of ongoing audits, including potential tax exam resolutions.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the periods indicated (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at January 1\n$\n107\n \n$\n107\n \n$\n122\n \nAdditions for current year tax positions\n—\n \n1\n \n4\n \nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n16\n)\nSettlements\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n3\n)\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nBalance at December 31\n$\n108\n \n$\n107\n \n$\n107\n \nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits. However, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty. It is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of December 31, 2024. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted.\n25. \nHELD-FOR-SALE AND DISPOSITIONS\nHeld-for-Sale\nVentanas — \nIn December 2024, the Company signed an agreement for the sale of its \n100\n% ownership interest in Empresa Electrica Ventanas SpA and Nucleo SpA (collectively \"Ventanas\"), owner of a coal-fired energy generation facility in Chile, for $\n5\n million. The sale closed in January 2025. Ventanas was classified as held-for-sale but did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. On a consolidated basis, the carrying value of net assets after impairment of the plant held-for-sale as of December 31, 2024 was $\n6\n million, and a pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\n125\n million was recorded. See Note 23\n—\nAsset Impairment Expense\n for further information. As of December 31, 2024, the significant assets and liabilities of Ventanas are inventory, deferred income tax, and accrued asset retirement obligation for $\n58\n million, $\n56\n million, and $\n43\n million, respectively. Ventanas is reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nDominican Republic Renewables —\n In December 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell \n50\n% of its interests in AES DR Renewable Holding and its subsidiaries (collectively \"Dominican Republic Renewables\"), whose main objective is the operation and administration of energy generation assets from primary energy resources. After completion of the sale, the Company will retain a \n50\n% ownership in Dominican Republic Renewables, which will be accounted for as an equity method investment. The sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025. As a result, Dominican Republic Renewables was classified as held-for-sale but did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Since the fair value less cost to sell exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment to be recorded. The carrying value of net assets held-for-sale as of December 31, 2024 was $\n95\n million on a consolidated basis. As of December 31, 2024, the significant assets and liabilities of Dominican Republic Renewables are property, plant and equipment and debt of $\n414\n million and $\n350\n million, respectively. Dominican Republic Renewables is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\n188 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nMong Duong — \nIn November 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its entire \n51\n% ownership interest in Mong Duong 2, a coal-fired plant in Vietnam, and \n51\n% equity interest in Mong Duong Finance Holdings B.V, an SPV accounted for as an equity affiliate (collectively \"Mong Duong\"). The sale is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close by early 2026. As a result, Mong Duong was classified as held-for-sale, but did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. On a consolidated basis, the carrying value of net assets after impairment of the plant held-for-sale as of December 31, 2024 was $\n357\n million. Management has recorded pre-tax asset impairment expense of $\n62\n million at Mong Duong. See Note 23\n—\nAsset Impairment Expense\n for further information. As of December 31, 2024, the significant assets and liabilities of Mong Duong are a long term financing receivable of $\n963\n million and debt of $\n526\n million, respectively. Mong Duong is reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nExcluding any impairment charges, pre-tax income (loss) and pre-tax income (loss) attributable to AES of businesses held-for-sale as of December 31, 2024 was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPre-tax income of businesses held-for-sale:\nMong Duong\n$\n79\n \n$\n92\n \n$\n109\n \nVentanas\n3\n \n13\n \n(\n5\n)\nDominican Republic Renewables\n(\n6\n)\n(\n4\n)\n4\n \nTotal pre-tax income of businesses held-for-sale\n$\n76\n \n$\n101\n \n$\n108\n \nPre-tax income attributable to AES of businesses held-for-sale:\nMong Duong\n$\n34\n \n$\n40\n \n$\n50\n \nVentanas\n3\n \n13\n \n(\n5\n)\nDominican Republic Renewables\n(\n4\n)\n(\n3\n)\n3\n \nTotal pre-tax income attributable to AES of businesses held-for-sale\n$\n33\n \n$\n50\n \n$\n48\n \nDispositions\nAES Brasil\n — In October 2024, the Company completed the sale of its \n47.3\n% controlling interest in AES Brasil Energia S.A. (\"AES Brasil\"), a 5.2 GW portfolio of renewable energy that is 51% hydroelectric, 43% wind, and 6% solar, for $\n586\n million, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $\n312\n million reported in \nGain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests\n on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The sale did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Prior to its sale, AES Brasil was reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nJordan —\n In March 2024, the Company completed the sale of approximately \n26\n% ownership interest in the Amman East and IPP4 generation plants for a sale price of $\n58\n million. After adjusting for dividends received since the execution of the sale and purchase agreement, the Company received a net cash payment of $\n45\n million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax loss on sale of $\n10\n million, reported in \nGain (loss) on disposal and sale of business interests\n on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. After completion of the sale, the Company retained \n10\n% ownership interest in each of the businesses, whose fair value was measured using the market approach technique, resulting in deconsolidation and recognition as equity method investments. Amman East and IPP4 are reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nThe following table summarizes, excluding any impairment charge or gain/loss on sale, the pre-tax income attributable to AES of disposed businesses for the periods indicated (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAES Brasil\n$\n7\n \n$\n49\n \n$\n22\n \nJordan\n5\n \n21\n \n(\n6\n)\nTotal\n$\n12\n \n$\n70\n \n$\n16\n \n189 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n26. \nACQUISITIONS\nAtacama Solar \n— On December 27, 2024, the Company closed an agreement for the purchase of \n100\n% of Atacama Solar SpA, which owns and operates photovoltaic plants with a capacity of 150 MW and is developing a 250 MW BESS as well as a 100 MW solar project. This acquisition will enhance the operational capacity, and the total consideration was $\n105\n million. The main assets acquired were PP&E valued at $\n102\n million and right-of-use assets for $\n28\n million. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition that did not meet the definition of a business. As Atacama Solar is not a VIE, any difference between the fair value of the assets and the consideration transferred was allocated to PP&E and intangible assets on a relative fair value basis. Atacama Solar is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nFelix — \nFelix DevCo, LLC (\"Felix\") was a joint venture with Air Products formed in 2022 to develop a green hydrogen production facility in Texas, and was previously accounted for as an equity method investment. On November 5, 2024, the Company acquired the remaining \n50\n% ownership interest in Felix from Air Products as part of a step-acquisition for $\n34\n million, including contingent consideration of $\n14\n million. The main assets acquired were development intangibles valued at $\n74\n million. As a result of the transaction, Felix was consolidated by the Company and no longer accounts for its investment under the equity method. The Company recognized a gain on the acquisition of $\n14\n million reported in \nOther income\n on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Felix is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nAES Clean Energy Solar Project Acquisitions — \nIn 2024, the Company closed on the acquisitions of 1.1 GW of renewables development projects in Texas, Virginia, Illinois, and California (the purchase of \n100\n% of the equity interests in Armadillo, Red Brick, Pulaski, Staley, Stags, and Jasmine solar projects). The total consideration of these acquisitions was $\n97\n million, including contingent consideration of $\n44\n million. The contingent consideration will be updated quarterly with any prospective changes in fair value recorded through earnings. The fair value of the consideration paid was attributed to identifiable assets and liabilities, consisting of intangible assets for $\n92\n million, primarily project development intangibles, right-of-use assets for $\n40\n million, PP&E for $\n18\n million, and lease liabilities for $\n40\n million. The transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions of variable interest entities that did not meet the definition of a business. AES Clean Energy is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nLong Point and Hot Air \n— On September 20, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase Long Point, an early development-stage project consisting of a 300 MW wind facility, a 150 MW solar facility, and a 40 MW battery storage facility, and Hot Air, an early development-stage 350 MW wind facility, both located in Arizona. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The total consideration paid of $\n6\n million, including transaction costs, was allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities on a relative fair value basis, primarily consisting of intangible assets. The remaining contingent consideration of up to $\n47\n million, which is not recorded at this time, will be recognized as part of the projects’ assets when the contingencies are resolved, and the consideration is paid or becomes payable. Long Point and Hot Air are reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nMadison and Birdseye\n — On April 5, 2024, the Company closed on the acquisition of the Madison solar project, a 63 MW construction-stage solar project in Virginia under contract with a 15-year virtual power purchase agreement (\"VPPA\"), and a pipeline of early-stage renewable energy development projects (\"Birdseye\"), to enhance its renewable energy portfolio. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination with a purchase price of $\n20\n million paid in cash; therefore, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, primarily consisting of CWIP valued at $\n78\n million and an off-market VPPA liability of $\n53\n million, were recorded at their fair values. The Company recorded preliminary amounts for the purchase price allocation at the time of the acquisition. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation and made measurement-period adjustments to the fair value of the assets acquired, primarily due to the determination that the Madison solar project would qualify for an increased ITC based on studies performed subsequent to the acquisition date.\nThe acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of $\n20\n million, recognized in \nOther income\n on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This gain represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired over the purchase price. The primary reason for the bargain purchase gain was the determination that the Madison solar project would qualify for an increased ITC, which had not been assigned value in the purchase price. Additionally, the safe harbor period was expiring at the end of 2024 for certain equipment associated with the Madison solar project, jeopardizing the tax credits associated with the asset. In order to capture the highest value from the project, the seller needed to complete a sale to a buyer that could complete construction \n190 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nin 2024. This is consistent with the seller's announcement in February 2023 that they would no longer invest in non-regulated solar generation projects and intended to divest their portfolio. Before recognizing the bargain purchase gain, the Company reassessed whether all assets and liabilities were correctly identified and valued. This included a reassessment of the reasonableness of all significant assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the market PPA price, forecasted operating expenses, and the discount rates utilized. We conducted an analysis and made detailed inquiries to confirm there were no material unrecorded liabilities or contingencies that would decrease the valuation. We monitored the projects subsequent to the acquisition and did not identify any indicators that the fair value of the net assets acquired should be reduced or that the assets were impaired. Madison and Birdseye are reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nRexford\n — On October 2, 2023, the Company, through its subsidiary Rexford 1 Holdings, LLC., entered into an agreement for the purchase of \n100\n% of the membership interests in 20SD 8me LLC., a 300 MW solar and 240 MW BESS project. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition of variable interest entities that did not meet the definition of a business. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values, which equaled the fair value of the consideration paid of approximately $\n253\n million, including contingent consideration of $\n4\n million. The nature of the assets acquired is largely tangible as they relate to construction in progress, along with typical working capital items and certain equipment.\nWe estimated the fair value of the construction in progress at approximately $\n282\n million, using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology. The cash flow assumptions align with executed contracts, and incorporate forward energy pricing curves after the expiration date of such contracts. The cash flow and discount rates assumptions are considered Level 3 inputs. The contingent consideration will be updated quarterly with any prospective changes in fair value recorded through earnings. Rexford is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nHoosier Wind —\n In August 2023, the Company, through its subsidiary AES Indiana, filed for IURC issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity approving the acquisition of \n100\n% of the interests in Hoosier Wind Project, LLC., which is an existing 106 MW wind facility located in Benton County, Indiana. IURC approval was received on January 24, 2024, and the transaction closed on February 29, 2024. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Of the total consideration transferred of $\n93\n million, including transaction costs, approximately $\n49\n million was allocated to the identifiable assets acquired on a relative fair value basis, primarily consisting of tangible wind farm assets and typical working capital items. The remaining consideration was allocated to the termination of the pre-existing PPA between AES Indiana and the Hoosier Wind Project, estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology, which was deferred as a long-term regulatory asset resulting from AES Indiana regulatory approval to recover associated costs. Hoosier Wind is reported in the Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nPetersburg Solar Project\n — On August 31, 2023, the Company entered into agreements for project development and for the purchase of \n100\n% of the membership in Petersburg Energy Center, LLC, a 250 MW solar and BESS project. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition of variable interest entities that did not meet the definition of a business. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values, which equaled the fair value of the consideration paid of approximately $\n49\n million. Petersburg Solar Project is reported in the Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nCalhoun\n — On July 18, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement for the purchase of \n100\n% of the membership interests in Calhoun County Solar Project, LLC., which holds a late development-stage 125 MW solar project. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition of variable interest entities that did not meet the definition of a business. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values, which equaled the fair value of the consideration paid of approximately $\n64\n million, including contingent consideration of $\n42\n million. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration for Calhoun was determined using probability-weighted discounted cash flows based on internal forecasts, which are considered Level 3 inputs. The probability of achieving the milestone payment used to calculate the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration was \n99\n%. Payments under the contingent consideration arrangement are largely binary and thus, a single probability of achieving the milestone was applied in the calculation of fair value. The contingent consideration will be updated quarterly with any prospective changes in fair value recorded through earnings. Calhoun is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment. \n191 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nBellefield\n — On June 5, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement for the purchase of \n100\n% of the membership interests in the Bellefield projects, consisting of two late development-stage solar and BESS projects of 1 GW each. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition of variable interest entities that did not meet the definition of a business. The Company agreed to make total cash payments including reimbursement of development and equipment costs of up to approximately $\n449\n million, a portion of which is contingent upon future milestones and price adjustments. This contingent consideration will be updated quarterly with any prospective changes in fair value recorded through earnings. \nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values, which equaled the fair value of the consideration to be paid of approximately $\n358\n million, including cash paid of $\n165\n million, contingent consideration of $\n165\n million, and deferred payments of $\n28\n million. The significant assets acquired include project development intangibles, land option intangibles, deposits made towards integral equipment purchases, and typical working capital items.\nWe estimated the fair value of the project development intangibles at approximately $\n200\n million, using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology. The cash flow assumptions align with executed contracts, and incorporate forward energy pricing curves after the expiration date of such contracts. The cash flow assumptions and discount rates are considered Level 3 inputs.\nWe estimated the fair value of the land option intangibles at approximately $\n82\n million, by comparing the intrinsic value (estimated using a sales comparison approach for purchase options and an income capitalization method for lease options) and the strike price of each option.\nThe estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of Bellefield was determined using probability-weighted discounted cash flows based on internal forecasts, which are considered Level 3 inputs. The weighted average probability of achieving the development milestones used to calculate the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration was \n91.9\n%. Payments under the contingent consideration arrangements are largely binary and thus, a single probability of achieving the milestone was applied in the calculation of fair value. The contingent consideration will be updated quarterly with any prospective changes in fair value recorded through earnings. Bellefield is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nBolero Solar Park — \nOn June 9, 2023, the Company, through its subsidiary AES Andes S.A., acquired \n100\n% of the equity interests in Helio Atacama Tres SpA, owner of the Bolero photovoltaic power plant for consideration of $\n114\n million. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition that did not meet the definition of a business. As Helio Atacama Tres is not a VIE, any difference between the fair value of the assets and consideration transferred will be allocated to PP&E on a relative fair value basis. Helio Atacama Tres is reported in the Energy Infrastructure SBU reportable segment.\nCubico II \n— On November 30, 2022, the Company, through its subsidiary AES Brasil Energia S.A (\"AES Brasil\") acquired \n100\n% of shares of an operational wind complex comprised of (i) Ventos de São Tomé Holding S.A., (ii) Ventos de São Tito Holdings S.A., and (iii) REB Empreendimentos e Administradora de Bens S.A. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition that did not meet the definition of a business. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their relative fair values. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $\n185\n million. The Cubico II wind complex was reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment prior to the sale of AES Brasil in October 2024.\nAgua Clara \n— On June 17, 2022, the Company, through its subsidiaries AES Dominican Renewable Energy and AES Andres DR, S.A., acquired \n100\n% of the equity interests in Agua Clara, S.A.S., a wind project, for consideration of $\n98\n million. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition that did not meet the definition of a business. As Agua Clara is not a VIE, any difference between the fair value of the assets and consideration transferred was allocated to PP&E on a relative fair value basis. Agua Clara is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\nTunica Windpower, LLC \n— On June 17, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement for the purchase of \n100\n% of the membership interests in Tunica Windpower, LLC. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition of variable interest entities that did not meet the definition of a business. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values, which equaled the fair value of the consideration paid of approximately $\n22\n million, including contingent consideration of $\n7\n million. The contingent consideration will be updated quarterly with any prospective changes in fair value recorded through earnings. Tunica Windpower is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\n192 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nWindsor PV1, LLC \n— On May 27, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement for the purchase of \n100\n% of the membership interests in Windsor PV1, LLC, an early development-stage solar project. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition of variable interest entities that did not meet the definition of a business. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values, which equaled the fair value of the consideration paid of approximately $\n17\n million, including contingent consideration of $\n5\n million. The contingent consideration will be updated quarterly with any prospective changes in fair value recorded through earnings. Windsor is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment.\n27. \nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic and diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock outstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share, includes the effects of dilutive RSUs, stock options, and equity units. The effect of such potential common stock is computed using the treasury stock method for RSUs and stock options, and is computed using the if-converted method for equity units.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation for income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, where income represents the numerator and weighted-average shares represent the denominator.\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions, except per share data)\nIncome\nShares\n$ per Share\nIncome\nShares\n$ per Share\nLoss\nShares\n$ per Share\nBASIC EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders\n$\n1,686\n \n706\n \n$\n2.39\n \n$\n242\n \n669\n \n$\n0.36\n \n$\n(\n546\n)\n668\n \n$\n(\n0.82\n)\nEFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES\nStock options\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nRestricted stock units\n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEquity units\n—\n \n5\n \n(\n0.02\n)\n1\n \n40\n \n(\n0.02\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\n$\n1,686\n \n713\n \n$\n2.37\n \n$\n243\n \n712\n \n$\n0.34\n \n$\n(\n546\n)\n668\n \n$\n(\n0.82\n)\nThe calculation of diluted earnings per share excluded \n2\n million outstanding stock awards for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which would be anti-dilutive. These stock awards could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the calculation of diluted earnings per share excluded \n5\n million outstanding stock awards and \n40\n million shares underlying our March 2021 Equity Units because their impact would be anti-dilutive given the loss from continuing operations. These shares could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future. Had the Company generated income, potential shares of common stock of \n3\n million related to the stock awards and \n40\n million related to the Equity Units would have been included in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAs described in Note 18\n—\nEquity\n, the Company issued \n10,430,500\n Equity Units in March 2021 with a total notional value of $\n1,043\n million. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $\n100\n and was initially issued as a Corporate Unit, consisting of a 2024 Purchase Contract and a \n10\n% undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Series A Preferred Stock. The conversion rate was initially \n31.5428\n shares of common stock per one share of Series A Preferred Stock, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $\n31.70\n per share of common stock. The Series A Preferred Stock and the 2024 Purchase Contracts were accounted for as one unit of account. In calculating diluted EPS, the Company has applied the if-converted method to determine the impact of the forward purchase feature and considered if there are incremental shares that should be included related to the Series A Preferred conversion value. On February 15, 2024, the Series A Preferred Stock was tendered to satisfy the Purchase Contract's settlement price and the Corporate Units were converted into shares of the Company's common stock at a settlement rate of \n3.8859\n, equivalent to a reference price of $\n25.73\n. The Series A Preferred Stock was cancelled upon conversion.\n28. \nRISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES \nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into \nfour\n technology-based SBUs. See additional discussion of the Company's principal markets in Note 19—\nSegments and Geographic Information\n. Within our \nfour\n SBUs, we have \ntwo\n primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The generation line of \n193 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nbusiness uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage.\nOperating and Economic Risks \n— The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are typically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- and an investment grade rating from Moody's of Baa3. A downgrade in our current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to finance new and/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $\n1.5\n billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\nDuring 2024, \n62\n% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S. and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. We continue to invest in several developing countries to expand our existing platform and operations. International operations, particularly the operation, financing, and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n•\neconomic, social, and political instability in any particular country or region;\n•\ninability to economically hedge energy prices;\n•\nvolatility in commodity prices;\n•\nadverse changes in currency exchange rates;\n•\ngovernment restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;\n•\nunexpected changes in foreign laws, regulatory framework, or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;\n•\nhigh inflation and monetary fluctuations;\n•\nrestrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas, or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;\n•\nthreatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;\n•\nunwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations, or other counterparties to honor their commitments;\n•\nunwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts, or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;\n•\ninability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative, and legal systems;\n•\nadverse changes in government tax policy;\n•\npotentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions;\n•\ndifficulties in enforcing our contractual rights, enforcing judgments, or obtaining a just result in local jurisdictions; and\n•\ninability to obtain financing on expected terms.\nAny of these factors, individually or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenue and earnings which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability, indexation of certain PPAs to fuel prices, and currency fluctuations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses.\nOur inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain reasonable increases in tariffs or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely \n194 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nimpact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our utility businesses where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:\n•\nchanges in the determination, definition, or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs;\n•\nchanges in the definition or determination of controllable or noncontrollable costs;\n•\nadverse changes in tax law;\n•\nchanges in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;\n•\nchanges in the timing of tariff increases;\n•\nother changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or\n•\nchanges in environmental regulations, including regulations relating to GHG emissions in any of our businesses.\nAny of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our results of operations.\nForeign Currency Risks \n— AES operates businesses in many foreign countries and such operations could be impacted by significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in currency exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies could create significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows: the Argentine peso, the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso, the Dominican peso, the Euro, and the Mexican peso.\nConcentrations \n— Due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the Company does not have any significant concentration of customers or sources of fuel supply. Several of the Company's generation businesses rely on PPAs with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant businesses' output over the term of the PPAs. However, \nno\n single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nThe cash flows and results of operations of our businesses depend on the credit quality of our customers and the continued ability of our customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under PPAs and fuel supply agreements. If a substantial portion of the Company's long-term PPAs and/or fuel supply were modified or terminated, the Company would be adversely affected to the extent that it would be unable to replace such contracts at equally favorable terms.\n29. \nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nCertain of our businesses in Panama are partially owned by governments either directly or through state-owned institutions. In the ordinary course of business, these businesses enter into energy purchase and sale transactions, and transmission agreements with other state-owned institutions which are controlled by such governments. In the Dominican Republic, AES conducts revenue generating business with parties which are investors in AES equity method investees. These business relationships affect both \nRevenue—Non-Regulated\n and C\nost of Sales—Non-Regulated\n. Furthermore, in 2021, the Company began construction projects with Fluence relating to energy storage. These related party transactions primarily present themselves as construction in progress, as seen below. Additionally, the Company provides certain support and management services to several of its affiliates under various agreements. \nThe Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations included the following transactions with related parties for the periods indicated (in millions):\nYears Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenue—Non-Regulated\n$\n746\n \n$\n1,055\n \n$\n1,093\n \nCost of Sales—Non-Regulated\n143\n \n576\n \n352\n \nCost of Sales—Regulated\n34\n \n39\n \n39\n \nInterest income\n12\n \n9\n \n10\n \nInterest expense\n26\n \n36\n \n95\n \nOther income\n23\n \n28\n \n17\n \n195 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued) | December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table summarizes the balances that relate to related party transactions for balance sheet accounts included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nReceivables from related parties\n$\n166\n \n$\n584\n \nAccounts and notes payable to related parties\n \n(1)\n1,016\n \n1,411\n \nProperty, plant, and equipment, net\n851\n \n671\n \nPrepaid expenses\n11\n \n25\n \n_____________________________\n(1)\nIncludes $\n526\n million and $\n639\n million of debt to Mong Duong Finance Holdings B.V., as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Mong Duong was classified as held-for-sale in December 2024 and 2023.\n \n30. \nRESTATEMENT (UNAUDITED)\nWe restated the unaudited quarterly financial information as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, to correct misstatements associated with the calculation of asset impairment expense for the AES Brasil disposal group. The misstatements were primarily due to the use of incomplete data in the estimation of the fair value of net assets of AES Brasil, which was used in the calculation of the impairment expense after AES Brasil was classified as held-for-sale in the second quarter of 2024. The impairment expense previously reported was overstated by $\n192\n million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and overstated by $\n5\n million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nDescription of Restatement Tables\n — See below for a reconciliation from the previously reported amounts in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to the restated amounts as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These amounts are labeled as \"Previously Reported\" in the table below. The amounts labeled \"Adjustments\" represent the effects of this restatement.\nEffects of the Restatement on Quarterly Results (Unaudited)\n — The tables below illustrate the impact of the restatement on the historical unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity for the interim quarters impacted, each as compared with the amounts presented in the Form 10-Qs previously filed with the SEC.\nSince the restatement is associated with the calculation of asset impairment expense, a non-cash activity, there was no impact to net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, or financing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The restatement resulted in an increase to \nNet income \nand an offsetting decrease to \nImpairment expense\n of $\n192\n million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and an increase to \nNet income \nand an offsetting decrease to \nImpairment expense \nof $\n197\n million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited)\nJune 30,

initiated a restructuring program to streamline our organization given the significantly lower number of countries that we operate in. Additionally, we are right sizing our development company to focus on executing on the backlog and pursuing larger but fewer projects to better serve our core customers. This program is not expected to have an impact on the Company's operating segments.\nAES Dominican Renewable Energy\n —\n On February 6, 2025, AES Dominican Renewable Energy failed to comply with a covenant on its debt, resulting in a technical default. See Note 12—\nObligations\n for further information. AES Dominican Renewable Energy is reported in the Renewables SBU reportable segment and was classified as held-for-sale in the current period. See Note 25—\nHeld-For-Sale and Dispositions\n for further information.\nAES Ohio\n — On March 5, 2025, DPL received approval from the PUCO for the previously announced sale of an aggregate indirect equity interest of approximately 30% in AES Ohio to CDPQ.\n202 | 2024 Annual Report\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nThe Company carried out the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements are prevented or detected timely.\nManagement, including the CEO and CFO, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 and has concluded that we did not design effective controls over the review of the disposition of AES Brasil, a complex non-routine transaction; specifically due to the use of incomplete data in the estimation of the fair value of the net assets of AES Brasil, which was used in calculation of the impairment expense after AES Brasil was classified as Held for Sale in Q2 2024. The result of which caused an overstatement of impairment expense that was calculated in Q2 2024 and Q3 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") in 2013. \nManagement continues to implement measures designed to ensure that the control deficiency contributing to the material weakness is remediated. The remediation actions include: (i) policy updates detailing steps to perform in an impairment analysis of complex ownership structures, (ii) detailed instructions on considerations to be included in the fair value estimations, (iii) updates to Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations policies, and (iv) training to impacted personnel. \nAs of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management believes we have made progress toward remediating the underlying causes of the material weakness. We believe these actions will remediate the forgoing material weakness. The material weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. Management expects to begin remediation efforts immediately and be completed by June 30, 2025.\nNotwithstanding the identified material weakness, as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management, including our CEO and CFO, believes that the audited consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented and such financial statements are presented in conformity with GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:\n203 | 2024 Annual Report\nOther than the material weakness discussed above, there were no changes that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n204 | 2024 Annual Report\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The AES Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited The AES Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, The AES Corporation (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in controls related to the Company’s disposition process related to AES Brasil.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 10, 2025 which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n205 | 2024 Annual Report\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nTysons, Virginia\nMarch 10, 2025 \n206 | 2024 Annual Report\nITEM 9B.
