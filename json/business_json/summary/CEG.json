  "item1_summary": " The market price for electricity is also affected by changes in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity . Unfavorable economic conditions, milder than normal weather, and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response programs can depress demand . The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in higher interest rates and capital costs, increased costs of labor, and other similar effects .\n We are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could, over time, affect or transform the energy industry . Advancements in both distributed and utility-scale power generation technology could impact market prices and demand size and behaviors . These developments could affect the price of energy, levels of customer-owned generation, customer expectations and current business models .\n A decline in the market value of the NDT fund investments could increase our funding requirements to decommission our nuclear plants . We rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet our fina requirements . We could be negatively affected by unstable capital and credit markets and increased volatility in commodity markets .\n Disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the U.S. or abroad could negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets or draw on our bank revolving credit facilities . The banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity . As of December 31, 2024, approximately 35%, 11%, and 20% of our available credit facilities were with European, Canadian, and Asian banks .\n If we were to experience a downgrade in our credit ratings to below investment grade, we would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral that could affect our liquidity and we could experience higher borrowing costs . We are also subject to certain financial requirements under NRC regulations as a result of our operation of nuclear power plants that could require us to provide cash collateral .\n Failure to meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings could give rise to a project-specific financing default . The impact of bankruptcy could result in the impairment of certain project assets . Risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the risk associated with our commodity trading activities . See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information .\n Factors, such as future prices and demand for power, natural gas and other energy-related commodities, become more difficult to predict . As a result, we cannot predict the impact that our commodity trading activities and risk management decisions could have on our consolidated financial statements . Financial performance and load requirements could be negatively affected if we are unable to manage our power portfolio .\n We could be negatively affected by the impacts of weather, which impacts demand for electricity and natural gas, the price of energy commodities, as well as operating conditions . Extreme weather conditions or storms could affect the availability of generation and the transmission of electricity, limiting our ability to source electricity or transmit it to our customers . Long-lived assets, goodwill, and other assets could become impaired .\n We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount . Changes in significant assumptions, including discount rates, energy prices, projected operating costs, and cash flows could potentially result in future impairments of goodwill .\n In the bilateral markets, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from us will not perform under their obligations . In the event the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we could be forced to purchase or sell energy in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and incur additional losses . We are also a party to agreements with entities in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrades or other financial difficulties .\n Approximately 70% of our generating resources, which include directly owned assets and capacity obtained through long-term contracts, are in the area encompassed by PJM . FERC’s and PJM's level of support for policies that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power markets, recognize the value of emissions-free electricity and resiliency .\n The PTC benefiting existing nuclear plants included in the IRA (starting January 1, 2024) continues to be the subject of additional guidance issued from the U.S. Treasury and IRS . A change in the Atomic Energy Act or the applicable regulations or licenses could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or could result in increased operating or decommissioning costs .\n The timing and availability of a repository for SNF could adversely affect our ability to decommission fully our nuclear units . We could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards . We cannot predict whether a fee may be established or to what extent, in the future for disposal of SNF .\n Changes to current state legislation or the development of federal legislation that requires the use of clean, renewable and alternate fuel sources could significantly impact us . The impact could include reduced use of some of our generating facilities with effects on our operating revenues and costs . Federal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs and new energy consumption technologies could cause declines in customer energy consumption .\n FERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways, federal lands, or connected to the interstate electric grid . We could also lose operating revenues and incur increased purchased power and fuel expense to meet our supply commitments . Conditions could be imposed as part of the license renewal process that could adversely affect operations .\n The company is involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising from its business operations . Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures, result in loss of revenue, or restrict existing business activities . The company could be subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight .\n Climate adaptation risk refers to risks to our facilities or operations that may result from changes in the physical climate, such as changes to temperatures, weather patterns and sea level rise . Over time, we may need to make additional investments to protect our facilities from physical climate-related risks . Changes to the climate may impact levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services, which could affect our operations .\n Our financial performance could be negatively affected by matters arising from our ownership and operation of nuclear facilities . Nuclear capacity factors for nuclear generating units significantly affect our results of operations . Nuclear fuel quality could affect the efficiency and costs of our operations . The potential competitive advantage offered by our low-carbon emission profile may be reduced .\n Operations at any of our nuclear generation plants could degrade to the point where we must shut down the plant or operate at less than full capacity . We could choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity. We could also incur liability to our co-owners for plants operated but not wholly owned by us .\n The consequences of a major incident could be severe and include loss of life and property damage . An accident or other significant event at a nuclear plant within the U.S. or abroad, whether owned by us or others, could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy . We carry the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance, $500 million for each operating site .\n Actual costs to decommission our nuclear facilities may substantially exceed our estimates as a result of changes in the approach and timing of decommissioning activities . We have recourse to collect additional amounts from utility customers through PECO (subject to certain limitations and thresholds) for former PECo units and through CenterPoint and AEP Texas for STP units .\n If the investments held by our NDT funds are not sufficient to fund the decommissioning of our nuclear units, we could be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees . Security incidents such as ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe . geopolitical issues, to include conflicts in the Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as tensions between the U.S. and China, may motivate cyber-attacks .\n A failure, interruption, or breach of our operational or information security systems could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, cause loss of customers or revenue, increase our costs and/or cause other losses . Security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent actions by our employees, third-party service providers .\n We may be subject to short- and long-term interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability due to third-party cybersecurity or reliability incidents that are outside of our direct control . We expect that in the future we may experience interruptions . We cannot anticipate, detect, repel, or implement fully effective preventative measures against all cyber threats .\n Future attacks or reliability may negatively impact our business, reputation, or financial results . We have not experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems . New or updated security regulations or new vulnerabilities identified by security researchers, third-party suppliers, or threat actors could require changes in current measures taken by security or our business operations .\n Nuclear accidents, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemic and other significant events could negatively impact our results of operations, ability to raise capital, and future growth . As a result, employees, contractors and the general public are at some risk for serious injury, including loss of life . The impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry and on us is uncertain .\n Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession or other factors also could result in a decline in energy consumption or interruption of fuel or the supply chain . In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs .\n Our performance could be negatively affected if we fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce . In 2024 we announced the planned restart of our Crane nuclear generation facility which will require hiring skilled employees to restart and operate the plant . We are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for generation operations .\n This could include opportunistic carbon-free energy acquisitions, creating new value from our existing fleet through nuclear uprates, renewable repowerings, co-location of customer load . Such initiatives could involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered during diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering a market .\n We may encounter difficulties in satisfying the conditions for the completion of the merger, including obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals, within the expected time frame or at all . We cannot provide assurance that all required regulatory approvals will be obtained or that these approvals will not contain terms, conditions or restrictions that would be unacceptable . We are expecting to sell certain of the combined company’s PJM natural-gas-fired generating assets .\n If the merger is not completed by December 31, 2025 (which date may be automatically extended to June 1, 2026) The share price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption by the market that the merger will be completed . We cannot assure that we will continue paying dividends at the current rate .\n Current shareholders and former Calpine stockholders would own approximately 85% and 15% of the outstanding shares of Constellation common stock . The merger may not be accretive to earnings and may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. We have incurred and will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs .\n The integration process will be complex, costly and time-consuming . We expect that the elimination of costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies, will exceed incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time . We may incur additional unanticipated costs in the integration of the businesses, which could negatively impact our operating results .\n The companies have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently . It is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of, or the loss of momentum . The merger may divert significant attention to Calpine’s generating assets and the costs to operate and maintain them, relative to expectations .\n The pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration could place a burden on management and internal resources . A significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process may negatively impact our financial results . The combined company’s assets, liabilities or results of operations could be negatively impacted by unknown or unexpected events, conditions or actions that might occur at Calpine prior to the closing .\n The amount of goodwill, which could be material, will be allocated to the appropriate reporting units of the combined company . Any excess of consideration transferred over the fair values of Calpine’s assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill . The number of shares we expect to issue in connection with the stock consideration will not be adjusted for changes in the price of our common stock, which may vary significantly .\n The merger may be completed on terms different from those contained in the Merger Agreement . Lawsuits may be filed against us or our Board in connection with the merger . An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the merger and/or substantial costs to us . We are not aware of any pending or threatened lawsuits relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger.\n The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed may adversely affect the combined company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . Constellation has established programs and processes to manage material risks from cybersecurity threats including assessing and identifying existing cybersecurity risks, as well as continuously monitoring for developing risks .\n Our cybersecurity and physical security controls are implemented through policies and procedures we utilize for planning, performing, managing, assessing, innovating, and improving our security controls . We implement practices for training and screening of personnel, access management, network defense, vulnerability assessment, third-party security, and privacy and information protection . Our cybersecurity program is aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework .\n If the company is the target of a cybersecurity attack, we have established processes for incident response and crisis management . These processes require notifications to regulatory and other governmental authorities of cybersecurity events as required by law . For our regulated cyber assets associated with critical infrastructure, such as those within the scope of NERC and the NRC, regulatory auditors and inspectors monitor our adherence to mandatory cybersecurity requirements on a regular frequency using a variety of compliance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms .\n The Nuclear Oversight Committee is tasked with overseeing compliance with policies and procedures to manage and mitigate cybersecurity risks associated with our nuclear assets . The Audit and Risk Committee oversees policies and processes established by management to identify, assess, monitor, manage and control technology and cyber risks . Emergent matters or events are reported to the Board between scheduled meetings on an ad hoc basis .\n The risks from cyber threats have not materially affected our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition to date, we continue to closely monitor cyber risk . Overall, our company has implemented tactical processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats to the company including governance at the Board level and accountability in our executive management for the execution of our cyber risk management strategy ."
