MD&A is organized as follows:\n•\nOverview.\n    This section provides a general description of our business, global economic conditions and industry trends, and a summary of our financial performance for Fiscal 2025. In addition, this section includes a discussion of recent developments and transactions affecting comparability that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition, and in anticipating future trends.\n•\nResults of operations.\n    This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 as compared to the respective prior fiscal year.\n•\nFinancial condition and liquidity.\n    This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity as of March 29, 2025, which includes (i) an analysis of our financial condition as compared to the prior fiscal year-end; (ii) an analysis of changes in our cash flows for Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 as compared to the respective prior fiscal year; (iii) an analysis of our liquidity, including the availability under our commercial paper borrowing program and credit facilities, our supplier finance program, outstanding debt and covenant compliance, common stock repurchases, and payments of dividends; and (iv) a summary of our material cash requirements as of March 29, 2025.\n•\nMarket risk management.\n    This section discusses how we manage our risk exposures related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and our investments as of March 29, 2025.\n•\nCritical accounting policies.\n    This section discusses our critical accounting policies considered to be important to our results of operations and financial condition, which typically require significant judgment and estimation on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n•\nRecently issued accounting standards.\n    This section discusses the potential impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition of certain accounting standards that have been recently issued.\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nOur Company is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of luxury lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear & accessories, home, fragrances, and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands, distribution channels, and international markets. Our brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Double RL, Polo Ralph Lauren, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, and Chaps, among others.\nWe diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel categories, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.\n44\nWe organize our business into the following three reportable segments: \n•\nNorth America \n— Our North America segment, representing approximately 43% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses primarily in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our outlet stores, and our digital commerce sites, www.RalphLauren.com and www.RalphLauren.ca. Our wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and, to a lesser extent, specialty stores.\n•\nEurope \n— Our Europe segment, representing approximately 31% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Europe and emerging markets. In Europe, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our outlet stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Europe is comprised primarily of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital and licensee partners.\n•\nAsia \n— Our Asia segment, representing approximately 24% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Our retail business in Asia is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our outlet stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. In addition, we sell our products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Asia is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and various third-party digital and licensee partners.\nNo operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments, representing approximately 2% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues, which primarily consist of Ralph Lauren and Chaps branded royalty revenues earned through our global licensing alliances.\nApproximately 57% of our Fiscal 2025 net revenues were earned outside of the U.S. See Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.\nOur business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and the macroeconomic environment, including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income (loss), and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns.\nRecent Developments\nNext Generation Transformation Project\nWe are in the early stages of executing a large-scale, multi-year global project that is expected to significantly transform the way in which we operate our business and further enable our long-term strategic pivot towards a global direct-to-consumer-oriented model (the \"Next Generation Transformation project\" or \"NGT project\"). The NGT project will be completed in phases and involves the redesigning of certain end-to-end processes and the implementation of a suite of technology systems on a global scale. Such efforts are expected to result in significant process improvements and the creation of synergies across core areas of operations, including merchandise buying and planning, procurement, inventory management, retail and wholesale operations, and financial planning and reporting, better enabling us to optimize inventory levels and increase the speed with which we react to changes in consumer demand across markets, among other benefits.  \nIn connection with the preliminary phase of the NGT project, we incurred other charges of $25.2 million and $5.1 million during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively, which were recorded within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations. \n45\nGlobal Economic Conditions and Industry Trends\nThe global economy and retail industry are impacted by many uncontrollable factors. Most recently, the U.S. announced significant changes to its trade policies, including widespread tariff increases on imported goods, with potential further increases and revisions or terminations to existing trade agreements. In response, many countries have announced or are otherwise considering retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports and other trade restrictions. This has led to significant uncertainty regarding the future relationship between the U.S. and other countries, as well as growing concerns about a global trade war, higher inflation, and a potential global recession, which has already caused significant volatility of global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rates. \nOther recent economic conditions, including ongoing inflationary pressures, organized labor disputes, high interest rates, significant foreign currency volatility, and military conflicts (as discussed below), continue to impact consumer discretionary income levels, spending, and sentiment in the U.S. and beyond. In response to such pressures, as well as to reduce elevated inventory levels, many retailers (particularly in the U.S.) continue to resort to promotional activity in an attempt to offset traffic declines and increase conversion. Furthermore, the department store sector has also experienced consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies, and other ownership changes in recent times, as well as an increase in store closures. \nThe global economy has also been negatively impacted by ongoing military conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, militant attacks on cargo vessels in the Red Sea, and other hostilities in the Middle East. Although our voluntary decision to suspend operations in Russia has not resulted in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and our ongoing operations in Israel are also not material, our business has been, and may continue to be, affected by the broader macroeconomic implications resulting from these and other military conflicts, including inflationary pressures, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, increases in energy prices, food shortages, and financial market volatility, among other factors, which have adversely impacted consumer sentiment and confidence. It is not clear at this time how long these conflicts will endure, or if they will escalate further with additional countries declaring war against each other, which could further amplify the impacts of the various macroeconomic factors described above and potentially result in a global recession.\nThe global supply chain has also been negatively impacted by various factors, including disruptions at U.S. ports and in the Red Sea. Although our business has not been significantly impacted by such disruptions, we have experienced some shipping delays impacting the timing of inventory receipts, and if such disruptions were to continue over a prolonged period, it could result in further inventory receipt delays and/or higher freight costs in the near-term and beyond.\nWe have implemented various global strategies to address many of these challenges and continue to build a foundation for long-term profitable growth by strengthening our consumer-facing areas and driving a more efficient operating model. We continue to monitor the current geopolitical landscape, including the potential impact of higher tariffs should they become effective. We have taken proactive measures in recent years to diversify our supply chain from a geographic perspective and believe we can further mitigate potential cost pressures associated with new tariffs through a combination of our disciplined inventory management, leveraging our relationships with suppliers to reduce product costs, our ability to change country of origin, and pricing actions. However, should the proposed tariffs become effective, our profitability will be negatively impacted. Regarding mitigating inflationary pressures, our strategy includes numerous levers, including our ability to effectively increase prices, leveraging our diversified supply chain and strong supplier relationships, and leveraging our in-house quality control to reduce time and cost from the manufacturing process, among other efforts. Despite the competitive environment, we plan to continue driving our broader long-term strategy of brand elevation, which includes multiple levers to continue driving average unit retail growth and brand equity.\nWe will continue to monitor these conditions and trends and adjust our operating strategies to help mitigate the related impacts on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting and elevating the value of our brand.\nFor a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part I,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n\" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n46\nSummary of Financial Performance\nOperating Results\nIn Fiscal 2025, we reported net revenues of $7.079 billion, net income of $742.9 million, and net income per diluted share of $11.61, as compared to net revenues of $6.631 billion, net income of $646.3 million, and net income per diluted share of $9.71 in Fiscal 2024. The comparability of our operating results has been affected by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits), as well as foreign currency volatility. Our operating results are also susceptible to changes in macroeconomic conditions.\nOur operating performance for Fiscal 2025 reflected revenue increases of 6.8% on a reported basis and 7.7% on a constant currency basis, as defined within \"\nTransactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n\"\n \nbelow. Net revenues reflected growth across all of our reportable segments.\n Our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by 180 basis points to 68.6% during Fiscal 2025, primarily driven by the favorable geographic, channel, and product mix, average unit retail (\"AUR\") growth, and lower cotton costs, more than offsetting incremental pressure from non-cotton product costs and unfavorable foreign currency effects.\nSelling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased by 30 basis points to 54.6% during Fiscal 2025, largely attributable to geographic and channel mix, as well as increases across various expense categories, including higher compensation-related expenses and higher marketing investments due to planned key campaign events.\nNet income increased by $96.6 million to $742.9 million in Fiscal 2025 as compared to Fiscal 2024, primarily due to a $175.7 million increase in our operating income, partially offset by a $76.7 million increase in our income tax provision. Net income per diluted share increased by $1.90 to $11.61 per share during Fiscal 2025 driven by the higher level of net income and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nDuring Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, our operating results were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $57.8 million and $69.9 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $46.0 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, and $52.6 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, respectively. Net income during Fiscal 2024 also reflected an income tax benefit of $13.1 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, recorded in connection with non-recurring income tax events.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nWe ended Fiscal 2025 in a net cash and short-term investments position (calculated as cash and cash equivalents, plus short-term investments, less total debt) of $940.4 million, as compared to $642.7 million as of the end of Fiscal 2024. The increase in our net cash and short-term investments position during Fiscal 2025 as compared to Fiscal 2024 was primarily due to our operating cash flows of $1.235 billion, partially offset by our use of cash to support Class A common stock repurchases of $480.9 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through $216.2 million in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of $201.1 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.235 billion during Fiscal 2025, as compared to $1.070 billion during Fiscal 2024. The net increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to an increase in net income before non-cash charges, as well as a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nOur equity increased to $2.589 billion as of March 29, 2025, compared to $2.450 billion as of March 30, 2024 due to our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements, partially offset by our share repurchase activity and dividends declared during Fiscal 2025.\n47\nTransactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nThe comparability of our operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain events, including:\n•\npretax charges incurred in connection with our restructuring activities, as well as certain other benefits (charges) as summarized below (references to \"Notes\" are to the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements):\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\n \n(millions)\nRestructuring and other charges, net (see Note 9)\n$\n(57.0)\n$\n(74.9)\n$\n(43.0)\nNon-routine inventory benefits (charges)\n(a)\n \n— \n4.5 \n(15.4)\nImpairment of assets (see Note 8)\n(0.8)\n— \n(9.7)\nNon-routine bad debt expense reversals\n(b)\n \n— \n0.5 \n2.1 \nTotal charges, net\n$\n(57.8)\n$\n(69.9)\n$\n(66.0)\n \n(a)\nNon-routine inventory benefits (charges) are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. The benefits recorded during Fiscal 2024 primarily related to reversals of amounts previously recognized in connection with delays in U.S. customs shipment reviews and approvals (approximately $3 million) and the COVID-19 pandemic (approximately $2 million). Non-routine inventory charges, net recorded during Fiscal 2023 primarily related to the Russia-Ukraine war (approximately $10 million) and delays in U.S. customs shipment reviews and approvals (approximately $5 million). \n(b)\nNon-routine bad debt expense reversals are recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-routine bad debt reversals, net recorded during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 primarily related to charges previously recognized in connection with the Russia-Ukraine war.\n•\na one-time tax benefit of $13.1 million recorded within our income tax provision during Fiscal 2024 in connection with Swiss tax reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, which decreased our Fiscal 2024 effective tax rate by 170 basis points. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nBecause we are a global company, the comparability of our operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is also affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"), our discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. We present constant currency financial information, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to our reported operating results. We use constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe this information is useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in our businesses. The constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included in the \"Results of Operations\" section where applicable.\nOur discussion also includes reference to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the change in sales of our stores that have been open for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales from our digital commerce sites are also included within comparable sales for those geographies that have been serviced by the related site for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales for stores or digital commerce sites that are closed or shut down during the year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater), or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have been operating in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least 13 full fiscal months. All comparable store sales metrics are calculated on a 52-week and constant currency basis. \nOur \"Results of Operations\" discussion that follows includes the significant changes in operating results arising from these items affecting comparability. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users should consider the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends.\n48\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal 2025 Compared to Fiscal 2024\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 68.6% in Fiscal 2025 from 66.8% in Fiscal 2024. The 180 basis point improvement was primarily driven by the favorable impact of approximately 70 basis points attributable to geographic and channel mix. The remaining 110 basis point improvement was primarily due to AUR growth of approximately high-single digits, lower cotton costs, and favorable product mix, more than offsetting incremental pressure from non-cotton products costs and unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 20 basis points.\nGross profit is the difference between total net revenues and cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes the amounts incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale to our customers, including product costs, freight-in, and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. Gains and losses associated with forward foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of inventory transactions are also recognized within cost of goods sold when the hedged inventory is sold. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing, and order charges, are included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities.\n51\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses.\n    SG&A expenses include costs relating to compensation and benefits, marketing and advertising, rent and occupancy, distribution, information technology, legal, depreciation and amortization, bad debt, and other selling and administrative costs. SG&A expenses increased by $262.5 million, or 7.3%, to $3.863 billion in Fiscal 2025, including favorable foreign currency effects of $30.8 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 54.6% in Fiscal 2025 from 54.3% in Fiscal 2024. The 30 basis point increase was largely attributable to geographic and channel mix resulting from growth of our international and retail businesses which typically carry higher operating expense margins, as well as increases across various expense categories, including higher compensation-related expenses and marketing investments due to planned key campaign events.\nThe $262.5 million increase in SG&A expenses was driven by:\nFiscal 2025\nCompared to \nFiscal 2024\n(millions)\nSG&A expense category:\nCompensation-related expenses\n$\n118.6 \nMarketing and advertising expenses\n49.3 \nRent and occupancy costs\n30.2 \nNon-income-related taxes\n24.0 \nSelling-related expenses\n17.6 \nOther\n22.8 \nTotal increase in SG&A expenses\n$\n262.5 \nImpairment of Assets.\n    During Fiscal 2025, we recorded impairment charges of $0.8 million to write-down long-lived assets in connection with certain North America wholesale shops that are expected to close earlier than the end of their original estimated useful life due to the related customer declaring bankruptcy. On a comparative basis, no impairment charges were recorded during Fiscal 2024. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRestructuring and Other Charges, Net.\n   During Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, we recorded net restructuring charges of $20.4 million and $55.8 million, respectively, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, as well as other charges of $11.4 million and $14.0 million, respectively, primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations in connection with our restructuring activities for which the related lease agreements have not yet expired. In addition, during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, we recorded other charges of $25.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in connection with our Next Generation Transformation project (refer to \n\"Recent Developments\"\n for additional discussion) and recorded other income of $2.8 million and $7.0 million, respectively, related to consideration received from Regent, L.P. in connection with our previously sold Club Monaco business. We donated this income to The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, a non-profit, charitable foundation, which resulted in related offsetting donation expenses of $2.8 million and $7.0 million during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Income.\n    Operating income increased by $175.7 million, or 23.2%, to $932.1 million during Fiscal 2025, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency effects of $32.0 million. Our operating results during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $57.8 million and $69.9 million, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 13.2% in Fiscal 2025, reflecting a 180 basis point improvement from Fiscal 2024. The improvement in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by the increase in our gross margin, as well as lower net restructuring-related charges and certain other charges (benefits) recorded during Fiscal 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, all as previously discussed.\n52\nOperating income and margin for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's operating margin from the prior fiscal year, are provided below:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \n \nMarch 29, 2025\nMarch 30, 2024\n \n \nOperating\nIncome\nOperating\nMargin\nOperating\nIncome\nOperating\nMargin\n$\nChange\nMargin\nChange\n(millions)\n \n(millions)\n \n(millions)\n \nSegment:\nNorth America\n$\n640.1 \n21.0%\n$\n548.9 \n18.6%\n$\n91.2 \n240 bps\nEurope\n566.2 \n26.0%\n464.6 \n23.6%\n101.6 \n240 bps\nAsia\n413.2 \n24.2%\n335.9 \n21.4%\n77.3 \n280 bps\nOther non-reportable segments\n \n125.8 \n87.0%\n128.9 \n88.1%\n(3.1)\n(110 bps)\nTotal segment operating income\n1,745.3 \n1,478.3 \n267.0 \nCorporate expenses, net\n(755.4)\n(647.0)\n(108.4)\nImpairment of assets\n(a)\n \n(0.8)\n— \n(0.8)\nRestructuring and other charges, net\n(a)\n \n(57.0)\n(74.9)\n17.9 \nTotal operating income\n$\n932.1 \n13.2%\n$\n756.4 \n11.4%\n$\n175.7 \n180 bps\n(a)\nSee discussion above for additional information related to impairment of assets and restructuring and other charges, net recorded during the fiscal years presented.\nNorth America operating margin\n improved by 240 basis points due to an increase of 230 basis points in gross margin and a decline of 10 basis points in SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenues. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of the unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points attributable to channel mix. \nEurope operating margin\n improved by 240 basis points entirely due to an increase in gross margin. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of the unfavorable impacts of approximately 30 basis points and 20 basis points related to foreign currency effects and channel mix, respectively. \nAsia operating margin\n improved by 280 basis points due to a decline of 190 basis points in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues and an increase of 80 basis points in gross margin. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of the unfavorable impacts of approximately 50 basis points and 20 basis points related to foreign currency effects and channel mix, respectively. \nCorporate expenses\n increased by $108.4 million to $755.4 million in Fiscal 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in corporate expenses was due to higher compensation-related expenses of $50.7 million, higher non-income taxes of $23.9 million, higher marketing and advertising expenses of $13.5 million, lower intercompany sourcing commission of $9.3 million (which is offset at the segment level and eliminates in consolidation), lower non-routine inventory benefits of $4.5 million, and higher other expenses of $22.8 million, partially offset by lower rent and occupancy expenses of $16.3 million.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net.\n    Non-operating income (expense), net is comprised of interest expense, interest income, and other income (expense), net, which includes foreign currency gains (losses), equity in income (losses) from our equity-method investees, and other non-operating expenses. During Fiscal 2025, we reported non-operating income, net, of $18.6 million as compared to $21.0 million during Fiscal 2024. The $2.4 million decrease in non-operating income, net was primarily driven by higher interest expense.\nIncome Tax Provision.\n    The income tax provision represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate will change from period to period based on various factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies.\n53\nThe income tax provision and effective tax rate in Fiscal 2025 were $207.8 million and 21.9%, respectively, compared to $131.1 million and 16.9%, respectively, in Fiscal 2024. The $76.7 million increase in our income tax provision was primarily driven by an increase in our pretax income, as well as a 500 basis point increase in our effective tax rate. The increase in our effective tax rate was due to the absence of prior year favorable adjustments related to the accrual of deferred tax assets in connection with a transaction entered into as part of a reorganization of our corporate entity structure, and revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of tax rate changes enacted in the prior year period, partially offset by a current year favorable adjustment related to the revaluation of a deferred tax liability on foreign earnings. The increase in our effective tax rate was also due to the absence of a one-time tax benefit of $13.1 million recorded during Fiscal 2024 in connection with Swiss tax reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, which lowered our prior fiscal year period effective tax rate by 170 basis points. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNet Income.\n    Net income increased to $742.9 million in Fiscal 2025, from $646.3 million in Fiscal 2024. The $96.6 million increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in our operating income, partially offset by an increase in our income tax provision, both as previously discussed. Our operating results during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $57.8 million and $69.9 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $46.0 million and $52.6 million, respectively. Net income during Fiscal 2024 also reflected an income tax benefit of $13.1 million recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, as previously discussed.\nNet Income per Diluted Share.\n    Net income per diluted share increased to $11.61 in Fiscal 2025, from $9.71 in Fiscal 2024. The $1.90 per share increase was primarily driven by the higher level of net income, as previously discussed, and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during Fiscal 2025 driven by our share repurchases during the last twelve months. Net income per diluted share for Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were also negatively impacted by $0.72 per share and $0.80 per share, respectively, attributable to net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits), as previously discussed. Net income per diluted share during Fiscal 2024 was also favorably impacted by $0.20 due to an income tax benefit recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, as previously discussed.\n54\nFiscal 2024 Compared to Fiscal 2023\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions.

On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $81.5 million, reflecting increases of $66.7 million in comparable store sales and $14.8 million in non-comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable store sales reflected low-teens AUR growth during Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023, as well as higher traffic.

On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $194.9 million, or 13.7%. \nThe $139.9 million increase in Asia net revenues was driven by: \n•\na $141.7 million increase related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of unfavorable foreign currency effects of $51.5 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $193.2 million, reflecting increases of $116.9 million in comparable store sales and $76.3 million in non-comparable store sales. The increase in our comparable store sales reflected low-teens AUR growth during Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023, as well as higher traffic.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 66.8% in Fiscal 2024 from 64.6% in Fiscal 2023. The 220 basis point improvement was primarily driven by the favorable impacts of approximately 90 basis points attributable to geographic and channel mix and 30 basis points attributable to lower non-routine inventory charges recorded during Fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The remaining 100 basis point improvement was primarily due to lower freight costs and AUR growth of approximately low-double digits, more than offsetting incremental pressure from higher cotton costs and unfavorable foreign currency effects of 20 basis points.\n57\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses.\n    SG&A expenses increased by $191.6 million, or 5.6%, to $3.600 billion in Fiscal 2024, including favorable foreign currency effects of $11.4 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 54.3% in Fiscal 2024 from 52.9% in Fiscal 2023. The 140 basis point increase was largely attributable to geographic and channel mix resulting from growth of our international and retail businesses which typically carry higher operating expense margins.\nThe $191.6 million increase in SG&A expenses was driven by:\nFiscal 2024\nCompared to \nFiscal 2023\n(millions)\nSG&A expense category:\nCompensation-related expenses\n$\n108.2 \nRent and occupancy costs\n30.9 \nMarketing and advertising expenses\n28.9 \nDepreciation and amortization expense\n8.3 \nOther\n15.3 \nTotal increase in SG&A expenses\n$\n191.6 \nImpairment of Assets.\n    No impairment charges were recorded during Fiscal 2024. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2023, we recorded impairment charges of $9.7 million to write-down certain long-lived assets, primarily related to a certain previously exited real estate location for which the related lease agreement had not yet expired. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRestructuring and Other Charges, Net.\n   During Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, we recorded net restructuring charges and benefits of $55.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, as well as other charges of $14.0 million and $23.8 million, respectively, primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations in connection with our restructuring activities for which the related lease agreements had not yet expired. In addition, during Fiscal 2024 we recorded other charges of $5.1 million in connection with our Next Generation Transformation project (refer to \n\"Recent Developments\"\n for additional discussion). Additionally, during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, we recognized income of $7.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, related to consideration received from Regent, L.P. in connection with our previously sold Club Monaco business. We donated this income to The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, which resulted in related offsetting donation expenses of $7.0 million and $3.5 million during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, respectively. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Income.\n    Operating income increased by $52.2 million, or 7.4%, to $756.4 million during Fiscal 2024, reflecting favorable foreign currency effects of $6.5 million. Our operating results during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $69.9 million and $66.0 million, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues was 11.4% in Fiscal 2024, reflecting a 50 basis point improvement from Fiscal 2023. The improvement in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by the increase in our gross margin, partially offset by the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, both as previously discussed.\n58\nOperating income and margin for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's operating margin from the prior fiscal year, are provided below:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \n \nMarch 30, 2024\nApril 1, 2023\n \n \nOperating\nIncome\nOperating\nMargin\nOperating\nIncome\nOperating\nMargin\n$\nChange\nMargin\nChange\n(millions)\n \n(millions)\n \n(millions)\n \nSegment:\nNorth America\n$\n548.9 \n18.6%\n$\n565.1 \n18.7%\n$\n(16.2)\n(10 bps)\nEurope\n464.6 \n23.6%\n407.3 \n22.1%\n57.3 \n150 bps\nAsia\n335.9 \n21.4%\n289.6 \n20.3%\n46.3 \n110 bps\nOther non-reportable segments\n \n128.9 \n88.1%\n146.4 \n93.1%\n(17.5)\n(500 bps)\nTotal segment operating income\n1,478.3 \n1,408.4 \n69.9 \nCorporate expenses\n(a)\n \n(647.0)\n(651.5)\n4.5 \nImpairment of assets\n(a)\n \n— \n(9.7)\n9.7 \nRestructuring and other charges, net\n(74.9)\n(43.0)\n(31.9)\nTotal operating income\n$\n756.4 \n11.4%\n$\n704.2 \n10.9%\n$\n52.2 \n50 bps\n(a)\nSee discussion above for additional information related to impairment of assets and restructuring and other charges, net recorded during the fiscal years presented.\nNorth America operating margin\n declined by 10 basis points due to an increase of 240 basis points in SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenues, more than offsetting an increase of 230 basis points in gross margin. The overall decline in operating margin was inclusive of the unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points attributable to channel mix. \nEurope operating margin\n improved by 150 basis points due to an increase of 240 basis points in gross margin, more than offsetting an increase of 90 basis points in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of favorable foreign currency effects of 20 basis points and the unfavorable impact of 40 basis points related to channel mix. \nAsia operating margin\n improved by 110 basis points due to decline of 140 basis points in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, more than offsetting a decline in gross margin of 20 basis points. The overall improvement in operating margin was inclusive of unfavorable foreign currency effects of 20 basis points. \nCorporate expenses\n decreased by $4.5 million to $647.0 million in Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023. The decrease in corporate expenses was due to lower non-routine inventory charges recorded during Fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year of $19.9 million, lower rent and occupancy expenses of $6.6 million, lower marketing and advertising expenses of $6.4 million, lower depreciation and amortization expenses of $5.6 million, lower consulting fees of $5.1 million, lower selling-related expenses of $4.6 million, and lower other expenses of $6.8 million, partially offset by higher compensation-related expenses of $50.5 million. \nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net.\n    During Fiscal 2024, we reported non-operating income, net, of $21.0 million as compared to non-operating expense, net of $12.3 million during Fiscal 2023. The $33.3 million increase in non-operating income, net was mainly due to a $40.8 million increase in interest income driven by higher interest rates in financial markets and higher average on-hand cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance during Fiscal 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense and other expense, net.\n59\nIncome Tax Provision.\n    The income tax provision and effective tax rate in Fiscal 2024 were $131.1 million and 16.9%, respectively, compared to $169.2 million and 24.5%, respectively, in Fiscal 2023. The $38.1 million decrease in our income tax provision was primarily driven by the 760 basis point decline in our effective tax rate, partially offset by an increase in our pretax income. The decline in our effective tax rate was due to a deferred tax benefit recognized as a result of transactions entered into as part of a reorganization of the Company's legal entity structure, the favorable impact of remeasuring net deferred tax assets as a result of changes enacted in tax legislation, and the absence of unfavorable prior year adjustments related to certain deferred tax assets and receivables, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of audit-related reserve adjustments. The decline in our effective tax rate was also due to a one-time tax benefit of $13.1 million recorded during Fiscal 2024 in connection with Swiss tax reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, which lowered our effective tax rate by 170 basis points. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNet Income.\n    Net income increased to $646.3 million in Fiscal 2024, from $522.7 million in Fiscal 2023. The $123.6 million increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in our operating income and non-operating income, net, as well as a decrease in our income tax provision, all as previously discussed. Our operating results during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 were negatively impacted by net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits) totaling $69.9 million and $66.0 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $52.6 million and $52.9 million, respectively. Net income during Fiscal 2024 also reflected an income tax benefit of $13.1 million recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, as previously discussed.\nNet Income per Diluted Share.\n    Net income per diluted share increased to $9.71 in Fiscal 2024, from $7.58 in Fiscal 2023. The $2.13 per share increase was primarily driven by the higher level of net income, as previously discussed, and lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during Fiscal 2024 driven by our share repurchases during the preceding twelve months. Net income per diluted share for Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 were also negatively impacted by $0.80 per share and $0.76 per share, respectively, attributable to net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (benefits), as previously discussed. Net income per diluted share during Fiscal 2024 was also favorably impacted by $0.20 due to an income tax benefit recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform and the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, as previously discussed.\n60\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nFinancial Condition\n \nThe following table presents our financial condition as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024.\nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\n$\nChange\n \n(millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,922.5 \n$\n1,662.2 \n$\n260.3 \nShort-term investments\n160.5 \n121.0 \n39.5 \nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n(a)\n \n(399.7)\n— \n(399.7)\nLong-term debt\n(a)\n \n(742.9)\n(1,140.5)\n397.6 \nNet cash and short-term investments\n$\n940.4 \n$\n642.7 \n$\n297.7 \nEquity\n$\n2,588.5 \n$\n2,450.3 \n$\n138.2 \n(a)\nSee Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the carrying values of our debt.\nThe increase in our net cash and short-term investments position at March 29, 2025 as compared to March 30, 2024 was primarily due to our operating cash flows of $1.235 billion, partially offset by our use of cash to support Class A common stock repurchases of $480.9 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through $216.2 million in capital expenditures, and to make dividend payments of $201.1 million.\nThe increase in our equity was attributable to our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements, partially offset by our share repurchase activity and dividends declared during Fiscal 2025.\nCash Flows\nFiscal 2025 Compared to Fiscal 2024\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \n \nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\n$\nChange\n \n(millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,235.1 \n$\n1,069.7 \n$\n165.4 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(264.1)\n(256.8)\n(7.3)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(704.0)\n(665.6)\n(38.4)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n(8.2)\n(13.6)\n5.4 \nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n258.8 \n$\n133.7 \n$\n125.1 \nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities.\n    Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.235 billion during Fiscal 2025, as compared to $1.070 billion during Fiscal 2024. The $165.4 million net increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to an increase in net income before non-cash charges, as well as a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nThe net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:\n•\na favorable change in our accounts payable driven by the timing of cash payments, as well as a net favorable change in accrued liabilities largely driven by accrued payroll and benefits resulting from anticipated higher bonus achievement levels, partially offset by our restructuring reserve due to a decrease in restructuring charges recorded during the current fiscal year period as compared to the prior fiscal year period.\n61\nThis increase related to our operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by:\n•\nan unfavorable change in inventory driven by higher in-transit inventory, as well as higher product and freight costs.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities.    \nNet cash used in investing activities was $264.1 million during Fiscal 2025, as compared to $256.8 million during Fiscal 2024. The $7.3 million net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by:\n•\na $51.4 million increase in capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2025, we spent $216.2 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $164.8 million during Fiscal 2024. Our capital expenditures during Fiscal 2025 primarily related to store openings and renovations, enhancements to our information technology systems, and corporate office renovations.\nThis increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by:\n•\na $41.0 million decrease in purchases of investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. During Fiscal 2025, we made net investment purchases of $47.5 million, as compared to $88.5 million during Fiscal 2024.\nIn Fiscal 2026, we expect to spend approximately 4% to 5% of net revenues on capital expenditures, primarily related to the purchase of real estate, store openings and renovations, enhancements to our information technology systems (including those related to our Next Generation Transformation project), and a continuation of our corporate office renovations.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities.\n    Net cash used in financing activities was $704.0 million during Fiscal 2025, as compared to $665.6 million during Fiscal 2024. The $38.4 million net increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:\n•\na $31.2 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During Fiscal 2025, we used $424.5 million to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $56.4 million in shares of our Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2024, we used $398.2 million to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $51.5 million in shares of our Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes.\nFiscal 2024 Compared to Fiscal 2023\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \n \nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\n$\nChange\n \n(millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,069.7 \n$\n411.0 \n$\n658.7 \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n(256.8)\n471.5 \n(728.3)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(665.6)\n(1,208.8)\n543.2 \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n(13.6)\n(8.8)\n(4.8)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n133.7 \n$\n(335.1)\n$\n468.8 \nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities.\n    Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.070 billion during Fiscal 2024, as compared to $411.0 million during Fiscal 2023. The $658.7 million net increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as an increase in net income before non-cash charges.\n62\nThe net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:\n•\na favorable change related to our inventories, largely driven by a more normalized receipt cadence;\n•\na net favorable change in our accrued liabilities largely driven by the impact of a lower bonus achievement level realized during Fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior fiscal year and a favorable change in our restructuring reserve due to an increase in restructuring charges recorded during Fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as a favorable change in accounts payable driven by the timing of cash payments; and\n•\na favorable change related to our accounts receivable, largely driven by a decline in wholesale net revenues and timing of cash receipts.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities.    \nNet cash used in investing activities was $256.8 million during Fiscal 2024, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $471.5 million during Fiscal 2023. The $728.3 million net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by:\n•\na $783.3 million decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, less purchases of investments. During Fiscal 2024, we made net investment purchases of $88.5 million, as compared to receiving net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $694.8 million during Fiscal 2023.\nThis increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by:\n•\na $52.7 million decrease in capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2024, we spent $164.8 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $217.5 million during Fiscal 2023. Our capital expenditures during Fiscal 2024 primarily related to store openings and renovations, as well as enhancements to our information technology systems.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities.\n    Net cash used in financing activities was $665.6 million during Fiscal 2024, as compared to $1.209 billion during Fiscal 2023. The $543.2 million net decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:\n•\na $500.0 million decrease in cash used to repay debt. During Fiscal 2024, we did not issue or repay any debt. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2023, we repaid our previously outstanding $500.0 million principal amount of unsecured 1.700% senior notes that matured on June 15, 2022; and\n•\na $38.9 million decrease in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During Fiscal 2024, we used $398.2 million to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $51.5 million in shares of our Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2023, we used $454.3 million to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $34.3 million in shares of our Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, availability under our credit and overdraft facilities and commercial paper program, and other available financing options. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity and/or funds to refinance existing debt.\nDuring Fiscal 2025, we generated $1.235 billion of net cash flows from our operations. As of March 29, 2025, we had $2.083 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, of which $1.398 billion were held by our subsidiaries domiciled outside the U.S. We are not dependent on foreign cash to fund our domestic operations. Undistributed foreign earnings generated on or before December 31, 2017 that were subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax in connection with U.S. tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") are not considered to be permanently reinvested and may be repatriated to the U.S. in the future with minimal or no additional U.S. taxation. We intend to permanently reinvest undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time \n63\nmandatory transition tax. However, if our plans change and we choose to repatriate post-2017 earnings to the U.S. in the future, we would be subject to applicable U.S. and foreign taxes.\nThe following table presents the total availability, borrowings outstanding, and remaining availability under our credit and overdraft facilities and Commercial Paper Program as of March 29, 2025:\n \nMarch 29, 2025\nDescription\n(a)\nTotal\nAvailability\nBorrowings\nOutstanding\nRemaining\nAvailability\n \n(millions)\nGlobal Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program\n(b)\n \n$\n750 \n$\n11 \n(c)\n$\n739 \nPan-Asia Credit Facilities\n33 \n— \n33 \nJapan Overdraft Facility\n33 \n— \n33 \n(a)\nAs defined in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n(b)\nBorrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility. Accordingly, we do not expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Global Credit Facility to exceed $750 million.\n(c)\nRepresents outstanding letters of credit for which we were contingently liable under the Global Credit Facility as of March 29, 2025.\nWe believe that the Global Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentration in any one financial institution. In particular, as of March 29, 2025, there were seven financial institutions participating in the Global Credit Facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 20%. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we have the ability to expand our borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1.500 billion through the full term of the facility, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments.\nBorrowings under the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities and Japan Overdraft Facility (collectively, the \"Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities\") are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the participating banks (as described within Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), subject to availability of the respective banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. We have no reason to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the Global Credit Facility and the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities in the event of our election to draw additional funds in the foreseeable future.\nOur sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store and digital commerce expansion, construction and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in infrastructure, including technology, payment of dividends, debt repayments, Class A common stock repurchases, settlement of contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions), and other corporate activities, including our restructuring actions. We believe that our existing sources of cash, the availability under our credit facilities, and our ability to access capital markets will be sufficient to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, the ongoing development of our businesses, and our plans for further business expansion. However, prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions in any of our key regions, or a combination thereof, such as those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, could impede our ability to pay our obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our operations.\nSee Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our credit facilities.\nSupplier Finance Program\nWe support a voluntary supplier finance program which provides certain of our inventory suppliers the opportunity, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables due from us (which are generally due within 90 days) to a participating financial institution in exchange for receipt of a discounted payment amount made earlier than the payment term stipulated between us and the supplier. Our vendor payment terms and amounts due are not impacted by a supplier's decision to participate in the program. We have not pledged any assets and do not provide guarantees under the supplier finance program. Our payment \n64\nobligations outstanding under our supplier finance program were $181.0 million and $129.2 million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively, and were recorded within accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our supplier finance program. \nDebt and Covenant Compliance\nIn August 2018, we completed a registered public debt offering and issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due September 15, 2025, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.750%, payable semi-annually (the \"3.750% Senior Notes\"). In June 2020, we completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes that were due and repaid on June 15, 2022 with cash on hand, which bore interest at a fixed rate of 1.700%, payable semi-annually (the \"1.700% Senior Notes\"), and $750 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2030, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.950%, payable semi-annually (the \"2.950% Senior Notes\").\nThe indenture and supplemental indentures governing the 3.750% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes (as supplemented, the \"Indenture\") contain certain covenants that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of our property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any financial covenants.\nWe have a credit facility that provides for a $750 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit through June 30, 2028, which may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures, certain investments, general corporate purposes, and for funding of acquisitions, as well as used to support the issuance of letters of credit and the maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program (the \"Global Credit Facility\"). Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and certain other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen. We have the ability to expand the borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1.500 billion, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.\nThe Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of March 29, 2025, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under our Global Credit Facility. The Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities do not contain any financial covenants.\nSee Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our debt and covenant compliance.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nAs of March 29, 2025, the remaining availability under our Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately $352 million. On May 15, 2025, our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our existing common stock repurchase program that allows us to repurchase up to an additional $1.500 billion of our Class A common stock, excluding related excise taxes. Repurchases of shares of our Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions.\nSee Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our Class A common stock repurchase program.\nDividends\nWe have generally maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on our common stock since 2003. \nOn May 16, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.75 to $0.825 per share. On May 15, 2025, our Board of Directors approved an additional increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.825 to $0.9125 per share. The first quarterly dividend to reflect this increase is expected to be payable to shareholders of record at close of business on June 27, 2025 and paid on July 11, 2025.\nWe intend to continue to pay regular dividends on outstanding shares of our common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will ultimately be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions.\n65\nSee Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our quarterly cash dividend program.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nFirm Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain of our aggregate material cash requirements as of March 29, 2025, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. We expect to fund these firm commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, through availability under our credit facilities or other accessible sources of financing.\nFiscal\n2026\nFiscal\n2027-2028\nFiscal\n2029-2030\nFiscal\n2031 and\nThereafter\nTotal\n \n(millions)\nSenior Notes\n$\n400.0 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n750.0 \n$\n1,150.0 \nInterest payments on debt\n29.6 \n44.3 \n44.3 \n11.1 \n129.3 \nOperating leases\n265.4 \n429.7 \n280.6 \n517.4 \n1,493.1 \nFinance leases\n28.2 \n58.8 \n44.4 \n166.8 \n298.2 \nOther lease commitments\n6.3 \n26.4 \n26.3 \n31.0 \n90.0 \nInventory purchase commitments\n937.8 \n— \n— \n— \n937.8 \nMandatory transition tax payments\n42.2 \n— \n— \n— \n42.2 \nReal estate purchase commitment\n116.9 \n— \n— \n— \n116.9 \nOther commitments\n110.9 \n122.1 \n71.8 \n— \n304.8 \nTotal\n$\n1,937.3 \n$\n681.3 \n$\n467.4 \n$\n1,476.3 \n$\n4,562.3 \nThe following is a description of our material, firmly committed obligations as of March 29, 2025:\n•\nSenior Notes\n represent the principal amount of our outstanding 3.750% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes. Amounts do not include any call premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs, or interest payments (see below);\n•\nInterest payments on debt\n represent the semi-annual contractual interest payments due on our 3.750% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes. Amounts do not include the impact of potential cash flows underlying our related swap contracts (see Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our swap contracts);\n•\nLease obligations\n represent fixed payments due over the lease term of our noncancelable leases of real estate and operating equipment, including rent, real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees, and/or certain other costs. For lease terms that have commenced, information has been presented separately for operating and finance leases. Other lease commitments relate to executed lease agreements for which the related lease terms have not yet commenced as of March 29, 2025;\n•\nInventory purchase commitments\n represent our legally-binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices;\n•\nMandatory transition tax payments\n represent our remaining tax obligation incurred in connection with the deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings pursuant to the TCJA (see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the TCJA);\n•\nReal estate purchase commitment \nrelates to our legally-binding agreement to purchase real estate located in New York City; and\n•\nOther commitments\n primarily represent our legally-binding obligations related to sponsorship, licensing, and other marketing and advertising agreements; information technology-related service agreements; and pension-related obligations.\n66\nExcluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $193.3 million as of March 29, 2025, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts recorded in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of March 29, 2025, which will be paid within one year, other than lease obligations, mandatory transition tax payments, and accrued interest payments on debt; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred income), or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a \"purchase obligation\" as such term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes, derivative financial instruments, asset retirement obligations, and other miscellaneous items).\nWe also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments if certain events or circumstances occur. See Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn addition to the commitments included in the above table, our other off-balance sheet firm commitments relating to our outstanding letters of credit amounted to $10.6 million as of March 29, 2025. We do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nAs discussed in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we are exposed to a variety of levels and types of risks, including the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated balances, certain anticipated cash flows of our international operations, and the value of reported net assets of our foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations relating to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, in the normal course of business we assess such risks and, in accordance with our established policies and procedures, may use derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate them. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.\nGiven our use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, it is our policy to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. Our established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. As a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to undue concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our derivative contracts as of March 29, 2025. However, we do have in aggregate $25.9 million of derivative instruments in net asset positions held across three creditworthy financial institutions.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nWe manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates using forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. Refer to Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the notional amounts and fair values of our outstanding forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts, as well as the impact on earnings and other comprehensive income of such instruments for the fiscal years presented.\nForward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts\nWe use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into U.S. Dollars. As part of our overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, we generally hedge a portion of our related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of two months to one year to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.\nOur foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by established policies and procedures. These policies and procedures provide a framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within our established guidelines. Our policies include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management activities, including, but not limited to, \n67\nauthorization levels, transaction limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor foreign exchange risk using different techniques, including periodic review of market values and performance of sensitivity analyses.\nCross-Currency Swap Contracts\nWe periodically designate pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts as hedges of our net investment in certain European subsidiaries. These contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments based on the contract's notional amount and the fixed rate of interest payable on certain of our senior notes for Euro-denominated fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically converting a portion of our fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to fixed rate Euro-denominated obligations.\nSee Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our foreign currency exposures and the types of derivative instruments used to hedge those exposures.\nSensitivity\nWe perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. In doing so, we assess the risk of loss in the fair values of these contracts that would result from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. Dollar. As of March 29, 2025, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies under contract would result in a net increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $121 million. This hypothetical net change in fair value should ultimately be largely offset by the net change in the related underlying hedged items.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nSensitivity\nAs of March 29, 2025, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding. As such, our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to changes in the fair values of our fixed-rate Senior Notes. As of March 29, 2025, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes were $1.089 billion. A 25-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase, respectively, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes by approximately $9 million based on certain simplifying assumptions, including an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. Such potential increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt would only be realized if we were to retire all or a portion of the debt prior to its maturity.\nInvestment Risk Management\nAs of March 29, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents on-hand of $1.922 billion, consisting of deposits in interest bearing accounts, investments in money market deposit accounts, and investments in time deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less. Our other significant investments included $160.5 million of short-term investments, consisting of time deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days.\nWe actively monitor our exposure to changes in the fair value of our global investment portfolio in accordance with our established policies and procedures, which include monitoring both general and issuer-specific economic conditions, as discussed in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy. See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail of the composition of our investment portfolio as of March 29, 2025.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. We believe that the \n68\nfollowing list represents our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nSales Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts\nA significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue involves estimating sales reserves, which represent the portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In particular, gross revenue related to our wholesale business is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances. Gross revenue related to our retail business, including digital commerce sales, is also reduced by an estimate of returns.\nIn developing estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and cooperative advertising allowances, we analyze historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. We review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis. Our historical estimates of these amounts have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from widespread pandemic diseases and/or other catastrophic events, could result in our actual results differing materially from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances as of March 29, 2025 would have reduced our Fiscal 2025 net revenues by approximately $1 million.\nSimilarly, we evaluate our accounts receivable balances to develop expectations regarding the extent to which they will ultimately be collected. Significant judgment and estimation are involved in this evaluation, including a receivables aging analysis which shows, by aged category, the percentage of receivables that has historically gone uncollected, an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts (including consideration of their financial condition and ability to withstand potential prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions), and an evaluation of current and forecasted economic and market conditions over the respective asset's contractual life. Based on this information, we record an allowance for estimated amounts that we ultimately expect not to collect due to credit. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for these risks as part of our allowance for doubtful accounts, a severe and prolonged adverse impact on our major customers' business and operations beyond those forecasted could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net revenues, cash flows, and/or financial condition. A hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 29, 2025 would have increased our Fiscal 2025 SG&A expenses by less than $1 million.\nSee \"Accounts Receivable\" in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented.\nInventories\nWe hold retail inventory that is sold in our own stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. We also hold inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores. Substantially all of our inventories are comprised of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis.\nThe estimated net realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions (including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events), and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through our outlet stores, among other liquidation channels. Actual results may differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and economic and market conditions. Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. Our historical estimates of these costs and the related provisions have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions could result in our actual results differing materially from our estimates. \nA hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our inventory reserves as of March 29, 2025 would have decreased our Fiscal 2025 gross profit by approximately $3 million.\n69\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable.\nWe generally perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. However, in order to reassess the fair values of our reporting units, we periodically perform a quantitative impairment analysis in lieu of using the qualitative approach.\nPerformance of the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair values of our reporting units. This requires consideration and assessment of external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and planned financial performance. We also give consideration to the difference between each reporting unit's fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date that a fair value measurement was performed. If the results of the qualitative assessment conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed.\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired. However, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Any impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of the respective reporting unit's allocated goodwill.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit under the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including an assessment of external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used when determining the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining any potential goodwill impairment, we may review and consider appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons, and recent transactions. These approaches involve significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in those future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and selection of appropriate market comparable metrics and transactions.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2025 using the qualitative approach discussed above. In performing the assessment, we considered the results of our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, the results of which indicated that the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. Based on the results of the qualitative impairment assessment, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIn evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition where probable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external market participant assumptions.\nIt is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) our businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions, (iii) business conditions or strategies change from our current assumptions, or (iv) the identification of our reporting units change, among other factors. Such changes could result in a future impairment charge of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n70\nImpairment of Other Long-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment and lease-related right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (including any potential sublease income for lease-related ROU assets) and its eventual disposition, where applicable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external market participant assumptions and discounted cash flows, including those based on estimated market rents for lease-related ROU assets. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal (commonly referred to as assets held-for-sale) are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.\nIn determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations. For example, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions could negatively impact consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences and result in actual results differing from our estimates. Additionally, we may review and consider appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, where applicable.\nDuring Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2023, we recorded impairment charges of $0.8 million and $9.7 million, respectively, to write-down the carrying values of certain long-lived assets based upon their assumed fair values. No impairment charges were recorded during Fiscal 2024. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nIn determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If we believe that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. We measure the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. To the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment of a position fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we will recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit carryforwards, and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, which typically involves the use of significant estimates. Such allowances are adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances.\nSee Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.\nContingencies\nWe are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including potential losses relating to certain litigation, alleged information system security breaches, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable. In addition, if it is considered reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed any established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if practicable. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and governmental actions. As a \n71\nresult, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management's judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe expense all stock-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and expected future trends.\nRestricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\")\nWe grant service-based RSUs to certain of our senior executives and other employees, as well as to our non-employee directors. In addition, we grant RSUs with performance-based and market-based vesting conditions to such senior executives and other key employees.\nThe fair values of our service-based RSU and performance-based RSU awards are measured based on the fair value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. Related compensation expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the employees' requisite service period, to the extent that our attainment of performance goals (upon which vesting is dependent) is deemed probable, and involves judgment as to expectations surrounding our achievement of certain defined operating performance metrics.\nThe fair value of our market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return (\"TSR\") of our Class A common stock over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is measured on the grant date based on estimated projections of our relative TSR over the performance period. These estimates are made using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths of our Class A common stock and that of the peer group to evaluate and determine our ultimate expected relative TSR performance ranking. Related compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. See Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nSensitivity\nThe assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair values of our stock-based compensation awards represent our best estimates. In addition, projecting the achievement level of certain performance-based awards, as well as estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited, requires judgment. If actual results or forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, or if assumptions used to estimate the grant date fair value of future stock-based award grants are significantly changed, stock-based compensation expense and, therefore, our results of operations could be materially impacted. A hypothetical 10% change in our Fiscal 2025 stock-based compensation expense would have affected our net income by approximately $9 million.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued accounting standards which have impacted our consolidated financial statements, or may impact our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nItem 7A.\n    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nFor a discussion of our exposure to market risk, see \"Market Risk Management\" in Item 7 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nItem 8.\n    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nSee the \"Index to Consolidated Financial Statements\" appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 9.\n    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNot applicable.\n72\nItem 9A.\n    Controls and Procedures.\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nWe have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level, as of the fiscal year-end covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company's assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a specific date, and continued effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal controls over financial reporting were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the fiscal year-end covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nErnst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as included elsewhere herein.\n(c) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \nItem 9B.\n    Other Information.\nTrading Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended March 29, 2025, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act) \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n \"Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements\" or \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements\" (each term as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act).\n73\nItem 9C.\n    Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNot applicable.\nPART III\nItem 10.\n    Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\nInformation relating to our directors and corporate governance will be set forth in the Company's proxy statement for its 2025 annual meeting of stockholders to be filed within 120 days after March 29, 2025 (the \"Proxy Statement\") and is incorporated by reference herein.

RLC's long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands, distribution channels, and international markets. RLC's brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Double RL, Polo Ralph Lauren, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, and Chaps, among others. RLC and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" and \"ourselves,\" unless the context indicates otherwise.\nThe Company diversifies its business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows the Company to maintain a dynamic balance as its operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. The Company sells directly to consumers through its integrated retail channel, which includes its retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. The Company's wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which the Company has licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using its trademarks. In addition, the Company licenses to third parties for specified periods the right to access its various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel categories, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.\nThe Company organizes its business into the following \nthree\n reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company also has other non-reportable segments. See Note 20 for further discussion of the Company's segment reporting structure.\n2.    \nBasis of Presentation\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\") and present the consolidated financial position, income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows of the Company, including all entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest and is determined to be the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n \nFiscal Year\nThe Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As such, fiscal year 2025 ended on March 29, 2025 and was a 52-week period (\"Fiscal 2025\"); fiscal year 2024 ended on March 30, 2024 and was a 52-week period (\"Fiscal 2024\"); fiscal year 2023 ended on April 1, 2023 and was a 52-week period (\"Fiscal 2023\"); and fiscal year 2026 will end on March 28, 2026 and will be a 52-week period (\"Fiscal 2026\").\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include reserves for customer bad debt, customer returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances; the realizability of inventory; reserves for litigation and other contingencies; useful lives and impairments of long-lived tangible and intangible assets; fair value measurements; accounting for income taxes and related uncertain tax positions; valuation of stock-based compensation awards and related forfeiture rates; and reserves for restructuring activity, among others.\nF-7\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods' financial information in order to conform to the current period's presentation\n.\n3.    \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue across all channels of the business when it satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to its customers, which occurs either at a point in time or over time, depending on when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services. The amount of revenue recognized considers terms of sale that create variability in the amount of consideration that the Company ultimately expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services, and is subject to an overall constraint that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Sales and other related taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue.\nRevenue from the Company's retail business is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of the products, which occurs either at the point of sale for merchandise purchased at the Company's own retail stores and shop-within-shop locations, or upon receipt of shipment for merchandise ordered through direct-to-consumer digital commerce sites. Such revenues are recorded net of estimated returns based on historical trends. Payment is due at the point of sale. \nGift cards purchased by customers are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed for products sold by the Company's retail business, at which point revenue is recognized. The Company also estimates and recognizes revenue for gift card balances not expected to ever be redeemed (referred to as \"breakage\") to the extent that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. Such estimates are based upon historical redemption trends, with breakage income recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual customer redemptions.\nRevenue from the Company's wholesale business is generally recognized upon shipment of products, at which point title passes and risk of loss is transferred to the customer. In certain arrangements where the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment, revenue is recognized upon receipt of products by the customer. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances. Returns and allowances require pre-approval from management and discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates for end-of-season markdown reserves are based on historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on at least a quarterly basis. The Company's historical estimates of these amounts have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue from the Company's licensing arrangements is recognized over time during the period that licensees are provided access to the Company's trademarks (i.e., symbolic intellectual property) and benefit from such access through their own sales of licensed products. These arrangements require licensees to pay a sales-based royalty, which for most arrangements, may be subject to a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Payments are generally due quarterly and, depending on time of receipt, may be recorded as a liability until recognized as revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for sales-based royalty arrangements (including those for which the royalty exceeds any contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount) as licensed products are sold by the licensee. If a sales-based royalty is not ultimately expected to exceed a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount, the minimum is generally recognized as revenue ratably over the respective contractual period. This sales-based output measure of progress and pattern of recognition best represents the value transferred to the licensee over the term of the arrangement, as well as the amount of consideration that the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for providing access to its trademarks.\n \nF-8\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAs of March 29, 2025, contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amounts expected to be recognized as revenue during future periods were as follows:\nContractually-Guaranteed\nMinimum Royalties\n(a)\n(millions)\nFiscal 2026\n$\n94.6\n \nFiscal 2027\n92.9\n \nFiscal 2028\n58.5\n \nFiscal 2029\n34.6\n \nFiscal 2030 and thereafter\n24.0\n \nTotal\n$\n304.6\n \n(a)\nAmounts presented do not contemplate potential contract renewals or royalties earned in excess of the contractually-guaranteed minimums.\nDisaggregated Net Revenues\nThe following tables disaggregate the Company's net revenues into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors for the fiscal years presented:\nFiscal Year Ended\nMarch 29, 2025\nNorth America\nEurope\nAsia\nOther\nTotal\n(millions)\nSales Channel\n(a)\n:\nRetail\n$\n2,034.4\n \n$\n1,104.1\n \n$\n1,631.6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4,770.1\n \nWholesale\n1,015.7\n \n1,070.8\n \n77.8\n \n—\n \n2,164.3\n \nLicensing\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n144.6\n \n144.6\n \nTotal\n$\n3,050.1\n \n$\n2,174.9\n \n$\n1,709.4\n \n$\n144.6\n \n$\n7,079.0\n \nFiscal Year Ended\nMarch 30, 2024\nNorth America\nEurope\nAsia\nOther\nTotal\n(millions)\nSales Channel\n(a)\n:\nRetail\n$\n1,915.9\n \n$\n971.3\n \n$\n1,463.8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4,351.0\n \nWholesale\n1,034.6\n \n996.7\n \n102.8\n \n—\n \n2,134.1\n \nLicensing\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n146.3\n \n146.3\n \nTotal\n$\n2,950.5\n \n$\n1,968.0\n \n$\n1,566.6\n \n$\n146.3\n \n$\n6,631.4\n \nFiscal Year Ended\nApril 1, 2023\nNorth America\nEurope\nAsia\nOther\nTotal\n(millions)\nSales Channel\n(a)\n:\nRetail\n$\n1,872.6\n \n$\n858.4\n \n$\n1,322.1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4,053.1\n \nWholesale\n1,147.9\n \n980.8\n \n104.6\n \n—\n \n2,233.3\n \nLicensing\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n157.2\n \n157.2\n \nTotal\n$\n3,020.5\n \n$\n1,839.2\n \n$\n1,426.7\n \n$\n157.2\n \n$\n6,443.6\n \nF-9\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(a)\nNet revenues from the Company's retail and wholesale businesses are recognized at a point in time. Net revenues from the Company's licensing business are recognized over time.\nDeferred Income\nDeferred income represents cash payments received in advance of the Company's transfer of control of products or services to its customers and generally consists of unredeemed gift cards (net of breakage) and advance royalty payments from its licensees.\n The Company's deferred income balances were $\n16.7\n million and $\n17.4\n million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively, and were primarily recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. The majority of the deferred income balance as of March 29, 2025 is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months.\nCost of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses\nCost of goods sold includes the amounts incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale to the Company's customers, including product costs, freight-in, and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. Gains and losses associated with forward foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of inventory transactions are also recognized within cost of goods sold when the hedged inventory is sold. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing, and order charges (\"handling costs\"), are included in selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nCosts associated with shipping goods to customers are accounted for as fulfillment activities and reflected as SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs (described above) billed to customers are included in revenue.\n \nA summary of shipping and handling costs recognized during the fiscal years presented is as follows:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\n \n(millions)\nShipping costs\n$\n92.2\n \n$\n81.7\n \n$\n79.9\n \nHandling costs\n167.9\n \n171.2\n \n169.7\n \nMarketing and Advertising Costs\nAdvertising costs, including the costs to produce advertising, are expensed when the advertisement is first exhibited. Advertising costs paid to wholesale customers under cooperative advertising programs are not included in advertising costs, but rather are reflected as a reduction of revenue since generally the benefits are not sufficiently separable from the purchases of the Company's products by customers. Costs associated with the marketing and promotion of the Company's products are included within SG&A expenses.\nMarketing and advertising expenses were $\n516.3\n million, $\n467.0\n million, and $\n438.1\n million in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively. Deferred marketing and advertising costs, which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet been exhibited or payments made for services that have not yet been received, were $\n21.7\n million and $\n19.6\n million at the end of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively, and were recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe financial position and operating results of the Company's foreign operations are accounted for in their respective functional currencies, which are generally consistent with the local currency. For purposes of consolidation, local currency assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. Dollars at the spot rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. Dollars at average rates of exchange in effect during the period. The \nF-10\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nresulting translation gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) (\"OCI\") and in the consolidated statements of equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\"). Gains and losses on the translation of intercompany loans made to foreign subsidiaries that are of a long-term investment nature are also included within this component of equity.\nThe Company also recognizes gains and losses on both third-party and intercompany balances that are denominated in a currency other than the respective entity's functional currency. Such foreign currency transactional gains and losses are recognized within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, inclusive of the effects of any related hedging activities, and reflected net losses of $\n5.6\n million, $\n3.1\n million, and $\n4.5\n million in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and  Fiscal 2023, respectively.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income, which is reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of equity, consists of net income and certain other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net income and referred to as OCI. Components of OCI consist of foreign currency translation gains (losses); net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts; net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments; and net realized and unrealized gains (losses) related to the Company's defined benefit plans.\nNet Income per Common Share \nBasic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Weighted-average common shares include shares of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock. Diluted net income per common share adjusts basic net income per common share for the dilutive effects of outstanding restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and any other potentially dilutive instruments and stock-based compensation awards using the treasury stock method, only for periods in which such effects are dilutive.\nThe weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic net income per common share is reconciled to shares used to calculate diluted net income per common share as follows:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\n \n(millions)\nBasic shares\n62.6\n \n65.2\n \n67.7\n \nDilutive effect of RSUs\n1.4\n \n1.3\n \n1.3\n \nDiluted shares\n64.0\n \n66.5\n \n69.0\n \nAll earnings per share amounts have been calculated using unrounded numbers. \nThe Company has outstanding performance-based RSUs, which are included in the computation of diluted shares only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions (i) have been satisfied as of the end of the reporting period or (ii) would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the result would be dilutive.\n As of the end of Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, there were \n0.2\n million, \n0.3\n million, and \n0.3\n million, respectively, of additional shares issuable contingent upon vesting of performance-based RSUs that were excluded from the diluted shares calculations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and expected future trends. The grant date fair values of service-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs are determined based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. The grant date fair value of the Company's market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return (\"TSR\") of its Class A common stock over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\nF-11\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nCompensation expense for all performance-based RSUs is recognized over the requisite service period when attainment of the performance goal is deemed probable, net of estimated forfeitures. Compensation expense for market-based RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite service period regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. The Company recognizes compensation expense on an accelerated basis for all awards with graded vesting terms, including certain RSUs. For RSU awards with cliff vesting terms, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis. For certain RSU awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who will become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, the related compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over a term commensurate with the period that the employee is required to provide service in order to vest in the award. See Note 18 for further discussion of the Company's stock-based compensation plans.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less, including investments in time deposits and debt securities. Investments in debt securities are diversified across high-credit quality issuers in accordance with the Company's risk-management policies.\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company is periodically required to place cash in escrow with various banks as collateral, primarily to secure guarantees of corresponding amounts made by the banks to international tax authorities on behalf of the Company, such as to secure refunds of value-added tax payments in certain international tax jurisdictions or in the case of certain international tax audits, as well as to secure guarantees related to certain real estate leases. Such cash is classified as restricted cash and reported as a component of either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nInvestments\nThe Company's investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in the Company's investment policy.\nShort-term investments consist of investments which the Company expects to convert into cash within one year, including any time deposits and debt securities with original maturities greater than 90 days. See Note 13 for further information relating to the composition of the Company's short-term investments.\nThe Company classifies such investments as available-for-sale. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair value with any related unrealized gains or losses generally recognized as a component of AOCI in the consolidated balance sheets, and related realized gains or losses (or unrealized credit-related impairment losses, if any) recorded within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. Cash inflows and outflows related to the sale and purchase of investments are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nEquity-method and Other Investments\nOwnership interests that provide the Company with significant influence, but less than a controlling interest, over an investee are generally accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of the investee's common stock. Ownership interests that do not provide significant influence and for which the underlying equity security's fair value is not readily determinable are generally recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same investee, with such adjustments recognized within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUnder the equity method of accounting, the following amounts are generally recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements: the Company's original investment, as subsequently adjusted for its share of the investee's earnings (losses) and reduced by any dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments recorded, is included in the consolidated balance sheets; the Company's share of the investee's periodic earnings (losses) is included in the consolidated statements of operations; and dividends and other cash distributions received from the investee and additional cash investments made in or other cash paid to the investee are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \nThe Company's share of equity-\nF-12\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nmethod investee earnings and losses is recognized within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations and was not material in any of the fiscal years presented.\nThese investments are recorded within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nImpairment Assessment\nThe Company evaluates the need to recognize impairment charges for its investments that are in unrealized loss positions, if any, and its other equity investments on a quarterly basis (see Note 12). Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers or investees. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the financial condition, creditworthiness, and near-term prospects of the issuer or investee; (ii) future economic conditions and market forecasts; (iii) the length of time to maturity, if applicable, and an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of market value; and (iv) whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the investment's carrying amount might not be recoverable.\nAccounts Receivable\nIn the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to wholesale customers that satisfy certain defined credit criteria. Payment is generally due within \n30 to 120 days\n and does not involve a significant financing component. Accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and are presented in the consolidated balance sheets net of certain reserves and allowances. These reserves and allowances consist of (i) reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances (see the \"\nRevenue Recognition\n\" section above for further discussion of related accounting policies) and (ii) allowances for doubtful accounts.\nA rollforward of the activity in the Company's reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances is presented as follows:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\n \n(millions)\nBeginning reserve balance\n$\n143.1\n \n$\n148.1\n \n$\n180.7\n \nAmount charged against revenue to increase reserve\n454.3\n \n450.7\n \n407.9\n \nAmount credited against customer accounts to decrease reserve\n(\n449.9\n)\n(\n453.7\n)\n(\n436.5\n)\nForeign currency translation\n0.1\n \n(\n2.0\n)\n(\n4.0\n)\nEnding reserve balance\n$\n147.6\n \n$\n143.1\n \n$\n148.1\n \nAn allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of accounts receivable aging, assessments of collectability based on evaluation of historical trends, the financial condition of the Company's customers and their ability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, and evaluation of the impact of current and forecasted economic and market conditions over the related asset's contractual life, among other factors.\nA rollforward of the activity in the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is presented as follows:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\n \n(millions)\nBeginning reserve balance\n$\n32.2\n \n$\n27.2\n \n$\n34.0\n \nAmount recorded to expense to increase reserve\n(a)\n \n9.2\n \n7.3\n \n2.3\n \nAmount written-off against customer accounts to decrease reserve\n(\n2.7\n)\n(\n2.0\n)\n(\n8.5\n)\nForeign currency translation\n—\n \n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n0.6\n)\nEnding reserve balance\n$\n38.7\n \n$\n32.2\n \n$\n27.2\n \nF-13\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(a)\nAmounts recorded to bad debt expense are included within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company sells its wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, and extends credit based on an evaluation of each customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. In the Company's wholesale business, concentration of credit risk is relatively limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. However, the Company has \nthree\n key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During Fiscal 2025, the Company's sales to these \nthree\n customers accounted for approximately \n12\n% of total net revenues. Approximately 70% of sales to the Company's \nthree\n largest wholesale customers related to its North America segment and approximately 30% related to its Europe segment. As of March 29, 2025, these \nthree\n wholesale customers accounted for approximately \n25\n% of total gross accounts receivable.\nInventories\nThe Company holds inventory that is sold in its retail stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. The Company also holds inventory that is to be sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners. Substantially all of the Company's inventories consist of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis.\nThe estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the Company's individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions (such as those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events), and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current in-house orders for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through the Company's outlet stores, among other liquidation channels. Actual results may differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and actual economic and market conditions. In addition, reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. The Company's historical estimates of the realizable value of its inventory and its reserves for inventory shrinkage have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions could result in the Company's actual results differing materially from its estimates.\n \nSupplier Finance Program\nThe Company supports a voluntary supplier finance program which provides certain of its inventory suppliers the opportunity, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables due from the Company (which are generally due within 90 days) to a participating financial institution in exchange for receipt of a discounted payment amount made earlier than the payment term stipulated between the Company and the supplier. The Company's vendor payment terms and amounts due are not impacted by a supplier's decision to participate in the program. The Company has not pledged any assets and does not provide guarantees under the supplier finance program.\n The Company's payment obligations outstanding under its supplier finance program were $\n181.0\n million and $\n129.2\n million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively, which were recorded within \naccounts payable\n in the consolidated balance sheets. \nA rollforward of obligations confirmed as valid under the Company's supplier finance program is presented as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nMarch 29,\n2025\n(millions)\nBeginning obligations outstanding\n$\n129.2\n \nInvoices confirmed during the year\n935.3\n \nConfirmed invoices paid during the year\n(\n883.5\n)\nEnding obligations outstanding\n$\n181.0\n \nF-14\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nImplementation Costs Incurred in Cloud Computing Arrangements\nFor cloud computing arrangements that are a service contract, the Company capitalizes certain implementation costs incurred (depending on their nature) during the application development stage of the related project, and expenses costs during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages as they are incurred. Capitalized implementation costs are expensed on a straight-line basis over the reasonably certain term of the hosting arrangement, beginning when the module is ready for its intended use. The Company's cloud computing arrangements relate to various areas, including certain retail store and digital commerce operations, and corporate and administrative functions. Capitalized amounts related to such arrangements are recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets and within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 7).\n Capitalized implementation costs expensed were $\n10.2\n million, $\n9.1\n million, and $\n6.3\n million during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively, and were recorded in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis, based upon the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets, which range from \n3\n to \n7\n years for furniture and fixtures, machinery and equipment, and capitalized software; and from \n10\n to \n40\n years for buildings and improvements. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the term of the related lease.\nProperty and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see Note 12). In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, including finite-lived intangibles as described below, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from its use of the asset and its eventual disposition, where applicable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external market participant assumptions and discounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal (commonly referred to as assets held-for-sale) are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.\nLeases\nThe Company's lease arrangements primarily relate to real estate, including its retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, corporate offices, and warehouse facilities and, to a lesser extent, certain equipment and other assets. The Company's leases generally have initial terms ranging from \n3\n to \n10\n years and may include renewal or early-termination options, rent escalation clauses, and/or lease incentives in the form of construction allowances and rent abatements. The Company is typically required to make fixed minimum rent payments, variable rent payments based on performance (e.g., percentage-of-sales-based payments), or a combination thereof, relating to its right to use an underlying leased asset. The Company is also often required to pay for certain other costs that do not relate specifically to its right to use an underlying leased asset, but that are associated with the asset, including real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees, and/or certain other costs (referred to collectively herein as \"non-lease components\"), which may be fixed or variable in amount, depending on the terms of the respective lease agreement. The Company's leases do not contain significantly restrictive covenants or residual value guarantees.\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at the arrangement's inception. If a lease is determined to exist, its related term is assessed at the lease commencement date, once the underlying asset is made available by the lessor for the Company's use. The Company's assessment of the lease term reflects the non-cancellable period of the lease, inclusive of any rent-free periods, plus any periods covered by early-termination options for which the Company is not considered reasonably certain of exercising, as well as periods covered by renewal options for which it is considered reasonably certain of exercising. The Company also determines lease classification as either \noperating\n or \nfinance\n at lease commencement, which governs the pattern of expense recognition and the presentation thereof in the consolidated statements of operations over the lease term.\nFor leases with a lease term exceeding 12 months, a liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the lease commencement date reflecting the present value of its related fixed payment obligations over such term. A corresponding right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset equal to the initial lease liability is also recorded, increased by any prepaid rent and/or initial direct costs incurred in connection with execution of the lease, and reduced by any incentives provided by the lessor. The Company also includes fixed payment obligations related to non-lease components in the measurement of its ROU assets and lease liabilities, \nF-15\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ngiven its election to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component. Variable lease payments are not included in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets associated with finance leases are presented separately from those associated with operating leases, and are included within property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet. For purposes of measuring the present value of its fixed payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined based on information available at lease commencement, given that rates implicit in its leasing arrangements are not readily determinable. The Company's incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it would pay to borrow on a secured basis an amount equal to the lease payments and incorporates the term and economic environment of the lease.\nFor operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the initial ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the remaining lease liability, which is ultimately reduced by the related fixed payments as they are made. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less (referred to as a \"short-term lease\"), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over such term and are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. For all leases, variable lease cost, if any, is recognized as incurred.\nROU assets, along with any related long-lived assets, are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see Note 12). To the extent that such assets are ultimately determined to be impaired, they are written down accordingly on a relative carrying amount basis, with the ROU asset written down to an amount no lower than its estimated fair value. Subsequent to the recognition of any such impairment, total remaining lease cost is recognized on a front-loaded basis over the remaining lease term.\nUnder certain of its lease arrangements, the Company is contractually obligated to remove its leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. For such arrangements, the Company records an asset retirement obligation (\"ARO\") at lease inception for the estimated fair value, with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The ARO is adjusted for any changes in estimates and the related long-lived asset is depreciated over its useful life. Activity related to these obligations were not material during any of the fiscal years presented. The Company's ARO balances are recorded within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 7).\nSee Note 14 for further discussion of the Company's leases.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAt acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which typically consist of reacquired license agreements, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and/or order backlog. The fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on management's assessment, considering independent third-party appraisals when necessary. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired, both tangible and intangible, is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. The Company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analyses using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of such assets are less than their respective carrying values. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value, a quantitative test is performed. Under the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess. The Company also periodically performs a quantitative test to assess its goodwill for impairment in lieu of using the qualitative approach in order to reassess the fair values of its reporting units. \nFinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. See discussion of the Company's accounting policy for long-lived asset impairment as previously described under the caption \"\nProperty and Equipment, Net.\n\"\nF-16\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nIncome Taxes \nIncome taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes payable/refunds receivable, and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit carryforwards, and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment.\nIn addition, valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur or circumstances change that warrant adjustments.\nIn determining the income tax benefit (provision) for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If the Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the Company's estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax benefit (provision) in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months. Interest and penalties are recorded within the income tax benefit (provision) in the consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets together with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company accounts for the minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") in the period in which it is incurred.\nSee Note 10 for further discussion of the Company's income taxes\n.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company records derivative financial instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting are either (i) offset through earnings against the changes in fair value of the related hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments or (ii) recognized in equity as a component of AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on whether the instrument is hedging against changes in fair value or cash flows and net investments, respectively.\nEach derivative instrument that qualifies for hedge accounting is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the risk associated with the related exposure. For each instrument that is designated as a hedge, the Company documents the related risk management objective and strategy, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, and the risk exposure, as well as how hedge effectiveness will be assessed over the instrument's term. To assess hedge effectiveness at the inception of a hedging relationship, the Company generally uses regression analysis, a statistical method, to evaluate how changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of the related hedged item. The extent to which a hedging instrument has been and is expected to remain highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows is assessed by the Company on at least a quarterly basis.\nGiven its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, the Company's policy is to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. The Company's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of its counterparties' creditworthiness. The Company also enters into master netting \nF-17\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\narrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. In the event of default or termination, these arrangements allow the Company to net-settle amounts payable and receivable related to multiple derivative transactions with the same counterparty. The master netting arrangements specify a number of events of default and termination, including the failure to make timely payments.\nThe fair values of the Company's derivative instruments are recorded on its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. For cash flow reporting purposes, proceeds received or amounts paid upon the settlement of a derivative instrument are classified in the same manner as the related item being hedged, primarily within cash flows from operating activities for its forward foreign exchange contracts and within cash flows from investing activities for its cross-currency swap contracts, both as discussed below.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency. To the extent designated as cash flow hedges, related gains or losses on such instruments are initially deferred in equity as a component of AOCI and are subsequently recognized within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations when the related inventory is sold.\nIf a derivative instrument is dedesignated or if hedge accounting is discontinued because the instrument is not expected to be highly effective in hedging the designated exposure, any further gains (losses) are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net. Upon discontinuance of hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the derivative instrument recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the related hedged item affects earnings, consistent with the hedging strategy, unless the related forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring, in which case the accumulated amount is immediately recognized within other income (expense), net.\nHedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations\nThe Company periodically uses cross-currency swap contracts to reduce risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations on certain of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Changes in the fair values of such derivative instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. In assessing the effectiveness of such hedges, the Company uses a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both its foreign subsidiary net investment and the related hedging instrument. Under this method, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument other than those due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are amortized into earnings as interest expense using a systematic and rational method over the instrument's term. Changes in fair value associated with the effective portion (i.e., those due to changes in the spot rate) are recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment.\nUndesignated Hedges\nThe Company uses undesignated hedges primarily to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk related to third-party and intercompany balances and exposures. Changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net.\nSee Note 13 for further discussion of the Company's derivative financial instruments\n.\nF-18\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n4.    \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2024-03, \"Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\" (\"ASU 2024-03\"). ASU 2024-03 requires interim and annual tabular disclosure of disaggregated information for certain income statement expense captions. Specific expense categories required to be disclosed quantitatively include inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization, as well as other specified expense categories currently disclosed under existing disclosure requirements. Additionally, any remaining amounts that are not separately disaggregated are required to be described qualitatively. ASU 2024-03 also requires separate disclosure of total selling expenses incurred each reporting period, with annual disclosure of the entity's definition of selling expenses. The annual disclosures required by ASU 2024-03 are effective for the Company beginning in its fiscal year ending April 1, 2028 (\"Fiscal 2028\"), with interim disclosures effective beginning in its fiscal year ending March 31, 2029 (\"Fiscal 2029\"). The provisions of ASU 2024-03 are to be applied prospectively, although retrospective application is permitted. Early adoption is also permitted. Other than the new disclosure requirements, ASU 2024-03 will not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-09\"). ASU 2023-09 is intended to enhance the transparency and usefulness of annual income tax disclosures. Among its provisions, ASU 2023-09 requires disclosure of a reconciliation between an entity's effective tax rate, which is calculated by dividing each fiscal period's income tax provision by pretax income, and its statutory rate utilizing eight specific categories, along with a separate disclosure for reconciling items that meet a 5% quantitative threshold. In addition, ASU 2023-09 requires disclosure of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, as well as by individual jurisdictions if a 5% quantitative threshold is met. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning in Fiscal 2026, and is to be applied prospectively, although retrospective application is permitted. Early adoption is also permitted. Other than the new disclosure requirements, ASU 2023-09 will not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, \"Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-07\"). ASU 2023-07 requires entities to make certain enhanced segment disclosures on both an annual and interim basis, including disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to their chief operating decision maker (the \"CODM\") as defined within Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, \"Segment Reporting,\" as well as various information about an entity's CODM, among other provisions. ASU 2023-07 does not change how entities identify their operating segments, aggregate them, or apply the quantitative thresholds to determine their reportable segments. The annual disclosures required by ASU 2023-07 are effective for the Company beginning in Fiscal 2025, with interim disclosures effective beginning in Fiscal 2026. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025 and applied its provisions on a retrospective basis. Other than the new disclosure requirements, ASU 2023-07 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 20 for further discussion of the Company's segments.\nDisclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, \"Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\" (\"ASU 2022-04\"). ASU 2022-04 requires entities to disclose the key terms of supplier finance programs they use in connection with the purchase of goods and services, along with the amount of obligations outstanding at the end of each period and an annual rollforward of such obligations. This standard does not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations. ASU 2022-04 became effective for the Company beginning in Fiscal 2024.

(Continued)\n9.    \nRestructuring and Other Charges, Net\nA description of significant restructuring and other activities and their related costs is provided below.\nFiscal 2025 Restructuring Activities\nDuring Fiscal 2025, the Company recorded \nrestructuring-related charges\n of $\n20.4\n million, comprised of cash-related restructuring charges of $\n15.5\n million, primarily associated with severance and benefit costs, and non-cash-related charges of $\n4.9\n million, primarily related to stock-based compensation expense recorded in connection with an employment separation agreement. As of March 29, 2025, the remaining liability related to the cash-related charges was $\n10.9\n million, reflecting cash payments of $\n4.6\n million made during Fiscal 2025.\nFiscal 2024 Restructuring Activities\nDuring Fiscal 2024, the Company recorded cumulative \nrestructuring-related charges\n of $\n55.8\n million, comprised of cash-related charges of $\n54.5\n million, primarily associated with severance and benefit costs, and non-cash-related charges of $\n1.3\n million. As of March 29, 2025, the remaining liability related to the cash-related charges was $\n8.0\n million, reflecting cash payments of $\n22.4\n million and $\n0.2\n million of non-cash adjustments made during Fiscal 2025. As of March 30, 2024, the remaining liability related to the cash-related charges was $\n30.2\n million, reflecting cash payments of $\n24.1\n million and $\n0.2\n million of non-cash adjustments made during Fiscal 2024.\nFiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan\nFrom Fiscal 2021 through Fiscal 2023, the Company undertook efforts to realign its resources to support future growth and profitability, and to create a sustainable, enhanced cost structure. The key areas of the Company's initiatives underlying these efforts involved evaluation of its: (i) team organizational structures and ways of working; (ii) real estate footprint and related costs across its corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and (iii) brand portfolio.\nIn connection with the first initiative, on September 17, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the \"Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan\") to reduce its global workforce. Additionally, during a preliminary review of its store portfolio during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, the Company decided to close its Polo store on Regent Street in London. \nShortly thereafter, on October 29, 2020, the Company announced the planned transition of its Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with its long-term brand elevation strategy and in connection with its third initiative. Specifically, the Company entered into a multi-year licensing partnership, which took effect on August 1, 2021 following a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to manufacture, market, and distribute Chaps menswear and womenswear. This agreement created incremental value for the Company by enabling an even greater focus on elevating its core brands in the marketplace, reducing its direct exposure to the North America department store channel, and setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner that is focused on nurturing the brand. \nLater, on February 3, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved additional actions related to its real estate initiative. Specifically, the Company further rightsized and consolidated its global corporate offices to better align with its organizational profile and new ways of working. The Company also closed certain of its stores to improve overall profitability. Additionally, the Company further consolidated its North America distribution centers in order to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability, and deliver a better consumer experience.\nFinally, on June 26, 2021, in connection with its brand portfolio initiative, the Company sold its former Club Monaco business to Regent, L.P., a global private equity firm, with \nno\n resulting gain or loss on sale realized during the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year ending April 2, 2022. Regent, L.P. acquired Club Monaco's assets and liabilities in exchange for potential future cash consideration payable to the Company, including earn-out payments based on Club Monaco meeting certain defined revenue thresholds over a five-year period. Accordingly, the Company has realized amounts related to the receipt of such contingent consideration (as discussed further below) and additional amounts may be realized in the future. Additionally, in connection with this divestiture, the Company provided Regent, L.P. with certain operational support for a transitional period of approximately one year, varying by functional area. \nF-24\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nActions associated with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan were completed in Fiscal 2023 and no additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with this plan. \nA summary of the charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan during the fiscal years presented, as well as the cumulative charges recorded since its inception (inclusive of other immaterial restructuring-related charges previously recorded during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021), is as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nCumulative Charges\nApril 1,\n2023\n \n(millions)\nCash-related restructuring charges:\nSeverance and benefit costs\n$\n8.6\n \n$\n147.1\n \nOther cash charges\n3.9\n \n26.5\n \nTotal cash-related restructuring charges\n12.5\n \n173.6\n \nNon-cash charges:\nImpairment of assets (see Note 8)\n0.2\n \n90.9\n \nInventory-related charges\n(a)\n \n0.3\n \n8.6\n \nAccelerated stock-based compensation expense\n(b)\n \n—\n \n2.0\n \nOther non-cash charges\n6.7\n \n6.7\n \nTotal non-cash charges\n7.2\n \n108.2\n \nTotal charges\n$\n19.7\n \n$\n281.8\n \n \n(a)\nInventory-related charges are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations.\n(b)\nAccelerated stock-based compensation expense, which was recorded within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations, related to vesting provisions associated with certain separation agreements.\nIn addition to the charges summarized above, the Company recognized income of $\n2.8\n million, $\n7.0\n million, and $\n3.5\n million during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively, related to cash consideration received from Regent, L.P. in connection with the Company's previously sold Club Monaco business, pursuant to certain clauses included in the securities and asset purchase agreement. The Company donated this income to The Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, a non-profit, charitable foundation, which resulted in related offsetting donation expense of $\n2.8\n million, $\n7.0\n million, and $\n3.5\n million during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively. The income and related offsetting donation expense amounts during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023 were all recorded within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nF-25\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nA summary of the activity in the restructuring reserve related to the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan during the fiscal years presented is as follows:\nSeverance and Benefit Costs\nOther Cash Charges\nTotal\n(millions)\nBalance at April 2, 2022\n$\n30.6\n \n$\n0.1\n \n$\n30.7\n \nAdditions charged to expense\n8.6\n \n3.9\n \n12.5\n \nCash payments applied against reserve\n(\n18.2\n)\n(\n4.0\n)\n(\n22.2\n)\nNon-cash adjustments\n(\n0.3\n)\n—\n \n(\n0.3\n)\nBalance at April 1, 2023\n20.7\n \n—\n \n20.7\n \nCash payments applied against reserve\n(\n16.6\n)\n—\n \n(\n16.6\n)\nNon-cash adjustments\n0.1\n \n—\n \n0.1\n \nBalance at March 30, 2024\n4.2\n \n—\n \n4.2\n \nCash payments applied against reserve\n(\n3.8\n)\n—\n \n(\n3.8\n)\nBalance at March 29, 2025\n$\n0.4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n0.4\n \nOther Charges\nNext Generation Transformation Project\nThe Company is in the early stages of executing a large-scale, multi-year global project that is expected to significantly transform the way in which the Company operates its business and further enable its long-term strategic pivot towards a global direct-to-consumer-oriented model (the \"Next Generation Transformation project\" or \"NGT project\"). The NGT project will be completed in phases and involves the redesigning of certain end-to-end processes and the implementation of a suite of technology systems on a global scale. Such efforts are expected to result in significant process improvements and the creation of synergies across core areas of operations, including merchandise buying and planning, procurement, inventory management, retail and wholesale operations, and financial planning and reporting, better enabling the Company to optimize inventory levels and increase the speed with which it reacts to changes in consumer demand across markets, among other benefits.

The net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in the Company's fiscal year ending April 3, 2032. \nThe Company also has available state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $\n5.4\n million and $\n1.7\n million (both net of tax), respectively, for which no net deferred tax asset has been recognized. A full valuation allowance has been recorded against these carryforwards since the Company does not believe that it will more likely than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Subsequent recognition of these deferred tax assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such recognition. The valuation allowance relating to state net operating loss carryforwards remains consistent with prior year for jurisdictions where the Company will no longer be able to utilize the carryforwards in the future. The valuation allowance relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards decreased by $\n0.5\n million, mainly due to the write-off of related net operating losses in jurisdictions where the Company will no longer be able to utilize the carryforwards in the future.\nF-28\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nIn January 2018, new U.S. tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") became effective. The TCJA significantly revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, creating a territorial tax system that included a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings. As a result of the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the TCJA, the Company reevaluated its permanent reinvestment assertion and determined that undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the TCJA's one-time mandatory transition tax were no longer considered to be permanently reinvested, effective December 31, 2017. The mandatory transition tax does not apply to undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017. Accordingly, provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on approximately $\n3.717\n billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries generated after December 31, 2017, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. These earnings could become subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were lent to RLC, a subsidiary or a U.S. affiliate of RLC, or if the stock of the subsidiaries were sold. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.\nUncertain Income Tax Benefits\nFiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023 Activity\nReconciliations of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023 are presented below:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\n \n(millions)\nUnrecognized tax benefits beginning balance\n$\n98.4\n \n$\n77.1\n \n$\n75.4\n \nAdditions related to current period tax positions\n32.5\n \n21.7\n \n13.3\n \nAdditions related to prior period tax positions\n41.8\n \n2.4\n \n0.6\n \nReductions related to prior period tax positions\n(\n0.6\n)\n(\n0.9\n)\n(\n4.3\n)\nReductions related to expiration of statutes of limitations\n(\n2.6\n)\n(\n1.0\n)\n(\n2.9\n)\nReductions related to settlements with taxing authorities\n—\n \n(\n0.1\n)\n(\n4.5\n)\nReductions related to foreign currency translation\n(\n0.4\n)\n(\n0.8\n)\n(\n0.5\n)\nUnrecognized tax benefits ending balance\n$\n169.1\n \n$\n98.4\n \n$\n77.1\n \nThe Company classifies interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its provision for income taxes. \nReconciliations of the beginning and ending amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits for Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023 are presented below:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \nMarch 29,\n2025\n \nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\n \n(millions)\nAccrued interest and penalties beginning balance\n$\n20.3\n \n$\n16.7\n \n$\n16.5\n \nNet additions charged to expense\n4.1\n \n3.9\n \n2.6\n \nReductions related to prior period tax positions\n(\n0.1\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\n(\n1.9\n)\nReductions related to settlements with taxing authorities\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.4\n)\nReductions related to foreign currency translation\n(\n0.1\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\nAccrued interest and penalties ending balance\n$\n24.2\n \n$\n20.3\n \n$\n16.7\n \nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, was $\n193.3\n million and $\n118.7\n million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively, and was included within the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate was $\n101.6\n million and $\n80.1\n million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively.\nF-29\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOn August 26, 2024, the U.S. Tax Court issued a decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner related to the TCJA deduction for certain deemed foreign dividends otherwise subject to the transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of applicable foreign subsidiaries. Based on the Company's evaluation of the technical merits of this decision, during Fiscal 2025 it filed a protective refund claim with the Internal Revenue Service claiming a transition tax refund of $\n34.4\n million, for which the Company recorded a corresponding deferred tax asset. However, as the Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that the intended refund claim will not be received, during Fiscal 2025 it also recorded an uncertain tax position reserve for the full refund claim of $\n34.4\n million. Accordingly, on a net basis, this development had no resulting impact to the Company's effective tax rates or its consolidated statements of operations during Fiscal 2025. \nFuture Changes in Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company's tax positions is subject to change based on future events including, but not limited to, settlements of ongoing tax audits and assessments and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, the Company does not anticipate that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, will change significantly during the next twelve months. However, changes in the occurrence, expected outcomes, and timing of such events could cause the Company's current estimate to change materially in the future.\nThe Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is generally no longer subject to examinations by the relevant tax authorities for years prior to its fiscal year ended March 29, 2014.\n11.    \nDebt\nDebt consists of the following:\nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\n(millions)\n$400 million 3.750% Senior Notes\n(a)\n \n$\n399.7\n \n$\n399.0\n \n$750 million 2.950% Senior Notes\n(b)\n \n742.9\n \n741.5\n \nTotal debt\n1,142.6\n \n1,140.5\n \nLess: current portion of long-term debt\n399.7\n \n—\n \nTotal long-term debt\n$\n742.9\n \n$\n1,140.5\n \n \n(a)\nThe carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes is presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $\n0.3\n million and $\n1.0\n million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively.\n(b)\nThe carrying value of the 2.950% Senior Notes is presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $\n7.1\n million and $\n8.5\n million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively.\nSenior Notes\nIn August 2018, the Company completed a registered public debt offering and issued $\n400\n million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due \nSeptember 15, 2025\n, which bear interest at a fixed rate of \n3.750\n%, payable semi-annually (the \"3.750% Senior Notes\"). The 3.750% Senior Notes were issued at a price equal to \n99.521\n% of their principal amount. The proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Company's previously outstanding $\n300\n million principal amount of \n2.125\n% unsecured senior notes that matured \nSeptember 26, 2018\n.\nIn June 2020, the Company completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional $\n500\n million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes that were due and repaid on \nJune 15, 2022\n with cash on hand, which bore interest at a fixed rate of \n1.700\n%, payable semi-annually (the \"1.700% Senior Notes\"), and $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due \nJune 15, 2030\n, which bear interest at a fixed rate of \n2.950\n%, payable semi-annually (the \"2.950% Senior Notes\"). The 1.700% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes were issued at prices equal to \n99.880\n% and \n98.995\n% of their principal amounts, respectively. The proceeds from these offerings were used for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of $\n475\n million previously outstanding under the Company's Global Credit Facility (as defined \nF-30\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nbelow) on June 3, 2020 and repayment of its previously outstanding $\n300\n million principal amount of \n2.625\n% unsecured senior notes that matured \nAugust 18, 2020\n.\nThe Company has the option to redeem the 3.750% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes (collectively, the \"Senior Notes\"), in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption date plus the greater of (i) \n100\n% of the principal amount of the series of Senior Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present value of Remaining Scheduled Payments, as defined in the supplemental indentures governing such Senior Notes (together with the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the \"Indenture\"). \nThe Indenture contains certain covenants that restrict the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any financial covenants.\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company has a commercial paper borrowing program that allows it to issue up to $\n750\n million of unsecured commercial paper notes through private placement using third-party broker-dealers (the \"Commercial Paper Program\").\nBorrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility (as defined below). Accordingly, the Company does not expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and Global Credit Facility to exceed $\n750\n million. Commercial Paper Program borrowings may be used to support the Company's general working capital and corporate needs. Maturities of commercial paper notes vary, but cannot exceed \n397\n days from the date of issuance. Commercial paper notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program rank equally in seniority with the Company's other forms of unsecured indebtedness. As of both March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, there were \nno\n borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nGlobal Credit Facility\nIn June 2023, the Company terminated its then existing credit facility and entered into a new credit facility that provides for a $\n750\n million senior unsecured revolving line of credit through \nJune 30, 2028\n (the \"Global Credit Facility\") under terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the previous facility. The Global Credit Facility may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures, certain investments, general corporate purposes, and for funding of acquisitions. The Global Credit Facility may also be used to support the issuance of letters of credit and maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and certain other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen, and are guaranteed by some of the Company's domestic subsidiaries, including all of the Company's significant subsidiaries. In accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the Global Credit Facility, the Company has the ability to expand its borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $\n1.500\n billion, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.\nBorrowings under the Global Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company's option, either (a) an alternate base rate or (b) an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") rate or the applicable currency in which the loans are made (the \"Term Benchmark Rate\") plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for Term Benchmark Rate loans will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the \"Pricing Grid\"), which is included in the definition of \"Applicable Rate\" within the Global Credit Facility agreement and is based on ratings for the Company's senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness provided by established ratings agencies. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Global Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee, calculated at a rate per annum determined in accordance with the Pricing Grid, on the average daily unused amount of the Facility, payable quarterly in arrears, and certain fees with respect to Letters of Credit that are issued. The current commitment fee rate of \n8\n basis points is subject to adjustment based on the Company's credit ratings. As of both March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, there were \nno\n borrowings outstanding under the Global Credit Facility. However, the Company was contingently liable for $\n10.6\n million and $\n11.8\n million of outstanding letters of credit as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively.\nThe Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances, or \nF-31\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nguarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make certain investments. The Global Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the \"leverage ratio\") of no greater than \n4.25\n as of the date of measurement for the \nfour\n most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt outstanding, including finance lease obligations, plus all operating lease obligations. Consolidated EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) operating lease cost, (v) restructuring and other non-recurring expenses, and (vi) acquisition-related costs.\n \nUpon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Global Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Global Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Global Credit Facility specifies various events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal, interest, and fee payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Global Credit Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of the Company's common stock. As of March 29, 2025, \nno Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company's Global Credit Facility\n.\nPan-Asia Borrowing Facilities\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries in Asia have uncommitted credit facilities with regional branches of JPMorgan Chase in China and South Korea (the \"Pan-Asia Credit Facilities\"). Additionally, the Company's Japan subsidiary has an uncommitted overdraft facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (the \"Japan Overdraft Facility\"). The Pan-Asia Credit Facilities and Japan Overdraft Facility (collectively, the \"Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities\") are subject to annual renewal and may be used to fund general working capital needs of the Company's operations in the respective countries. Borrowings under the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the respective banks, subject to availability of the banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. The Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities do not contain any financial covenants.\nA summary of the Company's Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities by country is as follows:\n•\nChina Credit Facility\n — provides Ralph Lauren Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. with a revolving line of credit of up to \n100\n million Chinese Renminbi (approximately $\n13\n million) through \nApril 3, 2026\n, which is also able to be used to support bank guarantees.\n•\nSouth Korea Credit Facility\n — provides Ralph Lauren (Korea) Ltd. with a revolving line of credit of up to \n30\n billion South Korean Won (approximately $\n20\n million) through \nOctober 24, 2025\n.\n•\nJapan Overdraft Facility\n — provides Ralph Lauren Corporation Japan with an overdraft amount of up to \n5\n billion Japanese Yen (approximately $\n33\n million) through \nApril 30, 2026\n.\nAs of both March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, there were \nno\n borrowings outstanding under the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities.\n12.    \nFair Value Measurements\nU.S. GAAP prescribes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The determination of the applicable level within the hierarchy for a particular asset or liability depends on the inputs used in its valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs are market-based (observable) or internally-derived (unobservable). A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:\n•\nLevel 1\n — inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2\n — inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable.\nF-32\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n•\nLevel 3\n — inputs to the valuation methodology based on unobservable prices or valuation techniques that are significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components:\nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\n \n(millions)\nDerivative assets\n(a)\n \n$\n30.9\n \n$\n36.6\n \nDerivative liabilities\n(a)\n \n10.1\n \n5.5\n \n(a)\nBased on Level 2 measurements.\nThe Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets and are valued using pricing models that are primarily based on market observable external inputs, including spot and forward currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and discount rates consistent with the instrument's tenor, and consider the impact of the Company's own credit risk, if any. Changes in counterparty credit risk are also considered in the valuation of derivative financial instruments.\nTo the extent the Company invests in commercial paper, such investments are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets using external pricing data, based on interest rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's investments. To the extent the Company invests in bonds, such investments are also classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets based on quoted prices in active markets.\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and time deposits are recorded at carrying value, which generally approximates fair value based on Level 1 measurements.\nThe Company's debt instruments are recorded at their amortized cost in its consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair values. The fair values of the Company's senior notes are estimated based on external pricing data, including available quoted market prices, and with reference to comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates, credit ratings, and trading frequency, among other factors. The fair values of the Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, are estimated using external pricing data, based on interest rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's outstanding borrowings. Due to their short-term nature, the fair values of the Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, generally approximate their amortized cost carrying values.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying values and the estimated fair values of the Company's debt instruments:\n \nMarch 29, 2025\nMarch 30, 2024\n \nCarrying Value\n(a)\nFair Value\n(b)\nCarrying Value\n(a)\nFair Value\n(b)\n \n(millions)\n$400 million 3.750% Senior Notes\n$\n399.7\n \n$\n398.4\n \n$\n399.0\n \n$\n391.4\n \n$750 million 2.950% Senior Notes\n742.9\n \n690.8\n \n741.5\n \n671.4\n \n \n(a)\nSee Note 11 for discussion of the carrying values of the Company's senior notes.\n(b)\nBased on Level 2 measurements.\nUnrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the Company's debt instruments do not result in the realization or expenditure of cash unless the debt is retired prior to its maturity.\nF-33\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNon-financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company's non-financial assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, other intangible assets, property and equipment, and lease-related ROU assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and instead are reported at their amortized or depreciated cost in its consolidated balance sheet. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be fully recoverable (and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), the respective carrying value of non-financial assets are assessed for impairment and, if ultimately considered impaired, are adjusted and written down to their fair value, as estimated based on consideration of external market participant assumptions and discounted cash flows.\nDuring Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values. The fair values of these assets were determined based on Level 3 measurements, the related inputs of which included estimates of the amount and timing of the assets' net future discounted cash flows (including any potential sublease income for lease-related ROU assets), based on historical experience and consideration of current trends, market conditions, and comparable sales, as applicable. \nNo\n impairment charges were recorded during Fiscal 2024. \nThe following table summarizes impairment charges recorded by the Company during the fiscal years presented to reduce the carrying values of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values as of the assessment date:\nFiscal Years Ended\nMarch 29, 2025\nMarch 30, 2024\nApril 1, 2023\nLong-Lived Asset Category\nTotal Impairments\nFair Value \nas of Impairment Date\nTotal Impairments\nFair Value \nas of Impairment Date\nTotal Impairments\nFair Value \nas of Impairment Date\n \n(millions)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n0.8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nN/A\n$\n0.2\n \n$\n—\n \nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n—\n \nN/A\n—\n \nN/A\n9.5\n \n14.8\n \nSee Note 8 for additional discussion regarding impairment charges recorded by the Company within the consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal years presented.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill assessment using a qualitative approach as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2025. In performing the assessment, the Company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affected the fair values and/or carrying amounts of its reporting units with allocated goodwill. These factors included external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as the Company's actual and expected financial performance. Additionally, the Company also considered the results of its most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, the results of which indicated that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values.

Accordingly, based on its assessment thereof, the Company may use derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate such risks.

As part of its overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, the Company generally hedges a portion of its related exposures anticipated over the next \ntwelve months\n using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of \ntwo months\n to \none year\n to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.\nCross-Currency Swap Contracts\nThe Company periodically designates pay-fixed rate, receive fixed-rate cross-currency swap contracts as hedges of its net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries. These contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments based on the contract's notional amount and the fixed rate of interest payable on certain of the Company's senior notes for Euro-denominated fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically converting a portion of its fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to fixed-rate Euro-denominated obligations.\nSee Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies relating to its derivative financial instruments.\nInvestments\nThe Company's short-term investments as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024 were $\n160.5\n million and $\n121.0\n million, respectively, and consisted of time deposits.\nNo significant realized or unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments or impairment charges were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented.\nRefer to Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies relating to its investments.\nF-37\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n14.    \nLeases\nThe following table summarizes ROU assets and lease liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets:\nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nLocation Recorded on Balance Sheet\n(millions)\nAssets:\nOperating leases\n$\n1,013.1\n \n$\n1,014.6\n \nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nFinance leases\n198.3\n \n218.2\n \nProperty and equipment, net\nTotal lease assets\n$\n1,211.4\n \n$\n1,232.8\n \nLiabilities:\nOperating leases\n:\nCurrent portion\n$\n225.4\n \n$\n245.5\n \nCurrent operating lease liabilities\nNon-current portion\n1,044.7\n \n1,014.0\n \nLong-term \noperating lease liabilities\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n1,270.1\n \n1,259.5\n \nFinance leases\n:\nCurrent portion\n20.6\n \n19.2\n \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\nNon-current portion\n234.8\n \n256.1\n \nLong-term finance lease liabilities\nTotal finance lease liabilities\n255.4\n \n275.3\n \nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n1,525.5\n \n$\n1,534.8\n \nThe following table summarizes the composition of total lease cost during the fiscal years presented:\nFiscal Years Ended\nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\nLocation Recorded in Earnings\n(millions)\nOperating lease cost\n$\n292.5\n \n$\n295.0\n \n$\n294.3\n \n(a)\nFinance lease costs\n:\nDepreciation of leased assets\n23.1\n \n24.0\n \n24.5\n \n(b)\nAccretion of lease liabilities\n7.7\n \n9.1\n \n11.2\n \nInterest expense\nVariable lease cost\n371.4\n \n340.7\n \n318.3\n \n(c)\nShort-term lease cost\n1.8\n \n2.6\n \n2.8\n \nSG&A expenses\nSublease income\n(\n7.4\n)\n(\n6.5\n)\n(\n8.2\n)\nRestructuring and other charges, net\nTotal lease cost\n$\n689.1\n \n$\n664.9\n \n$\n642.9\n \n \n(a)\nDuring Fiscal 2025, $\n3.4\n million was included within cost of goods sold, $\n279.2\n million was included within SG&A expenses, and $\n9.9\n million was included within restructuring and other charges, net.

The Company believes at present that the resolution of currently pending matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company's assessment of any current litigation or other legal claims could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations by judges, juries, or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company may enter into certain guarantees or other agreements that provide general indemnifications. The Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements in the past and does not currently anticipate incurring any material indemnification payments.\n \n16.    \nEquity\nCapital Stock\nThe Company's capital stock consists of \ntwo\n classes of common stock. There are \n500\n million shares of Class A common stock and \n100\n million shares of Class B common stock authorized to be issued. Shares of Class A and Class B common stock have substantially identical rights, except with respect to voting rights. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to \none\n vote per share and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to \nten\n votes per share. Holders of both stock classes vote together as a single class on all matters presented to the stockholders for their approval, except with respect to the election and removal of directors or as otherwise required by applicable law. All outstanding shares of Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family, and are convertible at any time into shares of Class A common stock on a \none-for-one\n basis.\nClass B Common Stock Conversions\nDuring Fiscal 2024, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., a limited liability company managed by the children of Mr. Ralph Lauren, converted \n3.0\n million shares of Class B common stock into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the security's terms. These conversions occurred in connection with a long-term strategy for estate planning and investment diversification. These transactions resulted in a reclassification within equity and had no other effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. \nF-40\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nA summary of the Company's repurchases of Class A common stock under its common stock repurchase program is as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended\nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\n(in millions)\nCost of shares repurchased\n(a)\n \n$\n424.5\n \n$\n398.2\n \n$\n454.3\n \nNumber of shares repurchased\n2.3\n \n2.9\n \n4.8\n \n(a)\nExcludes excise tax of $\n3.5\n million and $\n3.3\n million incurred during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively.

Dividends paid amounted to $\n201.1\n million, $\n194.6\n million, and $\n198.3\n million for Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively.\nOn May 15, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors approved an additional increase to the Company's quarterly cash dividend on its common stock from $\n0.825\n to $\n0.9125\n per share. The first quarterly dividend to reflect this increase is expected to be payable to shareholders of record at close of business on June 27, 2025 and paid on July 11, 2025.\nThe Company intends to continue to pay regular dividends on outstanding shares of its common stock.

The 2019 Incentive Plan provided for \n1.2\n million of new shares authorized for issuance to the participants, in addition to the approximately \n3.0\n million shares that remained available for issuance under the 2010 Incentive Plan as of August 1, 2019. In addition, any outstanding awards under the 2010 Incentive Plan or the Company's 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the \"1997 Incentive Plan\") that expire, are forfeited, or are surrendered to the Company in satisfaction of taxes, will become available for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan became effective August 1, 2019 and no further grants will be made under the 2010 Incentive Plan. Outstanding awards issued prior to August 1, 2019 will continue to remain subject to the terms of the 2010 Incentive Plan or 1997 Incentive Plan, as applicable. As of March 29, 2025, \n2.2\n million shares remained available for future issuance under the Company's incentive plans.\n Stock-based compensation awards that may be made under the 2019 Incentive Plan include, but are not limited to, (i) RSUs, (ii) restricted stock, and (iii) stock options. During the fiscal years presented, annual grants consisted entirely of RSUs. For RSUs granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, vesting continues post-retirement for all or a portion of the remaining unvested RSUs.\nImpact on Results\nA summary of total stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefits recognized is as follows:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\n \n(millions)\nCompensation expense\n(a)\n \n$\n107.9\n \n$\n99.5\n \n$\n75.5\n \nIncome tax benefit\n(\n14.9\n)\n(\n14.8\n)\n(\n12.6\n)\n(a)\nFiscal 2025 includes $\n5.3\n million of stock-based compensation expense related to an employment separation agreement recorded within restructuring and other charges, net in the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 9). All other stock-based compensation expense was recorded within SG&A expenses.\nThe Company issues its annual grants of stock-based compensation awards in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Due to the timing of the annual grants and other factors, including the timing and magnitude of forfeiture and performance goal achievement adjustments, as well as changes to the size and composition of the eligible employee population, stock-based compensation expense recognized during any given fiscal period is not indicative of the level of compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods.\nService-based RSUs\nService-based RSUs granted to certain of the Company's senior executives and other employees, as well as non-employee directors, generally vest over a \nthree-year\n period, subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed). The fair values of service-based RSUs are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue to the holder while outstanding and unvested.\nF-43\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nA summary of service-based RSU activity during Fiscal 2025 is as follows:\nService-\nbased RSUs\n \nNumber of\nShares\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\n \n(thousands)\nUnvested at March 30, 2024\n1,054\n \n$\n107.27\n \nGranted\n432\n \n160.54\n \nVested\n(\n552\n)\n110.11\n \nForfeited\n(\n55\n)\n121.77\n \nUnvested at March 29, 2025\n879\n \n$\n130.75\n \nService-\nbased RSUs\nTotal unrecognized compensation expense at March 29, 2025 (millions)\n$\n37.8\n \nWeighted-average period expected to be recognized over (years)\n1.2\nAdditional information pertaining to service-based RSU activity is as follows:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\nService-based RSUs:\nWeighted-average grant date fair value of awards granted\n$\n160.54\n \n$\n115.55\n \n$\n92.07\n \nTotal fair value of awards vested (millions)\n$\n94.0\n \n$\n119.0\n \n$\n56.7\n \nPerformance-based RSUs\nThe Company grants performance-based RSUs to its senior executives and other key employees. The fair values of performance-based RSUs are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. Performance-based RSUs generally vest (i) upon the completion of a \nthree-year\n period of time (cliff vesting), subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the Company's achievement of certain performance goals established at the beginning of the \nthree-year\n performance period or (ii) ratably, over a \nthree-year\n period of time (graded vesting), subject to the employee's continuing employment during the applicable vesting period (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the achievement by the Company of certain performance goals in the initial year of the \nthree-year\n vesting period.\nFor performance-based RSUs subject to cliff vesting, the number of shares that may be earned ranges between \n0\n% (if the specified threshold performance level is not attained) and \n200\n% (if performance meets or exceeds the maximum achievement level) of the awards originally granted. If actual performance exceeds the pre-established threshold, the number of shares earned is calculated based on the relative performance between specified levels of achievement.\nF-44\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nMarket-based RSUs\nThe Company grants cliff vesting RSU awards to its senior executives and other key employees, which, in addition to being subject to continuing employment requirements (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed), are also subject to a market condition based on a TSR performance metric. The number of shares that vest upon the completion of a \nthree-year\n period of time is determined by comparing the Company's TSR relative to that of a pre-established peer group over the related \nthree-year\n performance period. Depending on the Company's level of achievement against its TSR performance goals, the number of shares that ultimately vest may range from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of the awards originally granted.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its TSR awards on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths of the Company's Class A common stock and that of its peer group to evaluate and determine its ultimate expected relative TSR performance ranking. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied.\nThe assumptions used to estimate the fair value of TSR awards granted were as follows: \n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\nExpected volatility\n36.7\n \n%\n38.4\n \n%\n49.9\n \n%\nExpected dividend yield\n2.0\n \n%\n2.5\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n3.9\n \n%\n4.6\n \n%\n3.1\n \n%\nWeighted-average grant date fair value\n$\n212.05\n$\n147.19\n$\n124.62\nA summary of performance-based RSU activity including TSR awards during Fiscal 2025 is as follows:\nPerformance-based\nRSUs\nNumber of\nShares\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\n \n(thousands)\nUnvested at March 30, 2024\n682\n \n$\n121.18\n \nGranted\n173\n \n182.12\n \nChange due to performance and/or market condition achievement\n72\n \n149.41\n \nVested\n(\n281\n)\n135.43\n \nForfeited\n(\n9\n)\n117.46\n \nUnvested at March 29, 2025\n637\n \n$\n134.69\n \nPerformance-based\nRSUs\nTotal unrecognized compensation expense at March 29, 2025 (millions)\n$\n29.5\n \nWeighted-average period expected to be recognized over (years)\n1.5\nF-45\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAdditional information pertaining to performance-based RSU activity including TSR awards is as follows:\n \nFiscal Years Ended\n \nMarch 29,\n2025\nMarch 30,\n2024\nApril 1,\n2023\nPerformance-based RSUs:\nWeighted-average grant date fair value of awards granted\n$\n182.12\n \n$\n129.38\n \n$\n106.58\n \nTotal fair value of awards vested (millions)\n$\n52.2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n26.8\n \n19.    \nEmployee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company sponsors defined contribution benefit plans covering substantially all eligible employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company makes matching contributions to the plans equal to \n50\n% of the first \n6\n% of salary contributed by an eligible employee. Additionally, the Company makes a supplemental matching contribution for plan years in which the Company achieves a \"target or above\" performance level based on certain goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year, increasing the matching contribution to between \n67\n% and \n100\n% depending on the performance level achieved, of the first \n6\n% of salary contributed by eligible employees, not to exceed the maximum contribution permitted by the plan.\nUnder the terms of the plans, a participant becomes 100% vested in the Company's matching contributions after \nfive years\n of credited service. Contributions made by the Company under these plans were $\n15.6\n million, $\n10.0\n million, and $\n8.3\n million in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively.\nInternational Defined Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors certain single-employer defined benefit plans and cash balance plans at international locations which are not considered to be material individually or in the aggregate to the Company's financial statements. Pension benefits under these plans are based on formulas that reflect the employees' years of service and compensation levels during their employment period. \nThe aggregate funded status of the single-employer defined benefit plans reflected net liabilities of $\n5.7\n million and $\n4.4\n million as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, respectively, and were primarily recorded within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These single-employer defined benefit plans had aggregate fair values of plan assets of $\n53.9\n million and aggregate projected benefit obligations of $\n59.6\n million as of March 29, 2025, compared to aggregate fair values of plan assets of $\n46.1\n million and aggregate projected benefit obligations of $\n50.5\n million as of March 30, 2024. The asset portfolio of the single-employer defined benefit plans primarily consists of fixed income and equity securities, which have been measured at fair value largely using Level 2 inputs, as described in Note 12. \nNet pension expense for these plans was $\n5.0\n million, $\n5.0\n million, and $\n3.9\n million in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively. The service cost component of $\n5.9\n million, $\n5.1\n million, and $\n4.2\n million in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2023, respectively, was recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. All other components of net pension expense during the fiscal years presented were recorded within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations.\nF-46\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n20.    \nSegment Information\nThe Company has \nthree\n reportable segments based on its business activities and organization:\n•\nNorth America\n — The North America segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear & accessories, home, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses primarily in the U.S. and Canada. In North America, the Company's retail business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its outlet stores, and its digital commerce sites, www.RalphLauren.com and www.RalphLauren.ca. The Company's wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and, to a lesser extent, specialty stores.\n•\nEurope\n — The Europe segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear & accessories, home, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Europe and emerging markets. In Europe, the Company's retail business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its outlet stores, its concession-based shop-within-shops, and its various digital commerce sites. The Company's wholesale business in Europe is comprised primarily of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital and licensee partners.\n•\nAsia\n — The Asia segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear & accessories, home, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company's retail business in Asia is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its outlet stores, its concession-based shop-within-shops, and its various digital commerce sites. In addition, the Company sells its products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. The Company's wholesale business in Asia is comprised primarily of sales to department stores and various third-party digital and licensee partners. \nNo operating segments were aggregated to form the Company's reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company also has other non-reportable segments, which primarily consist of Ralph Lauren and Chaps branded royalty revenues earned through its global licensing alliances.\nThe Company's segment reporting structure is consistent with how it establishes its overall business strategy, allocates resources, and assesses performance of its business. The accounting policies of the Company's segments are consistent with those described in Notes 2 and 3. Sales and transfers between segments are generally recorded at cost and treated as transfers of inventory. All intercompany revenues are eliminated in consolidation and are not reviewed when evaluating segment performance. The Company's CODM, who is its President and Chief Executive Officer, assesses segment performance and allocates resources based upon net revenues and operating income before restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other non-routine items, if any. In addition, the Company's CODM is regularly provided each segment's gross profit and total SG&A expenses, as well as SG&A expense by category at the consolidated level. Certain corporate overhead expenses related to global functions, most notably the Company's executive office, information technology, finance and accounting, human resources, and legal departments, largely remain at corporate. Additionally, other costs that cannot be allocated to the segments based on specific usage are also maintained at corporate, including corporate marketing and advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization of corporate assets, and other general and administrative expenses resulting from corporate-level activities and projects. Asset information by segment is not utilized by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance or allocating resources, and therefore such information has not been presented.\nF-47\nRALPH LAUREN

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 29, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 29, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May 22, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEnd-of-season Markdown Reserves\nDescription of the Matter\nAs disclosed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, estimates for end-of-season markdown reserves are based on historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. \nAuditing management's estimate of end-of-season markdown reserves was complex and judgmental as reserve amounts are sensitive to changes in market or economic conditions and have a direct, material impact on the amount of revenue recognized by the Company. There is also significant estimation required to establish markdown reserve rates by brand and customer, which are based on the Company's review of the seasonal negotiations with each customer and the expected performance of the products in the customers' stores. \nF-53\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's process to calculate the end-of-season markdown reserves, including the consideration of historical experience, actual and forecasted seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and contractual terms as applicable.\n \nTo test the estimate of end-of-season markdown reserves, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the assumptions regarding seasonal negotiations with each customer which include the application of market and economic conditions to individual customers and the expected performance of the products in the customers' stores that were used by the Company to calculate the projected markdown allowances to be issued upon settlement. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current market and economic trends, historical results and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to substantively test the changes in the estimate that would result from reasonable changes in the assumptions. \nEstimated Realizable Value of Inventory\nDescription of the Matter\nAs of March 29, 2025, the Company's net inventory balance was $\n949.6\n million. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the valuation of inventory requires management to make assumptions and judgments about the recoverability of inventory and its estimated realizable value.  \nThe estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends, market trends and economic conditions, future sales forecasts, on-hand inventory quantities, and consideration of the value of existing customer orders for future sales of inventory.  Given the importance of inventory to the Company's operations and the materiality of the balance, coupled with the judgment involved in estimating future sales, auditing management's estimated realizable value involved a higher extent of testing and the involvement of more senior members of the engagement team in executing, supervising and reviewing the results of the procedures. \nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process to determine the estimated realizable value of inventory, including controls over the inputs and assumptions used in management's calculation as described above. \nOur audit procedures to test the estimated realizable value of inventory included, among others, evaluating the appropriateness of management's inputs to the calculation, including testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in management's calculation such as historical sales activity and loss rates for each class of inventory, write-off activity, on-hand inventory levels and inventory aging. To evaluate management's ability to accurately estimate future sales projections, which is also a key factor in the determination of the reserve, we retrospectively reviewed actual sales compared to projections. We also tested the mathematical accuracy of the Company's calculation. \n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\nNew York, New York\nMay 22, 2025\nF-54\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Ralph Lauren Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ralph Lauren Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of March 29, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control \n—\n Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Ralph Lauren Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 29, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March 29, 2025 and March 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 29, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated May 22, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \nNew York, New York \nMay 22, 2025\nF-55"
