  "item1_summary": " Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to, and could be materially adversely affected by, various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below . We present these risk factors grouped by category, and the risks factors contained in each respective category are presented in order of their relative priority .\n Competition for skilled professionals remains intense, and employers are implementing new offerings to attract talent . Employers may be unable to retain their employees if they do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market . Some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services .\n Cybersecurity breaches of any of the systems we rely on may result from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks . The loss of our senior leaders or other key employees, or our inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition .\n sider error or threats, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions could expose us to unauthorized access, exfiltration, manipulation, corruption, loss or disclosure of proprietary, customer, employee or other data . A compromise may not manifest itself for months, or even years, and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner .\n The costs and operational consequences of enhancing system protections could rise significantly as threats increase . Any of these losses may not be insured against or fully covered through insurance we maintain . Any response could take substantial time, and there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable information . Such errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated .\n Our control over and ability to monitor the cybersecurity practices of our third-party vendors and service providers, and other third parties with whom we do business, remains limited . As these threats evolve, cybersecurity incidents will be more difficult to detect, defend against, mitigate and remediate . Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation .\n If we are unable to identify appropriate acquisition targets, or if our competitors are more successful in identifying acquisition targets at favorable valuations, we may fail to achieve desired strategic goals and capabilities . Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions would likely result in slower growth . Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, such as diversion of management’s attention; difficulties in integration of acquired operations and retention of employees .\n These new lines of business, technologies, products, and services may present us with additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed . External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a line of business .\n Our international operations may be subject to a number of risks, including: Political and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war) In the future, we intend to continue to consider additional international expansion opportunities . The occurrence of one or  one or two incidents could be the result of a change in regulatory requirements and laws .\n The internet is increasingly used to securely transmit benefits and related information to customers, operate our day-to-day activities . Maintaining, protecting and enhancing these capabilities to keep pace with evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences, requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources . Technology development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are completed .\n We use artificial intelligence (“AI”) and robotic processing automation in our business . We have internal policies governing the use of AI and RPA by our employees . These risks include the input or processing of confidential information, including material non-public information, in contravention of our policies or contractual restrictions to which any of the foregoing are subject .\n We are exposed to the risks associated with inaccuracies, errors and biases, along with the adverse impacts that such flawed models could have on our business and operations . governance and ethical issues relating to the use of AI or RPA may also result in reputational harm, liability and/or financial losses . The use of these technologies by our competitors may give them a competitive advantage .\n Our business is exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, extreme weather or other climate events . Natural disasters could also result in reduced underwriting capacity by insurance carriers, making it more difficult for us to place business . A significant portion of our businesses are concentrated in Florida, Michigan, California, Massachusetts, Georgia, and New York .\n We believe the current regulatory environment for insurance intermediaries in these states is no more restrictive than in other jurisdictions . The insurance business in the U.S. is primarily a state-regulated industry, and therefore, state legislatures may enact laws that adversely affect the insurance industry . We are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by hurricanes (particularly in Florida) and earthquakes (including in California, where we have 20 offices)\n Our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits . While we have disaster recovery procedures in place, they may not be effective . As we grow, including from integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture . Remote and hybrid work arrangements may also negatively impact our ability to maintain our culture .\n We derive significant revenue from commissions, but do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based . An extended period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a “soft” market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue . We could be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions .\n Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing our costs, including salary costs . Significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have negative effects on the global economy . If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services, our margins and profitability could decline . Any sustained inflation or significant increases in inflation could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition .\n We participate in captive insurance facilities for the purpose of facilitating additional underwriting capacity for our customers and to participate in underwriting results . While our underwriting risk through our participation in these facilities is limited, we may be subject to claims expenses associated with catastrophic weather events, such as those in the third quarter of 2022 associated with Hurricane Ian . Our results of operations may be negatively impacted if any of the facilities incur claims expenses .\n Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud . If any of these risks materialize, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected . We rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties to provide services to our business .\n A failure by the third parties to comply with service level agreements in a high quality and timely manner could result in economic, financial and/or reputational harm to us . Replacement of these service providers could create significant delay in services or operations . Some of these providers are located outside the U.S., exposing us to business disruptions and political risks .\n An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, non-compliance with legal, regulatory or contractual obligations, financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations . Certain of our shareholders have significant influence over (i) the election of our board of directors, (ii) the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring shareholder approval and (iii) our affairs and policies .\n Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws evolve and may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements . Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue . Law applies to transfers of information among affiliates, as well as to transactions we enter into with third-party vendors .\n We expect to be subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing AI and RPA, such as the EU AI Act, which was enacted in August 2024 . There is uncertainty regarding the scope of new laws and how existing laws will apply to AI . We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and contractual obligations to third parties related to privacy and information security .\n The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations or future enforcement actions could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business . Noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability . Disclosure of this information, or other security breach of our information systems, could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data .\n We will be subject to the risk that we, our employees and our agents may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations or policies, for which we might be held responsible . Actual or alleged violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm .\n The failure of an insurer with whom we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by our customers . Claimants may seek large damage awards, and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs, including punitive damages . Our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate .\n Insurance intermediary industry, including our practices and arrangements, are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various governmental authorities . Many of our offices are parties to agreements with certain insurance companies, including agreements providing for potential payment of revenue-sharing commissions by insurance companies based primarily on the overall profitability of the aggregate business written with those insurance companies .\n The primary purpose of such regulation and supervision is to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interests of our shareholders . As a result, such regulation could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing compliance costs, technology compliance, restricting the products or services we may sell, the markets we may enter, the methods and prices we may charge for our services .\n Certain federal financial services modernization legislation could lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry . State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners continually reexamine existing laws and regulations . Climate change issues become more prevalent, the U.S. and other governments are beginning to respond to these issues . This increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations, new or enhanced reporting, diligence or disclosure rules .\n There is increased and sometimes conflicting focus, including from governments, non-governmental organizations, regulators, investors and customers, on ESG issues such as environmental stewardship, climate change, diversity and inclusion, human rights, racial justice and workplace conduct . New regulations may impose additional compliance or disclosure obligations on us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition .\n Some investors have increased their emphasis on the ESG practices of companies across all industries . Perceptions of our efforts to achieve ESG goals or advance ESG-related strategies may differ widely among stakeholders . New government regulations could result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight, such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive in the European Union .\n Legislation concerning tort reform has been considered, from time to time, in the United States Congress and in several state legislatures . Failure to comply with material provisions of our covenants in these agreements could result in a default, rendering them unavailable to us and causing a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition .\n The failure of any lender under our revolving credit facility (which matures in 2026) could adversely affect our ability to borrow on that facility . Tightening conditions in the credit markets could negatively impact our  ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures . Our compliance with these covenants could limit management’s discretion in operating our business and could prevent us from engaging in certain potentially beneficial activities .\n The company's non-U.S. operations are conducted primarily in the local currencies of the respective countries in which we operate . Fluctuations in currency exchange rates that are unfavorable may have an adverse effect on our results of operations . The use of derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the company's hedging activities .\n A downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs, including those under our credit facility, and reduce our financial flexibility . Real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for, or trading value of, our securities . We may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes .\n If economic conditions were to worsen, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including declines in insurable exposure units, declines in insurance premium rates, the financial insolvency of insurance companies, or the reduced ability of customers to pay . Some of our customers may cease operations completely or be acquired by other companies, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations .\n Our results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage, which depends in turn on those insurance companies’ ability to procure reinsurance . Capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that we offer to our customers . We cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability .\n Customers’ demand for insurance products can influence the timing of renewals, new business and lost business . We rely on insurance companies for the payment of certain commissions . Because these payments are processed internally by these insurance companies, we may not receive a payment that is otherwise expected from a particular insurance company in a particular quarter or year until after that period .\n We have $8 billion of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet . We perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows . We have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves, which affects our ability to make profit-sharing calculations .\n There have been no impairments recorded to either goodwill or amortizable intangibles for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 . If determined that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, the appropriate adjustment would be recorded and could result in material charges that are adverse to our operating results and financial position .\n We base our estimates on historical experience and various forward assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances . We cannot predict the impact that future pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of infectious disease, will have in the future on our customers, insurance carriers, suppliers and other third-party contractors . Actual results could differ from these estimates .\n These and other disruptions related to pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of infectious disease could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . These events may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider as presenting significant risks to our operations .\n Audit Committee receives reports on at least a quarterly basis from the Company’s chief security officer on the latest information security risks and mitigation strategies . Board receives a report at least annually from the chief executive officer and chief legal officer concerning the Company's risks, which include cybersecurity risks . Audit Committee: \"All directors typically attend our committee meetings, which we believe creates transparency\"\n In 2024, nearly all Brown & Brown teammates completed ethical conduct training, cybersecurity awareness training, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Survey, and the Annual Certification for Insurance Licensees training . We have also established a structured incident response process driven by the severity and type of issue, which engages our security operations center (SOC)\n We have adopted an in-depth defense approach that includes intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems . To defray the costs of any future data breach, we have a cyber liability insurance policy . For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, see the risk factor entitled “A cybersecurity attack, or any other interruption in information technology and/or data security, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation ."
