In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items.\nTax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction \n58\nTable of \nContents\nin our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2024, our annual tax rate was 19.4% compared to 19.8% in 2023. See “Other Consolidated Results” for further information.\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. \nPension and Retiree Medical Plans\nOur pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.\nSee “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about changes and settlements within our pension plans.\nOur Assumptions\nThe determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.\nSignificant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:\n•\ncertain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;\n•\nthe expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans; and\n•\nthe spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities.\nCertain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.\nAt each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’ investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.\n59\nTable of \nContents\nWeighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\nPension\nService cost discount rate \n6.0\n \n%\n5.4 \n%\n5.5 \n%\nInterest cost discount rate \n5.4\n \n%\n5.1 \n%\n5.4 \n%\nExpected rate of return on plan assets \n7.1\n \n%\n7.0 \n%\n7.0 \n%\nRetiree medical\nService cost discount rate \n5.6\n \n%\n5.1 \n%\n5.4 \n%\nInterest cost discount rate \n5.2\n \n%\n5.0 \n%\n5.3 \n%\nExpected rate of return on plan assets \n7.1\n \n%\n7.1 \n%\n7.1 \n%\nIn 2024, the aggregate of lump sum distributions and the purchase of a group annuity contract exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered pre-tax settlement charges for certain U.S. defined pension plans. In addition, we expect the recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, partially offset by higher discount rates, to increase our pension and retiree medical expense in 2025.\nSensitivity of Assumptions\nA decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 100-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2025 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:\nAssumption\nAmount\nDiscount rates used in the calculation of expense\n$\n74 \nExpected rate of return\n$\n143 \nFunding\nWe make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.\nWe made a discretionary contribution of $250 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in January 2025.\nOur pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.\n60\nTable of \nContents\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nPepsiCo,

notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n66\nTable of \nContents\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 — \nBasis of Presentation and Our Divisions\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally \n50\n% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.\nRaw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from volatile geopolitical conditions and changes in the interest rate and inflationary cost environment have made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in a 53\nrd\n reporting week every five or six years, including in our 2022 financial results. While our North America financial results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, our international operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule: \nQuarter\nUnited States and Canada\nInternational\nFirst Quarter\n12 weeks\nJanuary and February\nSecond Quarter\n12 weeks\nMarch, April and May\nThird Quarter\n12 weeks\nJune, July and August\nFourth Quarter\n16 weeks (17 weeks for 2022)\nSeptember, October, November and December\nUnless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.\n67\nTable of \nContents\nOur Divisions\nWe are organized into \nseven\n reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:\n1)\nFrito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada;\n2)\nQuaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada;\n3)\nPepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;\n4)\nLatin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America;\n5)\nEurope, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe;\n6)\nAfrica, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and\n7)\nAsia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.\nChanges to Organizational Structure\nThe division amounts and discussions included in this Form 10-K reflect the reportable segments that existed through the end of 2024. Effective beginning with our first quarter of 2025, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with certain changes to our organizational structure and how the Chief Executive Officer will monitor the performance of these segments.\nIn North America, the food businesses, FLNA and QFNA, will be reported together as PepsiCo Foods North America. These changes do not impact our PBNA segment.\nInternationally, the foods businesses in LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC will be reorganized into three reportable segments: Latin America Foods, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Other International Foods. Other International Foods will include the foods businesses in APAC and India, currently part of AMESA.\nOur international franchise beverage businesses that were part of our LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC segments will be reported as International Beverages Franchise.\nThe company-owned bottling businesses operating internationally are all located within EMEA and will be reported in the newly created EMEA segment.\nOur historical segment reporting will be recast beginning first quarter 2025 to reflect the new organizational structure.\nThrough our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than \n200\n countries and territories with our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil.\nThe accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies:\n•\nshare-based compensation expense;\n•\npension and retiree medical expense; and\n•\nderivatives.\n68\nTable of \nContents\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nOur divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost. The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.\nPension and Retiree Medical Expense\nPension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses. \nDerivatives\nWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, metals, and energy. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes.\nNet Revenue, Significant Expenses and Operating Profit/(Loss) by Division\nOur chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM uses division operating profit/(loss) as the profit measure to evaluate division performance and allocate resources across divisions. Corporate unallocated expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income and net interest expense and other are centrally managed costs and are therefore excluded from this profit measure to provide better transparency of our division operating results. Our CODM considers variances of actual performance to our annual operating plan and periodic forecasts when making decisions. \nSignificant expenses are expenses which are regularly provided to the CODM and are included in division operating profit/(loss). These consist of segment cost of sales, segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and various items affecting comparability. Segment cost of sales includes raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, excluding the impact of items affecting comparability. Segment selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs to execute sales to customers, distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, costs related to brand and product marketing to consumers, other ongoing operating costs that are not directly related to manufacturing, distribution, selling, advertising or marketing activities as well as other income or expense items, excluding the impact of items affecting comparability. Items affecting comparability include restructuring and impairment charges, acquisition and divestiture-related charges, impairment and other charges/credits, product recall-related impact, indirect tax impact and gain associated with the Juice Transaction.\nAsset and other balance sheet information for divisions is not provided to the CODM. \n69\nTable of \nContents\nNet revenue, significant expenses and operating profit/(loss) of each division are as follows:\n \n2024\n \nFLNA\nQFNA\nPBNA\nLatAm\nEurope\nAMESA\nAPAC\nTotal\nNet revenue\n$\n24,755\n \n$\n2,676\n \n$\n27,769\n \n$\n11,718\n \n$\n13,874\n \n$\n6,217\n \n$\n4,845\n \n$\n91,854\n \nSegment cost of sales \n(a)\n8,786\n \n1,459\n \n12,701\n \n4,762\n \n7,219\n \n3,885\n \n2,431\n \nSegment selling, general and administrative expenses \n(a)(b)\n9,494\n \n710\n \n11,964\n \n4,442\n \n4,368\n \n1,515\n \n1,589\n \nRestructuring and impairment charges \n(c)\n150\n \n11\n \n238\n \n51\n \n123\n \n14\n \n10\n \nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges \n(d)\n9\n \n—\n \n8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n5\n \n—\n \nImpairment and other charges \n(e)\n—\n \n9\n \n556\n \n—\n \n145\n \n—\n \n4\n \nProduct recall-related impact \n(f)\n—\n \n184\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nIndirect tax impact \n(g)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n218\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDivision operating profit\n$\n6,316\n \n$\n303\n \n$\n2,302\n \n$\n2,245\n \n$\n2,019\n \n$\n798\n \n$\n811\n \n$\n14,794\n \nCorporate unallocated expenses\n(\n1,907\n)\nOperating profit\n12,887\n \nOther pension and retiree medical benefits expense\n(\n22\n)\nNet interest expense and other\n(\n919\n)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n11,946\n \n \n2023\n \nFLNA\nQFNA\nPBNA\nLatAm\nEurope\nAMESA\nAPAC\nTotal\nNet revenue\n$\n24,914\n \n$\n3,101\n \n$\n27,626\n \n$\n11,654\n \n$\n13,234\n \n$\n6,139\n \n$\n4,803\n \n$\n91,471\n \nSegment cost of sales \n(a)\n8,829\n \n1,603\n \n12,856\n \n4,958\n \n7,178\n \n3,888\n \n2,422\n \nSegment selling, general and administrative expenses \n(a)\n9,288\n \n870\n \n11,808\n \n4,413\n \n4,213\n \n1,434\n \n1,601\n \nRestructuring and impairment charges \n(c)\n42\n \n—\n \n41\n \n29\n \n223\n \n15\n \n8\n \nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges \n(d)\n—\n \n—\n \n16\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n2\n \n—\n \nImpairment and other charges/credits \n(e)\n—\n \n—\n \n321\n \n2\n \n855\n \n(\n7\n)\n59\n \nProduct recall-related impact \n(f)\n—\n \n136\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDivision operating profit\n$\n6,755\n \n$\n492\n \n$\n2,584\n \n$\n2,252\n \n$\n767\n \n$\n807\n \n$\n713\n \n$\n14,370\n \nCorporate unallocated expenses\n(\n2,384\n)\nOperating profit\n11,986\n \nOther pension and retiree medical benefits income\n250\n \nNet interest expense and other\n(\n819\n)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n11,417\n \n70\nTable of \nContents\n \n2022\n \nFLNA\nQFNA\nPBNA\nLatAm\nEurope\nAMESA\nAPAC\nTotal\nNet revenue\n$\n23,291\n \n$\n3,160\n \n$\n26,213\n \n$\n9,779\n \n$\n12,724\n \n$\n6,438\n \n$\n4,787\n \n$\n86,392\n \nSegment cost of sales \n(a)\n8,183\n \n1,673\n \n12,154\n \n4,490\n \n7,173\n \n4,108\n \n2,509\n \nSegment selling, general and administrative expenses \n(a)\n8,839\n \n876\n \n11,383\n \n3,559\n \n4,168\n \n1,459\n \n1,548\n \nRestructuring and impairment charges \n(c)\n46\n \n7\n \n68\n \n32\n \n109\n \n12\n \n16\n \nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges \n(d)\n—\n \n—\n \n51\n \n—\n \n14\n \n3\n \n—\n \nGain associated with the Juice Transaction \n(h)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n3,029\n)\n—\n \n(\n292\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nImpairment and other charges \n(e)\n88\n \n—\n \n160\n \n71\n \n2,932\n \n190\n \n177\n \nDivision operating profit/(loss)\n$\n6,135\n \n$\n604\n \n$\n5,426\n \n$\n1,627\n \n$\n(\n1,380\n)\n$\n666\n \n$\n537\n \n$\n13,615\n \nCorporate unallocated expenses\n(\n2,103\n)\nOperating profit\n11,512\n \nOther pension and retiree medical benefits income\n132\n \nNet interest expense and other\n(\n939\n)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n10,705\n \n(a)\nDoes not include items recorded in the cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses lines on our income statement that are presented in the restructuring and impairment charges, acquisition and divestiture-related charges, impairment and other charges/credits, product recall-related impact and indirect tax impact lines of these tables.\n(b)\nWe recognized a pre-tax gain of $\n122\n million ($\n92\n million after-tax or $\n0.07\n per share) in our FLNA division, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, related to the remeasurement of our previously held \n50\n% equity ownership in Sabra at fair value.

See Notes 2 and 4 for further information on goodwill and other intangible assets. See Notes 9 and 15 for further information on other assets.\n \nCorporate Unallocated Expenses\nCorporate unallocated expenses include costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives such as commodity derivative gains and losses, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our ongoing business transformation initiatives, unallocated research and development costs, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain gains and losses on equity investments, as well as certain other items.\nNote 2 — \nOur Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and \n74\nTable of \nContents\nadministrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition, we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions.\nThe transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that generally do not allow for a right of return, except in the instance of a product recall or other limited circumstances that may allow for product returns. Our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for product recall, anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc\nts.\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within \n30\n days of delivery in the United States, and generally within \n30\n to \n90\n days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.\nWe estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.\nWe are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. In 2024, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’s) represented approximately \n14\n% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart.\n \nTotal Marketplace Spending\nWe offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.\nA number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.\nThe terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $\n237\n million as of December 28, 2024 and $\n228\n million as of December 30, 2023 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our \nbalance sheet.\n75\nTable of \nContents\nFor interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology.\nAdvertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $\n5.9\n billion in 2024, $\n5.7\n billion in 2023 and $\n5.2\n billion in 2022, including advertising expenses of $\n3.9\n billion in 2024, $\n3.8\n billion in 2023 and $\n3.5\n billion in 2022. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:\n•\nmedia and personal service prepayments;\n•\npromotional materials in inventory; and\n•\nproduction costs of future media advertising.\nDeferred advertising costs of $\n58\n million and $\n67\n million as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.\nDistribution Costs\nDistribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $\n16.0\n billion in 2024, $\n15.4\n billion in 2023 and $\n15.0\n billion in 2022.\nSoftware Costs\nWe capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate \nfive\n to \n10\n years. Software amortization totaled $\n199\n million in 2024, $\n159\n million in 2023 and $\n123\n million in 2022. Net capitalized software and development costs were $\n1.5\n billion and $\n1.4\n billion as of December 28, 2024\n \nand\n \nDecember 30, 2023, respectively.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $\n813\n million, $\n804\n million and \n76\nTable of \nContents\n$\n771\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to volatile geopolitical conditions and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\nIn the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to volatile geopolitical conditions and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. \nAmortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. \nSee Note 4 for further information.\n \nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nOur other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows:\n•\nBasis of Presentation\n – Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation.\n•\nIncome Taxes\n – Note 5.\n•\nShare-Based Compensation –\n Note 6.\n•\nPension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans\n – Note 7.\n•\nFinancial Instruments\n – Note 9.\n•\nLeases\n – Note 12.\n•\nSupply Chain Financing Arrangements\n – \nNote 14\n.\n•\nCash Equivalents\n – Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\n77\nTable of \nContents\n•\nInventories \n– Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average; first-in, first-out (FIFO); or, in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods. For inventories valued under the LIFO method, the differences between the LIFO and FIFO methods of valuing inventories are not material.\n•\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n – Note 15. Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. Construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. \n•\nTranslation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries\n – Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \nAdopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to enhance disclosure of expenses of a public entity’s reportable segments. The new guidance requires a public entity to disclose on an annual and interim basis: (1) significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, (2) an amount for other segment items (the difference between segment revenue less the significant expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss), including a description of its composition, and (3) information about a reportable segment’s: (a) profit or loss, and (b) assets, if provided to CODM, and on an annual basis, the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources. The new guidance also clarifies that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss, one or more of those measures may be reported and requires that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in the guidance and all existing segment disclosures. We adopted the guidance in our 2024 annual reporting, on a retrospective basis. See Note 1 for further information.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued guidance to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs to allow financial statement users to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The new guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements include the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which we adopted in our 2024 annual reporting, on a prospective basis. See \nNote 14\n for further information.\nNot Yet Adopted\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance to improve the disclosure of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The new guidance requires a public entity to provide tabular disclosure, on an annual and interim basis, of amounts for the following expense categories: (1) purchases of inventory, (2) employee compensation, (3) depreciation and (4) intangible asset amortization, as included in each relevant expense caption. A relevant expense caption is an expense caption presented on the face of the income statement that contains any of the expense categories noted. Additionally, on an annual and interim basis, a qualitative description is required for amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. The guidance also requires certain amounts that are \n78\nTable of \nContents\ncurrently required to be disclosed to be included in the same tabular disclosure as these disaggregation requirements. Furthermore, on an annual and interim basis, a public entity is required to separately disclose selling expenses and annually, disclose a description of the selling expenses. The guidance is effective for 2027 annual reporting, and in the first quarter of 2028 for interim reporting, with early adoption permitted, to be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective, in our 2027 annual reporting and each quarter thereafter, on a prospective basis. \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to enhance transparency of income tax disclosures. On an annual basis, the new guidance requires a public entity to disclose: (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) additional information for reconciling items that are equal to or greater than 5% of the amount computed by multiplying income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) by the applicable statutory income tax rate, (3) income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes, with foreign taxes disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal to or greater than 5% of total income taxes paid, (4) income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign, and (5) income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated between federal (national), state and foreign. The guidance is effective for fiscal year 2025 annual reporting, with early adoption permitted, to be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective, in our 2025 annual reporting, on a prospective basis.\nNote 3 — \nRestructuring and Impairment Charges\n2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\nThe 2019 Productivity Plan leverages new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineers our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplifies our organization and optimizes our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we further expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2030 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $\n6.15\n billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $\n5.1\n billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $\n3.65\n billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $\n2.9\n billion.

Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next \nfive years\n, based on existing intangible assets as of December 28, 2024 and using average 2024 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nFive-year projected amortization\n$\n73\n \n$\n64\n \n$\n60\n \n$\n59\n \n$\n58\n \nDepreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAs discussed in Note 2, we perform our annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets during our third quarter. The annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets performed in the third quarter of 2024, based on best available market information and our internal forecasts and operating plans at the time, did not result in any material impairment charges.\nAs of December 28, 2024, the estimated fair value of the SodaStream reporting unit narrowly exceeded its carrying value. Given the low coverage, there could be further impairment to the carrying value of the SodaStream reporting unit goodwill if future sales and operating profit results are not in line with the forecasted future cash flows of the business and/or if macroeconomic conditions worsen and drive an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate its fair value. We continue to monitor the performance of the SodaStream reporting unit, as well as all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nWe did \nnot\n recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the year ended \nDecember 28, 2024\n.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, macroeconomic conditions, including higher interest rates, inflationary costs, and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, and recent business performance indicated a deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in various markets, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital and the impact of economic uncertainty on current and future financial performance, and required us to perform a quantitative assessment on certain assets. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value for certain of our intangible assets, which reflects the increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future sales and their contributions to operating profit and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions). As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $\n0.6\n billion ($\n0.5\n billion after-tax or $\n0.35\n per share) for brands and $\n0.3\n billion ($\n0.3\n billion after-tax or $\n0.22\n per share) for goodwill, both in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the SodaStream brand and reporting unit in our Europe division, in the year ended December 30, 2023. See Note 1 for further information.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $\n241\n million ($\n193\n million after-tax or $\n0.14\n per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information. \nIn the second quarter of 2022, macroeconomic factors, sanctions and other regulations as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict indicated a material deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia, primarily assumptions underlying the \n82\nTable of \nContents\nweighted-average cost of capital. These factors required us to perform a quantitative assessment, despite the absence of a material adverse impact on these assets’ financial performance (e.g., sales, operating profit, cash flows). The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, with the decrease in the fair value primarily attributable to a significant increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, which reflected the macroeconomic uncertainty in Russia. As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $\n1.2\n billion ($\n958\n million after-tax or $\n0.69\n per share) in impairment of intangible assets, related to our juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division, in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, macroeconomic conditions including a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, coupled with recent business performance, indicated a deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in various markets, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital and the impact of economic uncertainty on current and future financial performance, and required us to perform a quantitative assessment on certain assets. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, which reflected the increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future sales and their contributions to operating profit and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions).\n \nAs a result of the quantitative assessment, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $\n1.6\n billion ($\n1.3\n billion after-tax or $\n0.94\n per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the SodaStream brand in our Europe division, in the year ended December 31, 2022.

We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $\n579\n million in \n2024\n, and $\n309\n million in each of 2023 and 2022. We currently expect to pay approximately $\n772\n million of this liability in 2025.\nThe TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. We elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.\nOther Tax Matters\nOn October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of a final assessment from the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016 and requested an appeals conference. \nIn 2022, we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax benefit of $\n233\n million ($\n0.17\n per share) in 2022. Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues.\nIn 2024 and 2023, tax benefits of $\n54\n million ($\n0.04\n per share) and $\n68\n million ($\n0.05\n per share), respectively, were recorded related to the impairment of certain consolidated investments.\n85\nTable of \nContents\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following:\n2024\n2023\nDeferred tax liabilities\nDebt guarantee of wholly-owned subsidiary\n$\n578\n \n$\n578\n \nProperty, plant and equipment\n1,868\n \n1,978\n \nRecapture of net operating losses\n488\n \n492\n \nPension liabilities \n112\n \n167\n \nRight-of-use assets\n772\n \n660\n \nInvestment in TBG\n—\n \n93\n \nOther\n301\n \n350\n \nGross deferred tax liabilities\n4,119\n \n4,318\n \nDeferred tax assets\nNet carryforwards\n6,737\n \n6,877\n \nIntangible assets other than nondeductible goodwill\n1,599\n \n1,758\n \nShare-based compensation\n148\n \n137\n \nRetiree medical benefits\n104\n \n114\n \nOther employee-related benefits\n415\n \n412\n \nDeductible state tax and interest benefits\n202\n \n176\n \nLease liabilities\n773\n \n660\n \nCapitalized research and development\n256\n \n210\n \nOther\n948\n \n1,031\n \nGross deferred tax assets\n11,182\n \n11,375\n \nValuation allowances\n(\n6,185\n)\n(\n6,478\n)\nDeferred tax assets, net\n4,997\n \n4,897\n \nNet deferred tax (assets)/liabilities\n$\n(\n878\n)\n$\n(\n579\n)\nA summary of our valuation allowance activity is as follows: \n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance, beginning of year\n$\n6,478\n \n$\n5,013\n \n$\n4,628\n \n(Benefit)/provision\n(\n198\n)\n1,419\n \n492\n \nOther (deductions)/additions\n(\n95\n)\n46\n \n(\n107\n)\nBalance, end of year\n$\n6,185\n \n$\n6,478\n \n$\n5,013\n \n86\nTable of \nContents\nReserves\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. \nOur major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows:\nJurisdiction\nYears Open to Audit\nYears Currently Under Audit\nUnited States\n2014-2023\n2014-2019\nMexico\n2014-2023\n2014-2019\nUnited Kingdom\n2021-2023\nNone\nCanada (Domestic)\n2018-2023\n2019\nCanada (International)\n2012-2023\n2012-2019\nRussia\n2021-2023\nNone\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.\nAs of December 28, 2024, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $\n2.3\n billion. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $\n469\n million as of December 28, 2024, of which $\n103\n million of tax expense was recognized in 2024. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $\n390\n million as of December 30, 2023, of which $\n102\n million of tax expense was recognized in 2023.\nA reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n2024\n2023\nBalance, beginning of year\n$\n2,093\n \n$\n1,867\n \nAdditions for tax positions related to the current year\n210\n \n225\n \nAdditions for tax positions from prior years\n108\n \n123\n \nReductions for tax positions from prior years\n(\n46\n)\n(\n51\n)\nSettlement payments\n(\n24\n)\n(\n16\n)\nStatutes of limitations expiration\n(\n31\n)\n(\n33\n)\nTranslation and other\n(\n26\n)\n(\n22\n)\nBalance, end of year\n$\n2,284\n \n$\n2,093\n \nCarryforwards and Allowances\nOperating loss carryforwards and income tax credits totaling $\n34.0\n billion as of December 28, 2024 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses and income tax credits from prior periods to reduce future taxable income or income tax liabilities. These operating losses and income tax credits will expire as follows: $\n0.4\n billion in 2025, $\n29.1\n \n87\nTable of \nContents\nbillion between 2026 and 2041 and $\n4.5\n billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nUndistributed International Earnings\n \nAs of December 28, 2024, we had approximately $\n11\n billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $\n11\n billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\nNote 6 — \nShare-Based Compensation\nOur share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive \nfour\n stock options for every \none\n RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted \n66\n% PSUs and \n34\n% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets. \nThe Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs. \nAs of December 28, 2024, \n95\n million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.\nThe following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and excess tax benefits recognized:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nShare-based compensation expense - equity awards\n$\n362\n \n$\n380\n \n$\n343\n \nShare-based compensation expense - liability awards\n7\n \n19\n \n30\n \nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges\n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \nRestructuring charges\n(\n5\n)\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \nTotal\n$\n364\n \n$\n398\n \n$\n376\n \nIncome tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation\n$\n68\n \n$\n73\n \n$\n62\n \nExcess tax benefits related to share-based compensation\n$\n33\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n44\n \nAs of December 28, 2024, there was $\n398\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \ntwo years\n.\nMethod of Accounting and Our Assumptions\nThe fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily \nthree years\n. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no \n88\nTable of \nContents\nlonger required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. \nWe do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP.\n \nStock Options\nA stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a \n10\n-year term. \nOur weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nExpected life\n7\n years\n7\n years\n7\n years\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.2\n \n%\n4.2\n \n%\n1.9\n \n%\nExpected volatility\n16\n \n%\n16\n \n%\n16\n \n%\nExpected dividend yield\n2.9\n \n%\n2.7\n \n%\n2.5\n \n%\nThe expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price. \nA summary of our stock option activity for the year ended December 28, 2024 is as follows:\nOptions\n(a)\nWeighted-Average Exercise\nPrice Per Unit\nWeighted-Average Contractual\nLife Remaining\n(years)\nAggregate Intrinsic\nValue\n(a)\nOutstanding at December 30, 2023\n11,167\n \n$\n136.10\n \nGranted\n2,034\n \n$\n164.48\n \nExercised\n(\n1,555\n)\n$\n107.36\n \nForfeited/expired\n(\n591\n)\n$\n165.37\n \nOutstanding at December 28, 2024\n11,055\n \n$\n143.88\n \n6.16\n$\n177,780\n \nExercisable at December 28, 2024\n5,369\n \n$\n119.78\n \n3.98\n$\n177,780\n \nExpected to vest as of December 28, 2024\n5,403\n \n$\n166.64\n \n8.19\n$\n—\n \n(a)\nIn thousands.\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units\nEach RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCo’s performance against specified financial performance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with \n89\nTable of \nContents\nthe terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. \nA summary of our RSU and PSU activity for the year ended December 28, 2024 is as follows:\nRSUs/PSUs\n(a)\nWeighted-Average\nGrant-Date Fair Value Per Unit\nWeighted-Average Contractual Life\nRemaining (years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(a)\nOutstanding at December 30, 2023\n5,598\n \n$\n156.43\n \nGranted\n2,348\n \n$\n164.25\n \nConverted\n(\n2,055\n)\n$\n134.42\n \nForfeited\n(\n525\n)\n$\n165.96\n \nOutstanding at December 28, 2024 \n(b)\n5,366\n \n$\n166.09\n \n1.28\n$\n820,429\n \nExpected to vest as of December 28, 2024 \n(c)\n5,306\n \n$\n166.14\n \n1.20\n$\n811,310\n \n(a)\nIn thousands.

The settlement charge was triggered when the aggregate of the cumulative lump sum distributions and the annuity contract premium exceeded the total annual service and interest cost. \nEffective December 31, 2022, we merged two U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I), mostly inactive participants, and PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A, mostly active participants, with Plan I remaining. The accrued benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The merger was made to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses of the merged plan will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. There was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this merger.\nIn 2022, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of $\n145\n million and related assets to TBG in connection with the Juice Transaction. See Note 13 for further information.\nIn 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, effective December 31, 2025. \nGains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds \n10\n% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H) (approximately \n11\n years) and retiree medical (approximately \n11\n years), and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately \n26\n years).\nThe cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan H, and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the benefit accruals freeze effective December 31, 2025 is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze.\n92\nTable of \nContents\nSelected financial

operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year.\nThe amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:\n•\nInterest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. \n•\nExpected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations.\n•\nAmortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments. \n•\nAmortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience. \n•\nSettlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the total of annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are recognized when events such as plant closures, the sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).\n•\nSpecial termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring.\nThe components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows:\n \nPension\nRetiree Medical\n \nU.S.\nInternational\n \n \n \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nService cost\n$\n347\n \n$\n327\n \n$\n487\n \n$\n46\n \n$\n43\n \n$\n64\n \n$\n31\n \n$\n29\n \n$\n37\n \nOther pension and retiree medical benefits expense/(income):\nInterest cost\n$\n585\n \n$\n593\n \n$\n434\n \n$\n144\n \n$\n141\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n19\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n871\n)\n(\n851\n)\n(\n912\n)\n(\n205\n)\n(\n192\n)\n(\n218\n)\n(\n13\n)\n(\n13\n)\n(\n16\n)\nAmortization of prior service credits\n(\n24\n)\n(\n26\n)\n(\n28\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n5\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n8\n)\nAmortization of net losses/(gains)\n77\n \n70\n \n149\n \n21\n \n13\n \n29\n \n(\n25\n)\n(\n27\n)\n(\n14\n)\nSettlement/curtailment losses/(gains) \n(a)\n254\n \n4\n \n322\n \n22\n \n10\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n16\n)\nSpecial termination benefits\n31\n \n(\n1\n)\n37\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/(income)\n$\n52\n \n$\n(\n211\n)\n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n20\n)\n$\n(\n29\n)\n$\n(\n99\n)\n$\n(\n10\n)\n$\n(\n10\n)\n$\n(\n35\n)\nTotal\n$\n399\n \n$\n116\n \n$\n489\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n(\n35\n)\n$\n21\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n2\n \n(a)\nIn 2024, U.S. includes a settlement charge of $\n213\n million ($\n165\n million after-tax or $\n0.12\n per share) related to the aggregate of lump sum distributions and the purchase of a group annuity contract exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost.

In addition, in 2025, we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $\n102\n million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and contributions of approximately $\n52\n million for retiree medical benefits.\nWe also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.\nPlan Assets \nOur pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards. We also participate in securities lending programs to generate additional income by loaning plan assets to borrowers on a fully collateralized basis, including both cash and non-cash collaterals. \nFor 2025 and 2024, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is \n7.5\n% and \n7.4\n%, respectively. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows:\n2025\n2024\nFixed income\n56\n \n%\n55\n \n%\nU.S. equity\n22\n \n%\n22\n \n%\nInternational equity\n18\n \n%\n19\n \n%\nReal estate\n4\n \n%\n4\n \n%\nActual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.\nThe expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure \n96\nTable of \nContents\nthat they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a \nfive-year\n period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.\nPlan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2024 and 2023 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years and are as follows:\n \nFair Value Hierarchy Level\n2024\n2023\nU.S. plan assets \n(a)(b)\nEquity securities, including preferred stock \n(c)\n1\n$\n4,270\n \n$\n4,698\n \nGovernment securities \n(d)\n2\n1,538\n \n1,812\n \nCorporate bonds \n(d)\n2\n3,903\n \n4,233\n \nMortgage-backed securities \n(d)\n2\n125\n \n133\n \nContracts with insurance companies \n(e)\n3\n1\n \n1\n \nCash and cash equivalents \n(f) (g)\n1, 2\n732\n \n349\n \nSub-total U.S. plan assets\n10,569\n \n11,226\n \nReal estate and other commingled funds measured at net asset value \n(h)\n561\n \n411\n \nSecurities lending payables, net of dividends and interest receivable \n(g)\n(\n358\n)\n87\n \nTotal U.S. plan assets\n$\n10,772\n \n$\n11,724\n \nInternational plan assets\nEquity securities \n(c)\n1\n$\n1,172\n \n$\n1,175\n \nGovernment securities \n(d)\n2\n932\n \n1,207\n \nCorporate bonds \n(d)\n2\n469\n \n267\n \nFixed income commingled funds \n(i)\n1\n557\n \n526\n \nContracts with insurance companies \n(e)\n3\n29\n \n30\n \nCash and cash equivalents\n1\n128\n \n143\n \nSub-total international plan assets\n3,287\n \n3,348\n \nReal estate commingled funds measured at net asset value \n(h)\n79\n \n162\n \nDividends and interest receivable\n31\n \n18\n \nTotal international plan assets\n$\n3,397\n \n$\n3,528\n \n(a)\nIncludes $\n163\n million and $\n183\n million in \n2024\n and 2023, respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries.\n(b)\nIncludes securities loaned to borrowers under the securities lending program with fair value of $\n630\n million in 2024.\n(c)\nInvested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments.

The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PepsiCo, Inc. on a senior unsecured basis and may be assumed at any time by PepsiCo, Inc. as the primary and sole obligor.\nThe net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper.\nIn 2024, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 24, 2029. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $\n5.0\n billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $\n0.75\n billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $\n5.75\n billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, up to two times during the term of the 2024 Five-Year Credit Agreement, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $\n4.2\n billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of May 26, 2023.\nAlso in 2024, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 23, 2025. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $\n5.0\n billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $\n5.75\n billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $\n4.2\n billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of May 26, 2023.\nFunds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. \nSubject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 28, 2024, there were \nno\n outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.\nIn 2023, we discharged via legal defeasance $\n94\n million outstanding principal amount of certain notes originally issued by our subsidiary, The Quaker Oats Company, following the deposit of $\n102\n million of U.S. government securities with the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nIn 2022, we paid $\n750\n million to redeem all $\n750\n million outstanding principal amount of our \n2.25\n% senior notes due May 2022, we paid $\n800\n million to redeem all $\n800\n million outstanding principal amount \n99\nTable of \nContents\nof our \n3.10\n% senior notes due July 2022 and \nwe paid $\n154\n million to redeem all $\n133\n million outstanding principal amount of our subsidiary, Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc.’s \n7.00\n% senior notes due March 2029 and \n5.50\n% notes due May 2035.\nNote 9 — \nFinancial Instruments\nDerivatives and Hedging\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:\n•\ncommodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;\n•\nforeign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and\n•\ninterest rates.\nIn the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. \nWe do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. \nOur hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and non-derivative debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow and net investment hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings for cash flow hedges and when the hedged foreign operation is either sold or substantially liquidated for net investment hedges. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; there were \nno\n such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 28, 2024. \nCash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows associated with the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified within investing activities. \nCredit Risk\nWe perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.\nCertain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 28, 2024 was $\n208\n million. We have posted \nno\n collateral under these contracts and \nno\n credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 28, 2024.\n100\nTable of \nContents\nCommodity Prices\nWe are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than \ntwo years\n, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, metals, and energy. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\nInterest Rates\nWe centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense. These instruments effectively change the interest rate of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of our interest rate swap contracts match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and they have terms of no more than \nsix years\n. Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.\nAs of December 28, 2024, approximately \n13\n% of total debt was subject to variable rates, after the impact of the related interest rate swap contracts, compared to approximately \n9\n% as of December 30, 2023.\nForeign Exchange\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives including, but not limited to, forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. The forward contracts and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts have terms of no more than \ntwo years\n and \ntwelve years\n, respectively. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of our cross-currency interest rate swap contracts match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related foreign currency debt. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings. \nNet Investment Hedges\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in our foreign operations. We manage this risk for certain of our foreign operations by utilizing derivative and non-derivative instruments, including cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. \n101\nTable of \nContents\nIn 2024, we entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $\n500\n million for Chinese renminbi and maturity dates ranging from \nNovember 2025 to November 2029\n. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are designated as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign operations with Chinese renminbi functional currency. \nWe use the spot method to assess hedge effectiveness for our net investment hedges. Excluded components in the form of interest accruals on cross-currency interest rate swaps are recorded in net interest expense and other. \nThe notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 are as follows:\n \nNotional Amounts\n(a)\n2024\n2023\nCommodity contracts\n$\n1.4\n \n$\n1.7\n \nInterest rate swap contracts\n$\n2.0\n \n$\n—\n \nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n3.1\n \n$\n3.8\n \nCross-currency contracts\n$\n1.2\n \n$\n1.3\n \nNon-derivative debt instruments\n$\n2.9\n \n$\n3.0\n \n(a)\nIn billions.\nDebt Securities\nHeld-to-Maturity\nInvestments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of commercial paper. As of December 28, 2024, we have \nno\n investments in held-to-maturity debt securities. As of December 30, 2023, we had $\n309\n million investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. As of December 30, 2023, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were \nnot material\n.\nAvailable-for-Sale\nInvestments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected credit losses or impairment is recognized. We regularly evaluate our investment portfolio for expected credit losses and impairment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer, including the credit quality, and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a debt security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security.\nIn 2022, we entered into an agreement with Celsius Holdings, Inc. (Celsius) to distribute Celsius energy drinks in the United States and invested $\n550\n million in Series A convertible preferred shares issued by Celsius, which included certain conversion and redemption features. The preferred shares automatically convert into Celsius common shares after \nsix\n years if certain market-based conditions are met, or can be redeemed after \nseven\n years. Shares underlying the transaction were priced at $\n75\n per share, and the \n102\nTable of \nContents\npreferred shares are entitled to a \n5\n% annual dividend, payable either in cash or in-kind. Given our redemption right, we classified our investment in the convertible preferred stock as an available-for-sale debt security. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of this investment was classified as Level 2, based primarily on the transaction price. There were \nno\n unrealized gains and losses on our investment in the year ended December 31, 2022. In the year ended December 30, 2023, we transferred $\n558\n million from Level 2 to Level 3 as unobservable inputs to the fair value became more significant and subsequently recorded an unrealized gain of $\n612\n million in other comprehensive income and a decrease in the investment of $\n14\n million due to cash dividends received. In the year ended December 28, 2024\n, \nwe recorded an unrealized loss of $\n350\n million in other comprehensive income and a decrease in the investment of $\n21\n million due to cash dividends received.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 28, 2024, we transferred $\n184\n million of other available-for-sale debt securities from Level 2 to Level 3, as unobservable inputs to the fair value became more significant, and subsequently recorded an unrealized gain of $\n72\n million in other comprehensive income.\nThere were \nno\n impairment charges related to our investments in available-for-sale debt securities in the years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. There were net unrealized gains of $\n334\n million and $\n612\n million as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, associated with our available-for-sale debt securities.\nTBG Investment\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a \n39\n% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). See Note 13 for further information.\nIn 2023, we recorded our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings, which included an impairment of TBG’s indefinite-lived intangible assets, and recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment, both of which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of $\n321\n million ($\n243\n million after-tax or $\n0.18\n per share), recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our PBNA division. We estimated the fair value of our ownership in TBG using discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG, which we categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nIn 2024, after identifying several indicators of impairment such as worsening operating losses and liquidity position, we quantitatively assessed our investment in TBG for impairment and, consequently, recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our remaining investment, resulting in pre-tax impairment charges of $\n498\n million ($\n416\n million after-tax or $\n0.30\n per share), with $\n409\n million in our PBNA division and $\n89\n million in our Europe division, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. We estimated the fair value of our ownership in TBG using discounted cash flows. We also recorded an allowance for expected credit losses in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2024, primarily related to outstanding receivables associated with the Juice Transaction; see Note 1 for further information.\n103\nTable of \nContents\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 are categorized as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\n \nFair Value Hierarchy Levels\n(a)\nAssets\n(a)\nLiabilities\n(a)\nAssets\n(a)\nLiabilities\n(a)\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\n (b)\n3, 2\n$\n1,041\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,334\n \n$\n—\n \nIndex funds \n(c)\n1\n$\n336\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n292\n \n$\n—\n \nPrepaid forward contracts \n(d)\n2\n$\n15\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n—\n \nDeferred compensation \n(e)\n2\n$\n—\n \n$\n503\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n477\n \nDerivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments:\nInterest rate swap contracts \n(f)\n2\n$\n—\n \n$\n46\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts \n(g)\n2\n$\n55\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n31\n \nCross-currency contracts \n(g)\n2\n—\n \n165\n \n5\n \n135\n \nCommodity contracts \n(h)\n2\n27\n \n6\n \n10\n \n24\n \n$\n82\n \n$\n174\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n190\n \nDerivatives designated as net investment hedging instruments:\nCross-currency contracts \n(g)\n2\n$\n1\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts \n(g)\n2\n$\n28\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n33\n \n$\n38\n \nCommodity contracts \n(h)\n2\n3\n \n10\n \n5\n \n13\n \n$\n31\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n51\n \nTotal derivatives at fair value \n(i)\n$\n114\n \n$\n246\n \n$\n56\n \n$\n241\n \nTotal\n$\n1,506\n \n$\n749\n \n$\n1,695\n \n$\n718\n \n(a)\nFair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.\n(b)\nClassified as other assets. Includes Level 3 assets of $\n1,041\n million as of December 28, 2024, and Level 2 assets of $\n178\n million and Level 3 assets of $\n1,156\n million as of December 30, 2023. The fair value of our Level 3 investment in Celsius is estimated using probability-weighted discounted future cash flows based on a Monte Carlo simulation using significant unobservable inputs such as an \n80\n% probability that a certain market-based condition will be met and an average estimated discount rate of \n7.3\n% and \n8.1\n% as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, based on Celsius’ estimated synthetic credit rating. The fair value of the other Level 3 investment is estimated using a lattice model primarily based on the underlying stock price, volatility and certain significant unobservable inputs, such as a discount rate of \n8.3\n% as of December 28, 2024, based upon an estimated synthetic credit rating. An increase in the probability that certain market-based conditions will be met or a decrease in the discount rate would result in a higher fair value measurement, while a decrease in the probability that certain market-based conditions will be met or an increase in the discount rate would result in a lower fair value measurement. The fair value of our Level 2 investment as of December 30, 2023 approximates the transaction price and any accrued returns, as well as the amortized cost.\n(c)\nBased on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. \n(d)\nBased primarily on the price of our common stock. \n(e)\nBased on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections.\n(f)\nBased on Secured Overnight Financing Rate forward rates.

Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was \nnot material\n. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table.\nThe carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 was $\n40\n billion and $\n41\n billion, respectively, based upon prices of identical or similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.\nLosses/(gains) on our fair value hedges are categorized as follows:\nLosses/(Gains) Recognized in \nIncome Statement\n(a)\n2024\n2023\nInterest rate swap contracts\n$\n46\n \n$\n—\n \n(a)\nInterest rate derivative losses/(gains) are included in net interest expense and other.

We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to \n20\n years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to \nfive years\n and some of which include options to terminate the lease within \none year\n. We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nWe have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).\n108\nTable of \nContents\nComponents of lease cost are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating lease cost \n(a)\n$\n788\n \n$\n666\n \n$\n585\n \nVariable lease cost \n(b)\n$\n165\n \n$\n146\n \n$\n115\n \nShort-term lease cost \n(c)\n$\n566\n \n$\n582\n \n$\n510\n \n(a)\nIncludes right-of-use asset amortization of $\n655\n million, $\n570\n million, and $\n517\n million in \n2024\n, 2023, and 2022, respectively. \n(b)\nPrimarily related to adjustments for inflation, common-area maintenance and property tax. \n(c)\nNot recorded on our balance sheet.\nIn \n2024\n, 2023 and 2022, we recognized gains of $\n118\n million, $\n52\n million and $\n175\n million, respectively, on sale-leaseback transactions with terms generally under five years.\nSupplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating cash flow information:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\n$\n775\n \n$\n655\n \n$\n573\n \nNon-cash activity:\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations\n$\n1,218\n \n$\n1,088\n \n$\n871\n \nSupplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases is as follows:\nBalance Sheet Classification\n2024\n2023\nRight-of-use assets\nOther assets\n$\n3,383\n \n$\n2,905\n \nCurrent lease liabilities\nAccounts payable and other current liabilities\n$\n642\n \n$\n556\n \nNon-current lease liabilities\nOther liabilities\n$\n2,803\n \n$\n2,400\n \nWeighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term\n7\n years\n7\n years\n7\n years\nWeighted-average discount rate\n4\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n3\n \n%\nMaturities of lease liabilities by year for our operating leases are as follows:\n2025\n$\n770\n \n2026\n680\n \n2027\n579\n \n2028\n478\n \n2029\n377\n \n2030 and beyond\n1,129\n \nTotal lease payments\n4,013\n \nLess: Imputed interest\n568\n \nPresent value of lease liabilities\n$\n3,445\n \nFinance leases were not material as of December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nLessor\nWe have various arrangements for certain foodservice and vending equipment under which we are the lessor.

Upon consolidation, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $\n122\n million ($\n92\n million after-tax or $\n0.07\n per share) in our FLNA division, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, related to the remeasurement of our previously held \n50\n% equity ownership in Sabra at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, net of a control premium, and discounted cash flows.\nWe accounted for the acquisition as a business combination in the fourth quarter of 2024. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, in our FLNA division. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in this transaction as of the acquisition date primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets of $\n0.3\n billion and property, plant and equipment of $\n0.1\n billion. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to revision, which may result in adjustments to the preliminary values discussed above as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the fourth quarter of 2025.\nAcquisition of Siete\nOn January 17, 2025, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interest in Siete, a Mexican-American foods business, in a transaction valued at approximately $\n1.2\n billion. The total consideration transferred was approximately $\n1.2\n billion in cash. The purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the acquisition date.\nWe will account for the transaction as a business combination in the first quarter of 2025. We will recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Siete as of the acquisition date, which primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets, will be based on preliminary estimates that are subject to revisions and may result in adjustments to the preliminary values as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the first quarter of 2026.\nJuice Transaction\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately $\n3.5\n billion in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and a \n39\n% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. The North America portion of the transaction was completed on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion of the transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). \nAs a result of this transaction, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a gain in our PBNA and Europe divisions (see detailed income statement activity below), including $\n520\n million related to the remeasurement of our \n39\n% ownership in TBG at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flo\nws and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG\n. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we reached an agreement on final purchase price adjustments for net working \n110\nTable of \nContents\ncapital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement.\nA summary of income statement activity related to the Juice Transaction for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows:\nPBNA\nEurope\nCorporate\nTotal PepsiCo\nProvision for income taxes\n(a)\nNet income attributable to PepsiCo\nImpact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share\nGain associated with the Juice Transaction\n$\n(\n3,029\n)\n$\n(\n292\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n3,321\n)\n$\n433\n \n$\n(\n2,888\n)\n$\n2.08\n \nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges\n51\n \n14\n \n6\n \n71\n \n(\n13\n)\n58\n \n(\n0.04\n)\nOperating profit\n$\n(\n2,978\n)\n$\n(\n278\n)\n$\n6\n \n(\n3,250\n)\n420\n \n(\n2,830\n)\n2.04\n \nOther pension and retiree medical benefits income \n(b)\n(\n10\n)\n3\n \n(\n7\n)\n0.01\n \nTotal Juice Transaction\n$\n(\n3,260\n)\n$\n423\n \n$\n(\n2,837\n)\n$\n2.04\n \n(c)\n(a)\nIncludes $\n186\n million of deferred tax expense related to the recognition of our investment in TBG.\n(b)\nIncludes $\n16\n million curtailment gain, partially offset by $\n6\n million special termination benefits.\n(c)\nDoes not sum due to rounding.\nIn connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with PAI Partners, under which we provide certain services to TBG to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. In return for these services, TBG is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our costs without markup.\nThe Juice Transaction did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.\nIn the years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, we recognized \ni\nmpairment and other charges related to our TBG investment. See Notes 1 and 9 for further information.\nAcquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include transaction expenses, such as consulting, advisory and other professional fees, and merger and integration charges.

Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.\nA summary of our outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under the supplier finance program for the year ended December 28, 2024 is as follows:\n2024\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at beginning of year\n$\n1,655\n \nInvoices confirmed \n6,552\n \nConfirmed invoices paid \n(\n6,636\n)\nTranslation and other\n(\n93\n)\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at end of year\n$\n1,478\n \n112\nTable of \nContents\nNote 15 — \nSupplemental Financial Information\nBalance Sheet\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAccounts and notes receivable\n \nTrade receivables\n$\n8,487\n \n$\n8,675\n \nOther receivables\n2,202\n \n2,315\n \nTotal\n10,689\n \n10,990\n \nAllowance, beginning of year\n175\n \n150\n \n$\n147\n \nNet amounts charged to expense \n(a)\n228\n \n55\n \n21\n \nDeductions\n \n(\n36\n)\n(\n26\n)\n(\n12\n)\nTranslation and other\n(\n11\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n6\n)\nAllowance, end of year\n356\n \n175\n \n$\n150\n \nAccounts and notes receivable, net\n$\n10,333\n \n$\n10,815\n \nProperty, plant and equipment, net\nAverage\nUseful Life (Years)\nLand \n$\n1,136\n \n$\n1,159\n \nBuildings and improvements\n15\n - \n44\n11,938\n \n11,579\n \nMachinery and equipment, including fleet and software\n5\n - \n15\n36,990\n \n36,006\n \nConstruction in progress\n5,941\n \n5,695\n \n56,005\n \n54,439\n \nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n27,997\n)\n(\n27,400\n)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net \n$\n28,008\n \n$\n27,039\n \nDepreciation expense\n$\n2,945\n \n$\n2,714\n \n$\n2,523\n \nOther assets\nNoncurrent notes and accounts receivable\n$\n111\n \n$\n200\n \nDeferred marketplace spending\n100\n \n103\n \nPension plans \n(b)\n1,190\n \n1,057\n \nRight-of-use assets \n(c)\n3,383\n \n2,905\n \nOther investments \n(d)\n1,346\n \n1,616\n \nOther\n821\n \n780\n \nTotal\n$\n6,951\n \n$\n6,661\n \nAccounts payable and other current liabilities\nAccounts payable \n(e)\n$\n10,997\n \n$\n11,635\n \nAccrued marketplace spending\n3,458\n \n3,523\n \nAccrued compensation and benefits\n2,256\n \n2,687\n \nDividends payable\n1,885\n \n1,767\n \nCurrent lease liabilities \n642\n \n556\n \nOther current liabilities\n \n5,216\n \n4,969\n \nTotal\n$\n24,454\n \n$\n25,137\n \n(a)\nIncrease primarily reflects an allowance for expected credit losses related to outstanding receivables from TBG associated with the Juice Transaction; see Note 1 for further information.\n(b)\nSee Note 7 for further information.\n(c)\nSee Note 12 for further information.\n(d)\nIncludes our investment in Celsius convertible preferred stock.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024 based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n115\nTable of \nContents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \nUnrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 28, 2024, the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $2.3 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court rulings or tax authority settlements.\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’s settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax returns in light of new information.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’s settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority \n116\nTable of \nContents\nsettlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company’s tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company’s interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements.\n/s/ \nKPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1990.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 3, 2025\n117\nTable of \nContents\nGLOSSARY\nAcquisitions and divestitures\n: mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler Case Sales (BCS)\n: measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers. \nBottler funding\n: financial incentives we give to our independent bottlers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our beverage products.\nChief Operating Decision Maker (CODM)\n: our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nConcentrate Shipments and Equivalents (CSE)\n: measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency\n: financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period.

These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During 2024, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue\n \nto migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with our 2019 multi-year \n120\nTable of \nContents\nproductivity plan and resulting organization and business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nExcept with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan.\nItem 9B.
