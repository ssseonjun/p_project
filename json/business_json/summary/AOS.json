  "item1_summary": " The risks set forth below are not an exhaustive list of potential risks but reflect those that we believe to be material . If any of the events contemplated by the following risks were to actually occur, then our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected . The trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment .\n Tariffs, taxes, customs duties and other trading regulations imposed by the U.S. could significantly increase the prices we pay for raw materials that are critical to our ability to manufacture our products . A deterioration in economic conditions also could negatively impact our vendors and customers, which could result in an increase in bad debt expense, customer and vendor bankruptcies, interruption in supply of materials, or increased material prices .\n The occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including natural disasters, political disruptions, terrorist attacks, public health issues, and acts of war, could significantly disrupt production, or impact consumer spending . New or increased tariffs could also negatively affect U.S. national or regional economies, which could negatively affect demand for our products .\n There is still the potential for natural disasters and extreme weather conditions to disrupt the productivity of our facilities . Consumer preferences for products and the methods in which they purchase products are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, performance, convenience, availability of government incentives, environmental and social concerns and perceptions . As consumer confidence changes, purchasing behavior may shift the product mix to lower priced models in the markets in which we participate or result in a shift to other distribution channels .\n It is possible that we will not be able to develop new technologies, products or distribution channels, or do so on a timely basis, to align with consumer purchasing behavior and consumer preferences . The market prices for certain materials and components we purchase, primarily steel, can be volatile. In recent years, we have also experienced inflation-related increases in our transportation and other costs .\n We compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design, reliability, quality of products and services, advanced technologies, product performance, maintenance costs and price . New technologies and new competitors have developed and continue to develop in certain markets in which we participate . Failure to adapt to the evolving competitive environment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows .\n 32 percent of our sales in 2024 were attributable to products sold outside of the U.S., primarily in China and Canada, and to a lesser extent in Europe and India . Further deterioration in the Chinese economy may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . Approximately 5,000 of our 12,700 employees as of December 31, 2024 were located in China .\n Sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 42 percent of our sales in 2024 . We expect that our customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future . Changes in the political, regulatory, or trade climate, diplomatic relations, or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows .\n A portion of our business could be adversely affected by a decline in North American new residential or commercial construction . Failure to successfully develop relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows . We believe that the significant majority of the markets we serve are for the replacement of existing products .\n Information systems are susceptible to outages due to system failures, cybersecurity threats, failures on the part of third-party information system providers . Remote work and remote access to our systems have increased in recent years, which may heighten these risks . Use of artificial intelligence software may also create risks from unintentional disclosure of proprietary, confidential, personal or otherwise sensitive information .\n Our international operations are subject to risks related to foreign currencies . An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of our foreign markets, particularly in China, has negatively affected our sales, profitability, and cash and cash equivalents balances . A successful attack in the future could result in operations failure or breach of security that could lead to disruptions of business activities .\n The majority of our foreign currency transaction risk results from sales of our products in Canada, a portion of which we manufacture in the U.S., and to a lesser extent from component purchases in Europe and India and payroll in Mexico . Currency translation risks may adversely impact our reported sales and profits in the future . Product defects can occur through our own product development, design and manufacturing processes .\n We could use a significant portion of our available capital to fund future acquisitions . We may not be able to successfully integrate future acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions . Changes in regulations or standards, such as those associated with climate change, could adversely affect our business . The impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows .\n We believe our products are currently efficient, safe and environment-friendly . A significant change to regulatory or code requirements that promotes a transition to alternative energy sources as a replacement for gas, or a significant shift in industry standards, could substantially increase manufacturing costs, capital expenditures, transportation costs and raw material costs . Violations of these laws may result in criminal penalties or sanctions .\n Our inability to achieve sustainability commitments could have an adverse impact on our reputation and performance . Failure to meet these sustainability requirements or targets could adversely impact our reputation as well as the demand for our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations . Our products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products .\n An impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets could cause a decline in our net worth . We self-insure a portion of product liability claims . A series of successful claims against us could adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition . A significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill may affect our ability to maintain the debt-to-capital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements .\n Certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit (Smith Family) have entered into a voting trust agreement . As of December 31, 2024, through the voting trust, these members of Smith Family own approximately 66.8 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, taken together as a single class .\n The Smith Family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the Smith Family decide to transfer their shares . The trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Common Stock proposed to be withdrawn from the trust .\n Our CIO and ISD are supported by a cross-functional team of professionals with broad experience and expertise in threat assessment and detection, mitigation technologies, training, incident response, and regulatory compliance . The full Board of Directors receives an update on our cyber risk management process and trends related to cybersecurity at least annually, or real-time if a material event occurs .\n The company has a robust cybersecurity program to assess, identify and manage material risk from cybersecurity threats . The program is guided by cybersecurity frameworks, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), although we also look to other standards to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business .\n To-date, none of these cybersecurity incidents have materially affected the Company or our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows . We continue to invest in cybersecurity and the resiliency of our networks, including our controls and processes, all of which are designed in an effort to protect IT systems and infrastructure, and the information they contain ."
