In November 2022, we further increased our target for use of recycled materials to 30% by 2030 .

Areas of competition include service, sustainability, innovation, quality, and price . The company did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales in the last three fiscal years . We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices .\n Supply shortages, along with other factors, can lead to increased raw material price volatility . Increases in the price of raw materials are generally able to be passed on to customers including through contractual price mechanisms over time . We manage risks associated with our supply chain and have generally been able to maintain adequate raw materials through relationship management, inventory management, and evaluation of alternative sources when practical ."
