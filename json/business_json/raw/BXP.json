  "item1_text": "Item 1A—Risk Factors,” \ninclude additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance.  Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.  New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  Investors should also refer to our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and Current Reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Current Reports on Form 8-K or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.  We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements after the date of this report.\nOverview\nBXP is one of the largest publicly traded office real estate investment trusts (REITs) (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2024) in the United States that develops, owns, and manages primarily premier workplaces.  Our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets in the U.S. - Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.  BPLP is the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of its assets.  We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing premier workplaces to our clients.  When making leasing decisions, we consider, among other things, the creditworthiness of the client and the industry in which it conducts business, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the amount of any security deposit or letter of credit posted by the client, the costs of tenant improvement allowances, free rent periods and other landlord concessions, anticipated operating expenses and real estate taxes, the date by which we expect to begin revenue recognition for the lease under GAAP, current and anticipated vacancy in our properties and the market overall (including sublease space), current and expected future demand for the space, the impact of other clients’ expansion rights and general economic factors.\nWe believe our key competitive advantages are our commitment to the office asset class and to our clients as many competitors have divested in the sector, a strong balance sheet with access to capital in the secured and unsecured debt markets and the private and public equity markets, and one of the highest quality portfolios of \n53\nTable of Contents\n     \npremier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional development, acquisitions and dispositions.  Clients and their advisors are increasingly focused on these attributes for their building owners, which distinguishes BXP among its competitors.\nWe consider premier workplaces to be well-located buildings that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings, are professionally managed and maintained, and offer a number and type of amenities that are in high demand by clients that are focused on the importance of the physical work environment in recruiting and retaining the best and brightest employees.  As such, these properties attract creditworthy clients and command upper-tier rental rates in their markets.  We do not consider the expression “premier workplaces” a classification of our properties in accordance with any standard listing criteria in the real estate industry.  We therefore caution investors that our use and definition of “premier workplaces” may be different than the use and definition of similar expressions and traditional classifications that may be used by other companies.\nOur core strategy has always been to develop, acquire and manage premier workplaces in gateway markets with high barriers-to-entry and attractive demand drivers and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong clients that are diverse across market sectors.  We believe this strategy provides a competitive advantage that helps BXP distinguish itself from competitors as our clients are interested in leasing space in vibrant, amenitized and accessible premier workplaces to encourage more in-person work.  This interest has accelerated the flight to quality in the office industry.  Over the past several years, BXP’s experience and performance has diverged from the larger market and media sentiment, as premier workplaces have outperformed the broader office market consistently and substantially in both rental rates achieved and occupancy.  We believe this divergence validates our strategy and differentiates BXP from other office companies.  \nPremier workplaces in our five traditional central business district (“CBD”) markets (Boston, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC) have consistently outperformed the broader office market in those CBDs on several key metrics, including occupancy, net absorption levels, rental rates and landlord concessions.  This outperformance is evident in BXP’s portfolio where we derive approximately 88% of our share of annualized rental obligations from predominantly premier workplaces located in CBDs.  We define annualized rental obligations as the monthly contractual base rent (excluding percentage rent and rent abatements) and budgeted reimbursements from clients under existing leases as of December 31, 2024, multiplied by twelve.  Our share of annualized rental obligations is calculated as the consolidated amount, plus our share of the amount from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based on our economic percentage ownership interest), less our partners’ share of the amount from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based on the partners’ economic percentage ownership interest).  As of December 31, 2024, these CBD assets are 90.9% occupied and 92.8% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)).\nAs of December 31, 2024, the weighted-average remaining lease term for (1) our in-place leases, based on square feet, including those signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding residential units, was approximately 7.8 years, and (2) our 20 largest clients, based on square feet, was approximately 9.4 years.\nOutlook\nThe important market forces impacting BXP continue to be corporate earnings growth, return-to-office behavior, limited new development starts and the outperformance of premier workplaces, all of which are currently serving as tailwinds to BXP’s performance.  Interest rates also remain a critical factor but are on a more uncertain trajectory.  Inflation rose in the last three months of 2024 to 2.9%, remaining above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, and the December 2024 employment data indicated new job creation exceeded market expectations.  As a result, the Federal Reserve has become more cautious, lowering its forecast of Federal funds rate cuts in 2025.  In the fixed income markets, long-term interest rates have increased approximately 100 basis points since the Federal Reserve's first rate cut in September 2024.  Notwithstanding these uncertainties, we expect short-term interest rates to remain lower in 2025 compared to 2024, which would be a positive for both BXP and our clients' cost of capital. \nThough we are in the early stages of the new presidential administration, we believe many of the initial articulated policies are generally business friendly, particularly lower taxes and less regulation, which could build the confidence of our clients and, as a result, potentially stimulate leasing activities.\nAn area of concern with the new presidential administration's policies is the potential impact to interest rates, given that new tariffs, if implemented, could be inflationary and tax cuts without corresponding spending cuts could lead to longer fiscal deficits and higher long-term treasury yields in the debt markets.\n54\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe evolving operating environment impacts various aspects of our operating activities as:\n•\nlabor market conditions shift, which has gradually increased employer demand for mandatory in-person workdays;\n•\nprivate market debt financing, both for construction and existing assets, continues to be challenging to arrange despite broader market improvements as lenders remain focused on top-tier sponsorship and derisked financing opportunities; and\n•\nconstruction costs have increased and, although much of the cost for our active development pipeline is fixed, the cost of potential future construction activity continues to increase.\nIn light of the uncertain trajectory of the U.S. and global economies, we continue to position BXP for success by ensuring ample liquidity, managing our leverage, pursuing additional capital raising opportunities and maintaining discipline in discretionary capital expenditures, while continuing to selectively invest (including through both acquisitions and developments) in premier workplace opportunities.\n \nWe remain focused on:\n•\ncontinuing to embrace our leadership position in the premier workplace segment and leveraging our strength in portfolio quality, client relationships, development skills, market penetration and sustainability to profitably build market share;\n•\nleasing available space in our in-service and development properties, as well as proactively focusing on future lease expirations;\n•\ncompleting the construction and leasing of our development properties;\n•\npursuing attractive asset class adjacencies where we have a track record of success, such as residential development;\n•\ncontinuing to enhance the overall quality of our portfolio and actively recycling capital by selling assets, subject to market conditions, that we believe no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market;\n•\nactively managing our operations in a sustainable and responsible manner; and\n•\nprioritizing risk management by actively managing liquidity, investing more extensively with joint venture partners to manage our debt levels, and being highly selective in new investment commitments.\nThe following is an overview of leasing and investment activity in the fourth quarter of 2024 and recent business highlights.\nLeasing Activity and Occupancy\nTo be successful in any leasing environment, we believe we must consider all aspects of the client-landlord relationship.  In this regard, we believe that our competitive leasing advantage is based on the following attributes:\n•\nour understanding of our client’s short- and long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets;\n•\nour track record of developing and operating premier workplaces in a sustainable and responsible manner; \n•\nour reputation as a high-quality developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in our markets;\n•\nour financial strength, including our ability to fund our share of lease obligations and maintain premier building standards; and\n•\nour relationships with local brokers.\nOverall, we believe that our operating environment is improving.  Although all the markets in which we operate still need consistent incremental absorption to constitute a macro recovery, we have started to see pockets of strength where low availability is driving constructive client behavior, particularly in New York and Boston which accounts for 61% of our share of annualized rental obligations.  As clients choose premier workplaces in sound financial condition, with building owners that are committed for the long term to their properties operated by the best property management teams, we expect to continue to be successful in gaining market share.  \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we executed 83 leases totaling more than 2.3 million square feet with a weighted-average lease term of approximately 10.3 years.  This result represents BXP’s strongest leasing quarter since the second quarter of 2019, and the amount leased is approximately 130% of our historical 10-year average for the \n55\nTable of Contents\n     \nfourth quarter.  For full year 2024, we executed 291 leases totaling approximately 5.6 million square feet with a weighted-average lease term of 9.8 years.\nAt December 31, 2024, BXP’s CBD portfolio was 90.9% occupied and 92.8% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).  Approximately 88% of our share of annualized rental obligations comes from assets located in our CBD portfolio, underscoring the strength of BXP’s strategy to invest in the highest quality buildings in dynamic urban gateway markets.\nAt December 31, 2024, the overall occupancy of our in-service office and retail properties was 87.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from September 30, 2024.  We define occupancy as space with signed leases for which revenue recognition has commenced in accordance with GAAP.  Including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced revenue recognition in accordance with GAAP, our in-service office and retail properties were approximately 89.4% leased at December 31, 2024.\nInvestment Activity\nWe remain in active pursuit of opportunities in our core markets and asset types with primarily two types of counterparties: lenders to highly leveraged assets that require recapitalization and institutional owners seeking to divest from the office asset class.  To date, there has been limited market transaction activity for higher-quality office assets, though owners are increasingly testing the market to understand pricing.  \nWe continually evaluate current and prospective markets for possible acquisitions of “value-add” assets that require lease-up or repositioning, and acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our long-term strategy of owning, managing, developing, and improving premier workplaces in each of our chosen markets.  Additional new acquisition opportunities will likely increase in this environment, and we remain committed to developing and acquiring assets to enhance our long-term growth and to meet client demand by focusing on premier workplaces.  \nConsistent with this strategy, on December 27, 2024, we completed the acquisition of 725 12th Street, an approximately 300,000 square foot, 12-story property in Washington, DC, for a purchase price, excluding transaction costs, of $34.0 million.  We will be redeveloping the property into an approximately 320,000 square foot premier workplace.  In conjunction with the closing, we signed a lease agreement with global law firm, McDermott Will & Emery LLP, covering approximately 152,000 square feet in the top five floors of the “to-be-constructed” premier workplace.  We are currently negotiating with a client for the majority of the remaining space, although there is no guarantee we will lease such space on the terms contemplated or at all.  Ideally located in the CBD of Washington, DC, the property sits three blocks from the White House and steps from Metro Center Station, the transportation hub for the City’s Metrorail service, where the Red, Orange, Blue, and Silver lines converge.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our development/redevelopment pipeline consisted of seven properties that, when completed, we expect will total approximately 2.3 million net rentable square feet.  Our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion remains to be invested.  The commercial space in the pipeline, which excludes the residential project, was 50% pre-leased as of February 21, 2025.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we completed and fully placed in-service 300 Binney Street, an approximately 240,000 square foot laboratory/life sciences project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in which BXP has a 55% ownership interest.  This project is 100% leased to the Broad Institute.\nAs we continue to focus on new investments to drive future growth, we regularly review our portfolio to identify properties as potential sales candidates that either no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market.  In addition, the BXP regional teams are pursuing alternative uses for some of our suburban land holdings, which includes vacant office buildings for which the highest and best use may not be office. \nWe are currently in active negotiations for the disposition of three land sites and we expect to put an operating property into the market for sale in 2025.  If successful, these sales in aggregate could generate approximately $200.0 million of net proceeds in 2025, although it is possible that one of the land sales does not close until 2026.  However, there can be no assurance that we will complete any of these transactions on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.\nA brief overview of each of our markets follows.\n56\nTable of Contents\n     \nBoston\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we executed approximately 682,000 square feet of leases and approximately 430,000 square feet of leases commenced in the Boston region.  Approximately 146,000 square feet of the leases that commenced had been vacant for less than one year and represent a decrease in net rental obligations of approximately 0.3% over the prior leases.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, our approximately 8.4 million square foot Boston CBD in-service portfolio was approximately 95.6% occupied and approximately 97.5% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).\nOur approximately 2.7 million square foot in-service CBD portfolio in Cambridge was approximately 96.6% occupied and 97.6% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP) as of December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our approximately 4.8 millions square foot Route 128-Mass Turnpike in-service portfolio was approximately 75.6% occupied and approximately 77.7% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).\nLos Angeles\nOur Los Angeles (“LA”) in-service portfolio of approximately 2.3 million square feet is currently focused in West LA and includes Colorado Center, an approximately 1.1 million square foot property of which we own 50%, and Santa Monica Business Park, a 21-building, approximately 1.2 million square foot property.  As of December 31, 2024, our LA in-service properties were approximately 84.9% occupied and 87.4% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).   \nNew York\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we executed approximately 574,000 square feet of leases in the New York region and approximately 575,000 square feet of leases commenced.  Approximately 199,000 square feet of the leases that commenced had been vacant for less than one year, and they represent a decrease in net rental obligations of approximately 5.9% over the prior leases.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, our New York CBD in-service portfolio was approximately 90.8% occupied and approximately 93.6% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).   \nSan Francisco\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we executed leases for approximately 383,000 square feet and approximately 106,000 square feet commenced in the San Francisco region.  Approximately 56,000 square feet of leases that commenced had been vacant for less than one year and represent an increase in net rental obligations of approximately 13.2% over the prior leases.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our San Francisco CBD in-service properties were approximately 84.3% occupied and approximately 85.2% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).  \nSeattle\nOur Seattle in-service portfolio includes Safeco Plaza, an approximately 762,000 square foot property of which we own 33.67%, and Madison Centre, an approximately 755,000 square foot property.  As of December 31, 2024, these in-service properties were approximately 81.6% occupied and approximately 83.5% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).  \nWashington, DC \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we executed leases for approximately 494,000 square feet and leases for approximately 140,000 square feet commenced in the Washington, DC region.  Leases for approximately 64,000 square feet that commenced had been vacant for less than one year and represent a decrease in net rental obligations of approximately 11.6% over the prior leases.  \n57\nTable of Contents\n     \nAs of December 31, 2024, our Washington, DC CBD in-service properties were approximately 89.2% occupied and approximately 90.7% leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP). \nA significant component of our Washington, DC regional portfolio is in Reston Town Center, an award-winning mixed-use development in Northern Virginia.  Reston is a hub for technology, cloud services, cybersecurity and defense intelligence companies.  As of December 31, 2024, our approximately 4.9 million square foot Reston CBD portfolio was approximately 94.9% occupied and approximately 96.9% leased (including vacant space for which have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP).\nIn regard to the new presidential administration’s efficiency initiatives, if the federal workforce returns to their offices, their return should be a significant positive for our business in the Washington, DC region.  More street life would be a positive for the urban environment, hopefully triggering government contractor clients to return to their offices in line with government clients.  In addition, if the General Services Administration (“GSA”) reduces space requirements, we do not expect to be directly or materially impacted by this reduction as we have limited exposure to GSA leases. \nLeasing Statistics\nThe table below details our vacancy and the leasing activity, including 100% of the unconsolidated joint ventures, that commenced revenue recognition during the year ended December 31, 2024:\nYear ended December 31, 2024\n(Square Feet)\nVacant space available at the beginning of the period\n5,696,007 \nVacant space from property dispositions/properties taken out of service (1)\n(580,232)\nVacant space from properties placed (and partially placed) in-service (2)\n831,121 \nLeases expiring or terminated during the period\n4,952,232 \nTotal space available for lease\n10,899,128 \n1\nst\n generation leases \n754,932 \n2\nnd\n generation leases with new clients\n1,965,698 \n2\nnd\n generation lease renewals\n2,056,424 \nTotal space leased (3)\n4,777,054 \nVacant space available for lease at the end of the period\n6,122,074 \nLeases executed during the period (4)\n5,648,615 \nSecond generation leasing information\n: (5)\nLeases commencing during the period, in square feet\n4,022,122 \nWeighted Average Lease Term\n89 Months\nWeighted Average Free Rent Period\n140 Days\nTotal Transaction Costs Per Square Foot (6)\n$79.32 \nIncrease in Gross Rents (7)\n1.38 \n%\nIncrease in Net Rents (8)\n1.79 \n%\n \n__________________\n(1)\nTotal square feet from properties taken out of service during the year ended December 31, 2024 consists of 205,355 square feet at 1100 Winter Street, 162,274 square feet at 1050 Winter Street, 111,183 square feet at Kingstowne One, 71,420 square feet at 15825 Shady Grove Road and 30,000 square feet at 17 Hartwell Avenue.                  \n(2)\nTotal square feet from properties placed (and partially placed) in-service during the year ended December 31, 2024 consists of 239,908 square feet at 300 Binney Street, 187,048 square feet at 180 CityPoint, 117,907 square feet at 760 Boylston Street, 112,841 square feet at 103 CityPoint, 102,542 square feet at 360 Park Avenue South, 67,017 square feet at 651 Gateway and 3,858 square feet at Reston Next Office Phase II\n.\n58\nTable of Contents\n     \n(3)\nRepresents leases for which lease revenue recognition has commenced in accordance with GAAP during the year ended December 31, 2024\n.\n(4)\nRepresents leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2024 for which we either (1) commenced lease revenue recognition in such period or (2) will commence lease revenue recognition in subsequent periods, in accordance with GAAP, and includes leases at properties currently under development.

Business—Transactions During 2024\n.”\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements.  From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions.  In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.  Our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following:\n•\nPurchase price allocations,\n•\nImpairment and\n•\nImpairment related to unconsolidated joint ventures.\nEach of the above critical accounting estimates is described in more detail below.  \nReal Estate\nPurchase Price Allocations\nWe assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, “above-” and “below-market” leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities (including ground leases)) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant.  We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.\n59\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant.  We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the clients, the clients’ credit quality and expectations of lease renewals.  Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.\nWe record acquired “above-” and “below-market” leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.  Acquired “above-” and “below-market” lease values have been reflected within Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each client’s lease.  Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases.  In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions.  In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we completed two acquisitions in Washington, DC consisting of (1) 725 12th Street for a purchase price, excluding transaction costs, of $34.0 million and (2) our joint venture partner’s 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture entity that owned 901 New York Avenue.  At acquisition, the total net equity acquired for 901 New York Avenue was $20.0 million, which includes $10.0 million in cash that we paid for the joint venture partner's 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture.  These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nImpairment\nManagement reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  This evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period.  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates.  Any or all of such assumptions could differ materially from actual results in future periods.  Because cash flows on properties considered to be “long-lived assets to be held and used” are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset may be impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss.  If our hold strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate a shorter hold period, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material.  If we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.  At March 31, 2024, we evaluated the expected hold period for a portion of our Shady Grove property, consisting of 2 Choke Cherry Road, 2094 Gaither Road and a land parcel, located in Rockville, Maryland.  Based on a shorter-than-expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of a portion of the property that we anticipate selling to a third-party developer to its estimated fair value at March 31, 2024.  As a result, each of BXP and BPLP recognized an impairment loss of approximately $13.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nUnconsolidated\n \nJoint Ventures\nImpairment\nOur investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary.  This evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions.  We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary.

As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period.  Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio provides a complete understanding of our operating results.  Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in-service throughout each period compared (the “Same Property Portfolio”) and the changes attributable to the properties included in the Acquired, Placed In-Service, In or Held for Development or Redevelopment or Sold Portfolios.\nIn our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of NOI between periods more meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented.  We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in-service through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio.  The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties acquired, placed in-service or in or held for development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.\n64\nTable of Contents\n     \nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership, as applicable, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, plus (1) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, impairment loss, losses from interest rate contracts, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, payroll and related costs from management services contracts and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) unrealized gain on non-real estate investments, gains from investments in securities, interest and other income (loss), gains on sales of real estate, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and development and management services revenue.  We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership.  For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level.  Similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity).  In addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level.  NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs or real estate companies that define NOI differently.  \nWe believe that in order to understand our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  NOI should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to BXP, Inc. or net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nDepreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of limited partnership interest of BPLP (“OP Units”).  This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties.  The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense when those properties are sold.  For additional information see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2024 to the year ended December 31, 2023 \nThe table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio.  The Same Property Portfolio consists of 127 properties totaling approximately 40.3 million net rentable square feet, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures.  The Same Property Portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2023 and owned and in service through December 31, 2024.  The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment after January 1, 2023 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2024.  This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 with respect to the properties that were acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment or sold.

Hotel Net Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $51,224 and $47,357 less Hotel Expenses of $35,288 and $32,225, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n66\nTable of Contents\n     \nSame Property Portfolio\nLease Revenue (Excluding Termination Income)\nLease revenue (excluding termination income) from the Same Property Portfolio decreased by approximately $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  The decrease was a result of our average occupancy decreasing from 90.8% to 88.9%, resulting in a decrease of approximately $60.6 million, partially offset by revenue per square foot increasing by approximately $1.14, contributing approximately $39.0 million.\nTermination Income\nTermination income decreased by approximately $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.\nTermination income for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to 30 clients across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $9.3 million, with the largest contribution related to a retail client that terminated its lease early in Boston.\nTermination income for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to 28 clients across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $13.1 million, which was primarily related to clients that terminated leases early in Seattle.\nParking and Other Revenue\nParking and other revenue increased by approximately $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  Parking and other revenue increased by approximately $1.8 million and $11.8 million, respectively.  The increase in other revenue was primarily related to the View Boston observatory.\nReal Estate Operating Expenses\nReal estate operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased by approximately $55.7 million, or 4.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, due primarily to increases in (1) repairs and maintenance of approximately $18.3 million, or 9.9%, (2) utilities of approximately $11.0 million, or 9.8%, and (3) other real estate operating expenses of approximately $16.0 million, or 1.9%.  The increase in repairs and maintenance related primarily to properties in our Boston region.  The increase in utilities related primarily to properties in our New York region.

Although no longer in redevelopment, this property is not considered “in-service” as we are not actively leasing this property in anticipation of restarting redevelopment in the future. \n(2)\nThe Kendall Center Blue Parking Garage was taken out of service on January 4, 2023 and then demolished to support the development of 290 Binney Street. Real estate operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 included approximately $2.4 million of demolition costs. \n(3)\nLexington Office Park, 1050 and 1100 Winter Street, 17 Hartwell Avenue, Kingstowne One and a portion of Shady Grove Innovation District are no longer considered “in-service” because each property’s occupied percentage is less than 50% and we are no longer actively leasing the properties in anticipation of a future development/redevelopment. The properties will be considered held for development or redevelopment until the last client has vacated the property and the \n68\nTable of Contents\n     \nproperty is no longer revenue producing.  Shady Grove Innovation District is comprised of three buildings, 2092 and 2098 Gaither Road and 15825 Shady Grove Road that were taken out of service between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2024. \n(4)\n1100 Winter Street was taken out of service as of September 30, 2024.  Rental revenue at 1100 Winter Street for the year ended December 31, 2024 included approximately $6.4 million of termination income.\nResidential Net Operating Income\nNet operating income for our residential same properties increased by approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  \nThe following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our residential same properties for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nAverage Monthly Rental Rate (1)\nAverage Rental Rate Per Occupied Square Foot\nAverage Physical Occupancy (2)\nAverage Economic Occupancy (3)\nName\n2024\n2023\nChange (%)\n2024\n2023\nChange (%)\n2024\n2023\nChange (%)\n2024\n2023\nChange (%)\nProto Kendall Square\n$\n3,209 \n$\n3,076 \n4.3 \n%\n$\n5.90 \n$\n5.65 \n4.4 \n%\n94.9 \n%\n95.5 \n%\n(0.6)\n%\n94.8 \n%\n95.1 \n%\n(0.3)\n%\nThe Lofts at Atlantic Wharf\n$\n4,420 \n$\n4,432 \n(0.3)\n%\n$\n4.94 \n$\n4.91 \n0.6 \n%\n95.6 \n%\n95.6 \n%\n— \n%\n94.5 \n%\n95.6 \n%\n(1.2)\n%\nSignature at Reston\n$\n2,841 \n$\n2,698 \n5.3 \n%\n$\n2.92 \n$\n2.79 \n4.7 \n%\n95.6 \n%\n94.9 \n%\n0.7 \n%\n95.6 \n%\n94.3 \n%\n1.4 \n%\nThe Skylyne\n$\n3,387 \n$\n3,480 \n(2.7)\n%\n$\n4.28 \n$\n4.42 \n(3.2)\n%\n89.0 \n%\n91.1 \n%\n(2.3)\n%\n87.1 \n%\n89.1 \n%\n(2.2)\n%\n_____________  \n(1)\nAverage Monthly Rental Rate is calculated as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (A) rental revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, by (B) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period. \n(2)\nAverage Physical Occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.\n(3)\nAverage Economic Occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage.  Total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at Market Rents.  Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents.  By measuring vacant units at their Market Rents, Average Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property’s total possible gross revenue.  Market Rents used by us in calculating Economic Occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property’s units and publicly available market data. Actual market rents and trends in such rents for a region as reported by others may vary materially from Market Rents used by us.  Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions. \nHotel Net Operating Income \nThe Boston Marriott Cambridge hotel had net operating income of approximately $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, representing an increase of approximately $0.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \nThe following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the Boston Marriott Cambridge hotel for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n2024\n2023\nChange (%)\nOccupancy\n77.2 \n%\n72.8 \n%\n6.0 \n%\nAverage daily rate\n$\n331.41 \n$\n326.18 \n1.6 \n%\nREVPAR\n$\n255.73 \n$\n237.44 \n7.7 \n%\nOther Operating Revenue and Expense Items\nDevelopment and Management Services Revenue\nDevelopment and management services revenue decreased by approximately $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  Development services revenue and management services revenue decreased by approximately $6.1 million and $6.7 million, respectively.  The decrease in development services \n69\nTable of Contents\n     \nrevenue is primarily related to decreases in fees associated with tenant improvement projects in New York City and decreases in development income earned from unconsolidated joint ventures in the San Francisco and Washington DC regions. The decrease in management services revenue primarily related to the elimination of property and asset management fees earned from an unconsolidated joint venture in the Los Angeles region in which we acquired the joint venture partner’s interest in December 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased by approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to decreases in compensation expense and other general and administrative expenses of approximately $10.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.  The decrease in compensation expense related to an approximately $8.9 million decrease in other compensation expenses and approximately $1.2 million decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan.\nWages directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset or lease term.  Capitalized wages for each of the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $17.2 million and $16.1 million, respectively.  These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs decreased by approximately $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  In general, transaction costs relate to the formation of new joint ventures and the pursuit of other transactions are expensed as incurred. \nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP.  This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties.  The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense.  For additional information see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    \nBXP\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, as detailed below.\nPortfolio\nDepreciation and Amortization for the year ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(in thousands)\nSame Property Portfolio \n$\n800,814 \n$\n797,908 \n$\n2,906 \nProperties Acquired Portfolio\n55,236 \n2,112 \n53,124 \nProperties Placed In-Service Portfolio \n25,657 \n24,333 \n1,324 \nProperties in or Held for Development or Redevelopment Portfolio (1)\n5,484 \n6,460 \n(976)\n$\n887,191 \n$\n830,813 \n$\n56,378 \n_____________\n(1)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Kendall Center Blue Parking Garage was taken out of service and demolished to support the development of 290 Binney Street, an approximately 573,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded approximately $0.8 million of accelerated depreciation expense for the demolition of the garage, of which approximately $0.2 million related to the step-up of real estate assets.\n70\nTable of Contents\n     \nBPLP\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $56.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, as detailed below.\nPortfolio\nDepreciation and Amortization for the year ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(in thousands)\nSame Property Portfolio \n$\n794,006 \n$\n791,080 \n$\n2,926 \nProperties Acquired Portfolio\n55,236 \n2,112 \n53,124 \nProperties Placed In-Service Portfolio\n25,657 \n24,333 \n1,324 \nProperties in or Held for Development or Redevelopment Portfolio (1)\n5,484 \n6,280 \n(796)\n$\n880,383 \n$\n823,805 \n$\n56,578 \n_____________\n(1)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Kendall Center Blue Parking Garage was taken out of service and demolished to support the development of 290 Binney Street, an approximately 573,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, BPLP recorded approximately $0.6 million of accelerated depreciation expense for the demolition of the garage.\nDirect Reimbursements of Payroll and Related Costs From Management Services Contracts and Payroll and Related Costs From Management Service Contracts\nWe have determined that amounts reimbursed for payroll and related costs received from third parties in connection with management services contracts should be reflected on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have determined that we are the principal under these arrangements.  We anticipate that these two financial statement line items will generally offset each other.\nOther Income and Expense Items\nLoss from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $103.6 million primarily due to the recognition of non-cash impairment charges related to our investments in Colorado Center, Gateway Commons and Safeco Plaza aggregating approximately $341.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the recognition of non-cash impairment charges in the amount of $272.6 million related to our investments in Platform 16, 360 Park Avenue South, 200 Fifth Avenue and Safeco Plaza during the year ended December 31, 2023.  \nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2024, there was an approximately $21.8 million gain recognized from acquiring our joint venture partner’s economic ownership interest in 901 New York Avenue. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, there was an approximately $34.3 million net gain related to the disposition of our ownership interest in Metropolitan Square and an approximately $29.9 million net gain related to the acquisition of our joint venture partner’s ownership interest in Santa Monica Business Park that did not recur during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nGains on Sales of Real Estate\nThe $0.6 million and $0.5 million gains on sale of real estate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were related to the sale of real estate occurring in prior periods.  \nGains on sales of real estate may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP.  This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties.  The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold.  For additional information, see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \n71\nTable of Contents\n     \nInterest and Other Income (Loss)\nInterest and other income (loss) decreased by approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, due primarily to a decrease in our outstanding cash balances and corresponding lower interest income.\nGains from Investments in Securities\nGains from investments in securities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to deferred compensation plans that we maintain for BXP’s officers and former non-employee directors.  Under the deferred compensation plans, each officer or non-employee director who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer’s current income or the non-employee director’s compensation on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer or non-employee director.  In order to reduce our market risk relating to these plans, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer or non-employee director.  This enables us to generally match our liabilities to BXP’s officers or former non-employee directors under our deferred compensation plans with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk.  The performance of these investments is recorded as gains from investments in securities.  During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized gains of approximately $4.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively, on these investments.  By comparison, our general and administrative expense decreased by approximately $4.4 million and $5.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of decreases in our liability under our deferred compensation plans that was associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers and former non-employee directors of BXP participating in the plans.\nUnrealized Gain on Non-Real Estate Investments\nWe invest in non-real estate investments, which are primarily environmentally-focused investment funds.  As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized an unrealized gain of approximately $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively, due to the observable changes in the fair value of the investments.\nImpairment Loss\nAt March 31, 2024, we evaluated the expected hold period for a portion of our Shady Grove property, located in Rockville, Maryland, consisting of 2 Choke Cherry Road, 2094 Gaither Road and a land parcel.  Based on a shorter-than-expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of a portion of the property that we anticipate selling to a third-party developer to its estimated fair value at March 31, 2024.  As a result, each of BXP and BPLP recognized an impairment loss of approximately $13.6 million.  Our estimated fair value was based on Level 3 inputs as defined in ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” and on a pending offer from a third party (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nLosses from Interest Rate Contracts\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, to satisfy a lender requirement, we entered into two agreements with the same third-party to purchase and sell a $600.0 million interest rate cap.  We did not elect hedge accounting, and as such, any change in market value will be recognized at the end of the period.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a loss of approximately $79,000 from entering into these agreements.  We did not recognize any losses during the year ended December 31, 2024.  \n72\nTable of Contents\n     \nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by approximately $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, as detailed below.\nComponent\nChange in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023\n \n(in thousands)\nIncreases to interest expense due to:\nNew mortgage loan financings (1)\n$\n64,308 \nUnsecured commercial paper (2)\n18,582 \nIssuance of $750 million in aggregate principal of 6.500% senior notes due 2034 on May 15, 2023\n18,345 \nIssuance of $850 million in aggregate principal of 5.750% senior notes due 2035 on August 26, 2024\n16,979 \nOther interest expense (excluding senior notes)\n105 \nTotal increases to interest expense\n118,319 \nDecreases to interest expense due to:\nRepayment of $700 million in aggregate principal of 3.800% senior notes due 2024 on February 1, 2024\n(24,600)\nDecrease in interest associated with unsecured term loans and the unsecured credit facility, net (3)\n(13,430)\nRepayment of $500 million in aggregate principal of 3.125% senior notes due 2023 on September 1, 2023\n(10,672)\nDecrease in interest due to finance leases\n(2,109)\nIncrease in capitalized interest related to development projects\n(1,724)\nAmortization expense of financing fees \n(239)\nTotal decreases to interest expense\n(52,774)\nTotal change in interest expense\n$\n65,545 \n______________\n(1)\nConsists of the mortgage loan and, if applicable, fair value debt and swap adjustments collateralized by (1) 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street, 90 Broadway and Cambridge East Garage (also known as Kendall Center Green Garage) properties located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, (2) Santa Monica Business Park located in Santa Monica, California \nand (3) 901 New York Avenue located in Washington, DC\n (See Notes \n7 and \n8\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(2)\nOn April 17, 2024, BPLP established an unsecured commercial paper program (See Note \n7\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(3)\nIncludes, if applicable, swap adjustments (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nInterest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate or lease term.  As portions of properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest on that portion and interest is then expensed.  Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $42.0 million and $42.6 million, respectively.  These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.  The decrease in capitalized interest is primarily attributable to a development project that had a finance lease and is now placed in service.\nOn January 15, 2025, we repaid at maturity $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.200% unsecured senior notes.  The repayment was completed with available cash and proceeds from our August 2024 offering of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% unsecured senior notes due 2035.\nAt December 31, 2024, our variable rate debt consisted of (1) BPLP’s $2.0 billion 2021 Credit Facility, (2) BPLP’s $700.0 million 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and (3) BPLP’s $500.0 million unsecured commercial paper notes.  As of December 31, 2024, the 2021 Credit Facility did not have a balance outstanding.  In addition, we have the $100.0 million 2024 Unsecured Term Loan and $800.0 million of mortgage notes collateralized by Santa Monica Business Park and our 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street, 90 Broadway and Cambridge East Garage (also known \n73\nTable of Contents\n     \nas Kendall Center Green Garage) properties that bore interest at variable rates, which have all been hedged with interest rates swaps to fix SOFR for all or a portion of the applicable debt term.

Due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on BPLP’s financial statements.   \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nGeneral\nOur principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to:\n•\nfund normal recurring expenses;\n•\nmeet debt service and principal repayment obligations and balloon payments on maturing debt, including:\n•\n$700.0 million of principal outstanding on the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan due May 16, 2025,\n•\n$100.0 million of principal outstanding on the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan due September 26, 2025, for which we have three, one-year extension options, subject to customary conditions,\n•\n$1.0 billion of 3.650% unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2026, and\n•\namounts that become due under BPLP’s unsecured commercial paper program\n•\nfund capital calls from our unconsolidated joint venture investments to fund development costs, capital improvements, leasing costs and debt principal repayment;\n•\nfund development and redevelopment costs;\n74\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\nfund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs;\n•\nfund possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interests; and\n•\nmake the minimum distribution required to enable BXP to maintain its REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\nWe expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:\n•\ncash flow from operations;\n•\ndistribution of cash flows from joint ventures;\n•\ncash and cash equivalent balances;\n•\nborrowings under BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility, unsecured term loans, short-term bridge facilities and construction loans;\n•\nlong-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); \n•\nsales of real estate and interests in joint ventures owning real estate; \n•\nprivate equity sources, including institutional investors; and\n•\nissuances of BXP equity securities and/or preferred or common units of partnership interests in BPLP.\nWe draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs.  We expect to fund our current development/redevelopment projects primarily with our available cash balances, funding from institutional private equity partners, construction loans, unsecured term loans, proceeds from possible asset sales, BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility and BPLP's commercial paper program.  We use BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness, fund short-term development costs and for working capital.  We also use BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility to backstop BPLP’s commercial paper program.  Although we may seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may require guarantees by BPLP, the source of financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project’s size and duration, whether the project is owned by a joint venture, the extent of pre-leasing, our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.\n75\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe following table presents information on properties under construction/redevelopment as of December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nFinancings\nConstruction/Redevelopment Properties\nEstimated Stabilization Date\nLocation\n# of Buildings\nEstimated Square Feet\nInvestment to Date (1)(2)(3)\nEstimated Total Investment (1)(2)\nTotal Available (1)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2024 \n(1)\nEstimated Future Equity Requirement (1)(2)(4)\nPercentage Leased (5)\nOffice\n360 Park Avenue South (71% ownership) (Redevelopment)\nQ4 2026\nNew York, NY\n1\n450,000 \n$\n359,688 \n$\n418,300 \n$\n156,470 \n$\n156,470 \n$\n58,612 \n23 \n%\n(6)\nReston Next Office Phase II\nQ2 2026\nReston, VA\n1\n90,000 \n45,672 \n61,000 \n— \n— \n15,328 \n9 \n%\n(7)\n725 12th Street (Redevelopment)\nQ4 2030\nWashington, DC\n1\n320,000 \n51,447 \n349,600 \n— \n— \n298,153 \n47 \n%\n(8)\nTotal Office Properties under Construction/Redevelopment\n3\n860,000 \n456,807 \n828,900 \n156,470 \n156,470 \n372,093 \n30 \n%\nLaboratory/Life Sciences \n651 Gateway (50% ownership) (Redevelopment)\nQ3 2026\nSouth San Francisco, CA\n1\n327,000 \n132,083 \n167,100 \n— \n— \n35,017 \n21 \n%\n(9)\n290 Binney Street (55% ownership)\nQ2 2026\nCambridge, MA\n1\n573,000 \n212,002 \n508,000 \n— \n— \n295,998 \n100 \n%\n(10)\nTotal Laboratory/Life Sciences Properties under Construction/Redevelopment\n2\n900,000 \n344,085 \n675,100 \n— \n— \n331,015 \n71 \n%\nResidential\n121 Broadway Street (439 units)\nQ2 2029\nCambridge, MA\n1\n492,000 \n104,364 \n597,800 \n— \n— \n493,436 \n— \n%\nTotal Residential Property under Construction\n1\n492,000 \n104,364 \n597,800 \n— \n— \n493,436 \n— \n%\nRetail\nReston Next Retail\nQ4 2025\nReston, VA\n1\n33,000 \n24,427 \n26,600 \n— \n— \n2,173 \n13 \n%\nTotal Retail Properties under Construction\n1\n33,000 \n24,427 \n26,600 \n— \n— \n2,173 \n13 \n%\nTotal Properties under Construction/Redevelopment\n7\n2,285,000 \n$\n929,683 \n$\n2,128,400 \n$\n156,470 \n$\n156,470 \n$\n1,198,717 \n50 \n%\n(11)\n___________  \n(1)\nRepresents our share.  \n(2)\nEach of Investment to Date, Estimated Total Investment and Estimated Future Equity Requirement represent our share of acquisition expenses, as applicable, and reflect our share of the estimated net revenue/expenses that we expect to incur prior to stabilization of the project, including any amounts actually received or paid through December 31, 2024. \n(3)\nIncludes approximately $44.0 million of unpaid but accrued construction costs and leasing commissions.\n(4)\nExcludes approximately $44.0 million of unpaid but accrued construction costs and leasing commissions.\n(5)\nRepresents percentage leased as of February 21, 2025, including leases with future commencement dates.\n(6)\nAs of December 31, 2024, this property was 30% placed in-service.\n(7)\nAs of December 31, 2024, this property was 6% placed in-service.\n(8)\nWe acquired 725 12th Street on December 27, 2024 for a purchase price, excluding transaction costs, of $34.0 million. Concurrently with the acquisition, a lease was executed with McDermott Will & Emery LLP for approximately 152,000 square feet of the redeveloped building (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(9)\nAs of December 31, 2024, this property was 27% placed in-service.  This property was fully placed in-service on January 2, 2025 (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(10)\nOn March 21, 2024, we completed the sale of a 45% interest in 290 Binney Street (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The project budget reflects our 55% share of joint venture costs related to 290 Binney Street.  We have the sole obligation to construct an underground electrical vault for an estimated gross cost of $183.9 million.  We have entered into a contract to sell the electrical vault to a third party for a fixed price of $84.1 million upon completion.  The net investment of $99.8 million will be included in our outside basis in 290 Binney Street.  We have invested $71.9 million for the vault as of December 31, 2024.\n(11)\nPercentage leased excludes the residential property.\n76\nTable of Contents\n     \nWe seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing client turnover and controlling operating expenses.  Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses, interest earned on cash deposits and, from time to time, the sale of assets.  We believe these sources of capital will continue to provide the funds necessary for our short-term liquidity needs.  Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows and our ability to repay or refinance existing indebtedness as it matures.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had seven properties under development or redevelopment.  BXP’s Share of the estimated total investment for these projects is approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.3 billion remains to be funded through 2030.  \nSince the third quarter of 2024, we further strengthened our balance sheet by repaying debt and extending maturities.\n \nNotable transactions include:\n•\nOn October 8, 2024, we modified the mortgage loan collateralized by our Santa Monica Business Park properties located in Santa Monica, California (“SMBP Loan”).  The SMBP Loan had an outstanding principal balance of $200.0 million, bore interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum and was scheduled to mature on July 19, 2025.  The modified loan has an outstanding principal balance of $200.0 million, is scheduled to mature on October 8, 2028 and continues to bear interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum until July 19, 2025.  Beginning July 19, 2025, the mortgage loan will bear interest at Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.60% per annum through the maturity date.  The entire principal is subject to interest rate swap contracts to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of approximately 2.675% per annum through April 1, 2025 (See Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  \n•\nOn January 15, 2025, we repaid at maturity $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 3.200% unsecured senior notes.  The repayment was completed with available cash and proceeds from our August 2024 offering of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% unsecured senior notes due 2035.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt maturing through February 2026 was approximately $551.4 million.  This debt matures at different times through February 2026 and we expect to fund the repayment of this debt through a combination of refinancings in whole or in part, available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, draws on BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility, proceeds from BPLP’s unsecured commercial paper program, secured debt or unsecured debt.  \nWe expect net interest expense will be higher in 2025 as a result of lower projected interest income in 2025 due to (i) lower cash balances as a result of ongoing development costs in 2025 and (ii) the repayment of our $850.0 million unsecured senior notes at maturity on January 15, 2025 (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  We expect our interest expense will be flat or slightly higher in 2025 compared to 2024 (assuming no interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve) primarily due to the increased interest expense associated with BPLP’s August 2024 issuance of $850.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes offset by lower average outstanding debt balances.    \nAs of February 21, 2025, we had available cash of approximately $366.7 million (of which approximately $125.0 million was attributable to our consolidated joint venture partners).  Our liquidity and capital resources depend on a wide range of factors, and we believe that our access to capital and our strong liquidity, including the approximately $1.2 billion available under BPLP’s 2021 Credit Facility and our available cash, as of February 21, 2025, are sufficient to fund our remaining capital needs on existing development and redevelopment projects, fund acquisitions, repay our maturing indebtedness when due (if not refinanced or extended), satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and still allow us to act opportunistically on attractive investment opportunities.  We are currently in active negotiations for the disposition of three land sites and we expect to put an operating property into the market for sale in 2025.  If successful, these sales in aggregate could generate approximately $200.0 million of net proceeds in 2025, although it is possible that one of the land sales does not close until 2026.  However, there can be no assurance that we will complete any of these transactions on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.\nWe may seek to enhance our liquidity to fund our current and future development activity, pursue additional attractive investment opportunities and refinance or repay indebtedness.  Depending on then-current interest rates, \n77\nTable of Contents\n     \nthe overall conditions in the public and private debt and equity markets, and our existing and expected leverage at the time, we may decide to access one or more of these capital sources.  Doing so may result in greater cash and cash equivalents pending our use of the proceeds, and depending on the sources of liquidity, higher interest expense or share count. \nWe have not sold any shares under BXP’s $600.0 million “at the market” equity offering program.\nInflation \nWe are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations.  There are provisions in the majority of our client leases that protect us from, and mitigate the near term risk of, the impact of inflation.  These provisions include rent steps and resets to market, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per-square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per-square-foot allowance.  However, due to the long-term nature of the leases, the rent may not increase frequently enough to fully cover inflation.\nREIT Tax Distribution Considerations \nDividend \nAs a REIT, BXP is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that BXP currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income (excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments).  Our policy is for BXP to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax.  Holders of common and LTIP units (other than unearned MYLTIP units) of limited partnership interest in BPLP receive the same distribution per unit that is paid per share of BXP common stock.  \nBXP’s Board of Directors will continue to evaluate BXP’s dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income (including gains on sales), liquidity requirements and other circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by BXP’s Board of Directors will not differ materially from the current quarterly dividend amount. \nSales \nTo the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, BXP would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities.  Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of BXP’s common stock and REIT distribution requirements.  At a minimum, we expect that BXP would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for BXP to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. \nFrom time to time in select cases, whether due to a change in use, structuring issues to comply with applicable REIT regulations or other reasons, we may sell an asset that is held by a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”).  Such a sale by a TRS would be subject to federal and local taxes.  \nCash Flow Summary\nThe following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.\nCash and cash equivalents and cash held in escrows aggregated approximately $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately $0.3 billion.  The following table sets forth changes in cash flows:\n78\nTable of Contents\n     \n \nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,234,501 \n$\n1,301,520 \n$\n(67,019)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(1,237,396)\n(1,193,681)\n(43,715)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n(274,476)\n767,916 \n(1,042,392)\nOur principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our properties.  The weighted-average term of our in-place leases, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, excluding residential units, was approximately 7.8 years as of December 31, 2024, with occupancy rates historically in the range of 87% to 92%.  Generally, our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flows that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund regular quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements.  In addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and through secured and unsecured borrowings.\nCash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures.

The acquisition was completed with available cash.  Following the acquisition, we commenced redevelopment of the property.\n(2)\nConstruction in progress for the year ended December 31, 2024 included ongoing expenditures associated with 760 Boylston Street, 180 CityPoint, 103 CityPoint and 300 Binney Street, which were fully placed in-service during the year ended December 31, 2024.  In addition, we incurred costs associated with our continued development/redevelopment of Reston Next Office Phase II that was partially placed in-service, 290 Binney Street, 121 Broadway and 725 12th Street.  \nConstruction in progress for the year ended December 31, 2023 included ongoing expenditures associated with 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, 140 Kendrick Street Building A and the View Boston observatory at The Prudential Center, which were fully placed in-service during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 180 CityPoint and 103 CityPoint that were partially placed in-service during the year ended December 31, 2023.  In addition, we incurred costs associated with our continued development/redevelopment of Reston Next Office Phase II, 760 Boylston Street, 105 Carnegie Center, 290 Binney Street and 300 Binney Street.  On November 30, 2023, we elected to suspend redevelopment on 105 Carnegie Center located in Princeton, New Jersey.\n79\nTable of Contents\n     \n(3)\nOn January 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of our joint venture partner’s 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture that owns 901 New York Avenue, located in Washington, DC, for a gross purchase price of $10.0 million and we acquired net working capital, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately $16.1 million.\nOn December 14, 2023, we acquired our joint venture partner’s 45% interest in the joint venture entity that owns Santa Monica Business Park located in Santa Monica, California.  The acquisition was completed for a gross purchase price of $38.0 million and we acquired net working capital, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately $20 million.  Santa Monica Business Park is a 47-acre office park consisting of 21 buildings totaling approximately 1.2 million net rentable square feet.  \n(4)\nCapital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted primarily of cash contributions of approximately $62.7 million, $32.1 million, $13.5 million and $11.6 million to our 360 Park Avenue South, Gateway Commons, Platform 16 and Dock 72 joint ventures, respectively.\nCapital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of cash contributions of approximately $62.6 million, $42.7 million, $18.0 million, $18.0 million, $14.9 million, $10.6 million and $10.1 million to our Gateway Commons, Platform 16, Worldgate Drive, Dock 72, 360 Park Avenue South, 751 Gateway and Safeco Plaza joint ventures, respectively.  On January 31, 2023, we entered into a new joint venture for 13100 and 13150 Worldgate Drive located in Herndon, Virginia.\n(5)\nCapital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily of cash distributions\n from our 360 Park Avenue South joint venture.  \n(6)\nOn October 2, 2023, a joint venture in which we owned a 20% interest completed the restructuring of Metropolitan Square which included among other items, the closing of a new mezzanine loan with a maximum principal amount of $100.0 million.  The new mezzanine loan may be drawn upon for future lease-up, operating and other costs on an as needed basis, and amounts borrowed will bear interest at a per annum rate of 12%, compounded monthly.  We will fund 20%, or up to $20.0 million, of any amounts borrowed under the new mezzanine loan.  For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had funded approximately $3.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively. \nOn June 5, 2023, a joint venture in which we own a 30% interest repaid the existing construction loan collateralized by its 500 North Capitol Street, NW property and obtained new mortgage loans with related parties.  At the time of the payoff, the outstanding balance of the loan totaled approximately $105.0 million and was scheduled to mature on June 6, 2023.  The new mortgage loans have an aggregate principal balance of $105.0 million, bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 6.83% per annum and mature on June 5, 2026.  Our portion of the mortgage loans, $10.5 million, has been reflected as a Related Party Note Receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  500 North Capitol Street, NW is an approximately 231,000 square foot premier workplace in Washington, DC.\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $274.5 million.  This amount consisted primarily of the repayment of BPLP’s $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.800% unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2024, repayment of $500.0 million of the outstanding balance of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and payment of our regular dividends and distributions to our shareholders and unitholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests in property partnerships, partially offset by the issuance of BPLP’s $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.750% unsecured senior notes due 2035, $500.0 million of unsecured commercial paper borrowings, and $374.7 million in contributions from noncontrolling interests in property partnerships and proceeds from the sale of a 45% interest in 290 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading \n“Debt Financing\n.”\n80\nTable of Contents\n     \nCapitalization\nThe following table presents Consolidated Market Capitalization and BXP’s Share of Market Capitalization, as well as the corresponding ratios of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Market Capitalization and BXP’s Share of Debt to BXP’s Share of Market Capitalization (in thousands, except for percentages):\nDecember 31, 2024\nShares / Units Outstanding\nCommon Stock Equivalent\nEquivalent Value (1)\nCommon Stock\n158,175 \n158,175 \n$\n11,761,893 \nCommon Operating Partnership Units\n18,066 \n18,066 \n1,343,388 \n(2)\nTotal Equity\n176,241 \n$\n13,105,281 \nConsolidated Debt \n$\n16,220,499 \nAdd:\nBXP’s share of unconsolidated joint venture debt (3)\n1,383,764 \nSubtract:\nPartners’ share of Consolidated Debt (4)\n1,362,367 \nBXP’s Share of Debt\n$\n16,241,896 \nConsolidated Market Capitalization\n$\n29,325,780 \nBXP’s Share of Market Capitalization\n$\n29,347,177 \nConsolidated Debt/Consolidated Market Capitalization\n55.31 \n%\nBXP’s Share of Debt/BXP’s Share of Market Capitalization\n55.34 \n%\n_______________  \n(1)\nValues are based on the closing price per share of BXP’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on December 31, 2024 of $74.36.\n(2)\nIncludes long-term incentive plan units (including 2012 OPP Units and 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units but excluding the 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units because the three-year performance periods had not ended as of December 31, 2024).\n(3)\nSee page 88 for additional information.\n(4)\nSee page 86 for additional information.\nConsolidated Debt to Consolidated Market Capitalization Ratio is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector.  We present this measure as a percentage and it is calculated by dividing (A) our consolidated debt by (B) our consolidated market capitalization, which is the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our consolidated debt.  Consolidated market capitalization is the sum of:\n(1)     our consolidated debt; plus\n(2)     the product of (x) the closing price per share of BXP common stock on December 31, 2024, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, multiplied by (y) the sum of:\n(i)     the number of outstanding shares of common stock of BXP, \n(ii)     the number of outstanding OP Units in BPLP (excluding OP Units held by BXP),\n(iii)     the number of OP Units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP Units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, and\n(iv)     the number of OP Units issuable upon conversion of 2012 OPP Units, and 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units.\nThe calculation of consolidated market capitalization does not include LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards unless and until certain performance thresholds are achieved and they are earned.  Because their three-year performance periods have not yet ended, 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units are not included in this calculation as of December 31, 2024.  \n81\nTable of Contents\n     \nWe also present BXP’s Share of Market Capitalization and BXP’s Share of Debt/BXP’s Share of Market Capitalization, which are calculated in the same manner, except that BXP’s Share of Debt is utilized instead of our consolidated debt in both the numerator and the denominator.  BXP’s Share of Debt is defined as our consolidated debt plus our share of debt from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon our ownership percentage), minus our partners’ share of debt from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners’ percentage ownership interests adjusted for basis differentials).  Management believes that BXP’s Share of Debt provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it includes our share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and excludes our partners’ share of debt from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis.  We have several significant joint ventures and presenting various measures of financial condition in this manner can help investors better understand our financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures.  We caution investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating BXP’s Share of Debt may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture.  For example, in addition to partners’ interests in profits and capital, venture agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both for routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, financing and guarantees, liquidations and other matters.  Moreover, in some cases we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, the joint venture in which case GAAP requires that we account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting and we do not consolidate it for financial reporting purposes.  In other cases, GAAP requires that we consolidate the venture even though our partner(s) own(s) a significant percentage interest.  As a result, management believes that the presentation of BXP’s Share of a financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered with and as a supplement to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe present these supplemental ratios because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and because different investors and lenders consider one or both of these ratios.  Investors should understand that these ratios are, in part, a function of the market price of the common stock of BXP and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price, and they do not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations.  However, for a company like BXP, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, these ratios may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as they are evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.\nFor a discussion of our unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness, see “\nLiquidity and Capital Resources—Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt” w\nithin “\nItem 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n” and for a discussion of our consolidated joint venture indebtedness see \n“Liquidity and Capital Resources—Mortgage Notes Payable\n” within “\nItem 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.”\nDebt Financing\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $16.2 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing approximately 55.31% of our Consolidated Market Capitalization as calculated above consisting of approximately (1) $10.6 billion (net of discount and deferred financing fees) in publicly traded unsecured senior notes having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 4.07% per annum and maturities in 2025 through 2035 (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (2) $4.3 billion (net of deferred financing fees and fair value interest adjustments) of property-specific mortgage debt having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 4.17% per annum and a weighted-average term of 3.8 years, (3) $0.8 billion (net of deferred financing fees and fair value interest adjustments) of unsecured term loans having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 5.88% per annum with maturities in 2025, and (4) $0.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper borrowings having a weighted-average interest rate of 4.79% per annum and a weighted-average maturity of 38 days, from the issuance date.\n82\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe table below summarizes the aggregate carrying value of our outstanding indebtedness, as well as Consolidated Debt Financing Statistics at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.  \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n \n(dollars in thousands)\nDebt Summary:\nBalance\nMortgage notes payable, net\n$\n4,276,609 \n$\n4,166,379 \nUnsecured senior notes, net\n10,645,077 \n10,491,617 \nUnsecured line of credit\n— \n— \nUnsecured term loans, net\n798,813 \n1,198,301 \nUnsecured commercial paper\n500,000 \n— \nConsolidated Debt\n16,220,499 \n15,856,297 \nAdd:\nBXP’s share of unconsolidated joint venture debt, net (1)\n1,383,764 \n1,421,655 \nSubtract:\nPartners’ share of consolidated mortgage notes payable, net (2)\n1,362,367 \n1,360,375 \nBXP’s Share of Debt\n$\n16,241,896 \n$\n15,917,577 \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nConsolidated Debt Financing Statistics:\nPercent of total debt:\nFixed rate (3)\n92.61 \n%\n100.00 \n%\nVariable rate\n7.39 \n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n100.00 \n%\n100.00 \n%\nGAAP Weighted-average interest rate at end of period:\nFixed rate (3)\n4.11 \n%\n4.11 \n%\nVariable rate\n5.47 \n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n4.21 \n%\n4.11 \n%\nCoupon/Stated Weighted-average interest rate at end of period:\nFixed rate (3)\n3.89 \n%\n3.96 \n%\nVariable rate\n5.34 \n%\n— \n%\nTotal\n4.00 \n%\n3.96 \n%\nWeighted-average maturity at end of period (in years):\nFixed rate (3)\n4.6 \n4.6 \nVariable rate\n0.2 \n— \nTotal\n4.3 \n4.6 \n_______________\n(1)\nSee page 88 for additional information.\n(2)\nSee page 86 for additional information. \n(3)\nAt December 31, 2024, BPLP’s $100.0 million 2024 Unsecured Term Loan and two of our mortgage loans aggregating approximately $800.0 million bore interest at variable rates.  We entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively fixed the variability of these loans for all or a portion of the applicable debt term and as such, they are reflected in our Fixed rate statistics.  At December 31, 2023, BPLP’s 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and two of our mortgage loans aggregating approximately $900.0 million bore interest at variable rates that were subject to interest rate swaps that effectively fixed the interest rate for all or a portion of the applicable debt term.  As such, they are reflected in our Fixed rate statistics.\n83\nTable of Contents\n     \nUnsecured Credit Facility\nThe 2021 Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $2.0 billion, as described below, through BPLP’s revolving facility, subject to customary conditions.  The 2021 Credit Facility matures on June 15, 2026 and includes a sustainability-linked pricing component.  Under the 2021 Credit Facility, BPLP had the option to increase the original total commitment of $1.5 billion by up to an additional $500.0 million by increasing the amount of the revolving facility and/or by incurring one or more term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions (the “Accordion Option”).  On September 28, 2023, BPLP exercised a portion of the Accordion Option, which increased the then maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 Credit Facility from $1.5 billion to $1.815 billion.  On April 29, 2024, BPLP exercised the remainder of the Accordion Option and further increased the maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 Credit Facility to $2.0 billion.  All other terms of the 2021 Credit Facility remain unchanged.\nBased on BPLP’s December 31, 2024 credit rating, (1) the applicable Daily SOFR, Term SOFR, alternative currency daily rate, and alternative currency term rate margins are 0.850%, (2) the alternate base rate margin is zero basis points and (3) the facility fee is 0.20% per annum.\nThe 2021 Credit Facility is used as a backstop for BPLP’s $500.0 million unsecured commercial paper program (See “\nUnsecured Commercial Paper” \nbelow).  As such, BPLP intends to maintain, at a minimum, availability under the 2021 Credit Facility in an amount equal to the amount of unsecured commercial paper notes outstanding.  \nAt December 31, 2024, BPLP had no borrowings under its 2021 Credit Facility, outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $5.4 million, and $500.0 million is being used as a backstop for the commercial paper program.  At February 21, 2025, BPLP had $310.0 million outstanding under its 2021 Credit Facility, outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $5.4 million, and $500.0 million is being used as a backstop for the commercial paper program.  Therefore, at December 31, 2024 and February 21, 2025, BPLP has the ability to borrow approximately $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.\nUnsecured Term Loans\nThe 2023 Unsecured Term Loan provided for a single borrowing of up to $1.2 billion.  Upon entry into the credit agreement in January 2023, BPLP exercised its option to draw $1.2 billion under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan.  Under the credit agreement governing the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan, BPLP may, at any time prior to the maturity date, increase total commitments by up to an additional $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount by increasing the existing 2023 Unsecured Term Loan or incurring one or more additional term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions.  On April 29, 2024, BPLP repaid $500.0 million of the outstanding balance under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan from the proceeds of its unsecured commercial paper program (See “\nUnsecured Commercial Paper\n” below).  The 2023 Unsecured Term Loan had an initial maturity date of May 16, 2024, with one 12-month extension option, subject to customary conditions.  On May 16, 2024, BPLP exercised its option to extend the maturity date of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan to May 16, 2025.  All other terms of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan remain unchanged. \nAt BPLP’s option, loans under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, (b) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (c) Term SOFR for a one-month period plus 1.00%, and (d) 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0 to 60 basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating; or (2) a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR with a one-month period plus a margin ranging from 75 to 160 basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating.  \nOn September 27, 2024, BPLP entered into the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan with the Lender under the SMBP Loan.  Upon entry into the credit agreement, BPLP exercised its option to draw $100.0 million under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan.  The proceeds were used to repay the portion of the SMBP Loan held by the Lender.  After the repayment, the SMBP Loan had a remaining principal balance of $200.0 million (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The 2024 Unsecured Term Loan matures on September 26, 2025 with three, one-year extension options, subject to customary conditions.\nAt BPLP’s option, loans under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) zero, (b) Prime Rate, (c) the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (d) Term SOFR for a one-month period plus 1.10%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0 to 60 basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating; or (2) a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR with a one-month period plus a margin ranging from 75 to 160 basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating.  \n84\nTable of Contents\n     \nBased on BPLP’s December 31, 2024 credit rating, (1) the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus 1.05% per annum and (2) the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.05% per annum.  The 2024 Unsecured Term Loan is subject to an existing interest rate swap to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a fixed rate of approximately 2.688% per annum for a period that ends on April 1, 2025 (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  At December 31, 2024 and February 21, 2025, BPLP had $700.0 million and $100.0 million of principal outstanding under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and 2024 Unsecured Term Loan, respectively. \nUnsecured Senior Notes\nFor a description of BPLP’s outstanding unsecured senior notes as of December 31, 2024, See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn February 1, 2024, BPLP repaid $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.800% senior notes due February 1, 2024.  The repayment was completed with available cash.  The repayment price was approximately $713.3 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately $13.3 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repayment date.  Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid.\nOn August 26, 2024, BPLP completed a public offering of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.750% unsecured senior notes due 2035.  The notes were priced at 99.961% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 5.842% per annum to maturity. The notes will mature on January 15, 2035, unless earlier redeemed.  The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $841.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses.\nOn January 15, 2025, BPLP repaid $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.200% senior notes due January 15, 2025.  The repayment was completed with available cash and the proceeds from BPLP’s August 2024 offering of unsecured senior notes.  The repayment price was approximately $863.6 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately $13.6 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repayment date.  Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid.  \nThe indenture relating to the unsecured senior notes contains certain financial restrictions and requirements, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of greater than 1.50, and (4) an unencumbered asset value of not less than 150% of unsecured debt.  At December 31, 2024, BPLP was in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements.\nUnsecured Commercial Paper \nOn April 17, 2024, BPLP established an unsecured commercial paper program.  Under the terms of the program, BPLP may issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of $500.0 million with varying maturities of up to one year.  Amounts available under the unsecured commercial paper program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time.  The notes are sold in private placements and rank pari passu with all of BPLP’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, including its outstanding senior notes.  The unsecured commercial paper program is backstopped by available capacity under the 2021 Credit Facility.  At December 31, 2024, BPLP had an aggregate of $500.0 million of unsecured commercial paper notes outstanding that bore interest at a weighted-average rate of approximately 4.79% per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of 38 days, from the issuance date.  At February 21, 2025, BPLP had an aggregate of $500.0 million of commercial paper notes outstanding that bore interest at a weighted-average rate of approximately 4.64% per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of 46 days, from the issuance date.  Proceeds from the unsecured commercial paper program were used to reduce BPLP’s 2023 Unsecured Term Loan from $1.2 billion to $700.0 million.\nMortgage Notes Payable\nOn January 8, 2024, we acquired our joint venture partner’s 50% economic ownership interest in the joint venture that owns 901 New York Avenue located in Washington, DC (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The property is subject to existing mortgage indebtedness.  At acquisition, the mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of approximately $207.1 million, bore interest at 3.61% per annum and was scheduled to mature on January 5, 2025.  The mortgage loan was recorded at a fair value of approximately $198.7 million.  On \n85\nTable of Contents\n     \nJanuary 11, 2024, we modified the mortgage loan to provide for two extension options totaling five years of additional term, each subject to certain conditions.  On December 20, 2024, we exercised the first extension option to extend the maturity date to January 5, 2029.  At the time of the extension, the outstanding principal balance was $202.3 million.  The extended loan bears interest at 5.00% per annum beginning January 5, 2025.  The loan has a one-year extension option remaining, subject to certain conditions. \nOn October 8, 2024, we modified the mortgage loan collateralized by our Santa Monica Business Park properties located in Santa Monica, California.  The mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of $200.0 million, bore interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum and was scheduled to mature on July 19, 2025.  The modified loan is scheduled to mature on October 8, 2028 and continues to bear interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum until July 19, 2025.  Beginning July 19, 2025, the mortgage loan will bear interest at Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.60% per annum through the maturity date.  The entire principal is subject to interest rate swap contracts to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of approximately 2.675% per annum through April 1, 2025 (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The mortgage loan requires monthly interest-only payments during the term of the loan, with the entire principal due at maturity.  Santa Monica Business Park is an office park consisting of 21 buildings totaling approximately 1.2 million net rentable square feet.\nThe following represents the outstanding mortgage notes payable, net at December 31, 2024:\nProperties\nStated Interest Rate\nGAAP Interest Rate (1)\nStated Principal Amount\nFair Value Adjustment and Deferred Financing Costs, Net \nCarrying Amount\nCarrying Amount (Partners\n’\n Share)\nMaturity Date\n \n(dollars in thousands)\nWholly-owned\n901 New York Avenue\n3.61 \n%\n7.69 \n%\n$\n202,313 \n$\n(621)\n$\n201,692 \nN/A\n(2)\nJanuary 5, 2029\nSanta Monica Business Park\n4.05 \n%\n6.65 \n%\n200,000 \n(1,979)\n198,021 \nN/A\n(3)(4)\nOctober 8, 2028\n90 Broadway, 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street, and Cambridge East Garage (also known as Kendall Center Green Garage)\n6.04 \n%\n6.27 \n%\n600,000 \n(5,131)\n594,869 \nN/A\n(3)(5)\nOctober 26, 2028\nSubtotal\n1,002,313 \n(7,731)\n994,582 \nN/A\nConsolidated Joint Ventures\n767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building)\n3.43 \n%\n3.64 \n%\n2,300,000 \n(8,502)\n2,291,498 \n$\n916,629 \n(3)(6)(7)\nJune 9, 2027\n601 Lexington Avenue\n2.79 \n%\n2.93 \n%\n1,000,000 \n(9,471)\n990,529 \n445,738 \n(3)(8)\nJanuary 9, 2032\nSubtotal\n3,300,000 \n(17,973)\n3,282,027 \n1,362,367 \nTotal\n$\n4,302,313 \n$\n(25,704)\n$\n4,276,609 \n$\n1,362,367 \n_______________ \n(1)\nThe GAAP interest rate differs from the stated interest rate due to the inclusion of the amortization of financing charges, the effects of hedging transactions (if any) and adjustments required under Accounting Standards Codification 805 “Business Combinations” to reflect loans and swaps at their fair values (if any).\n(2)\nCarrying amount includes an approximately $0.1 million fair value interest adjustment.  Beginning January 5, 2025, the loan will bear interest at a stated fixed rate of 5.0% per annum.  The loan has a one-year extension option remaining, subject to certain conditions.\n(3)\nThe mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.\n(4)\nThe mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate of Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38% per annum (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The borrower under the loan entered into interest rate swap contracts to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 2.675% for the period commencing on February 1, 2023 and ending on April 1, 2025.  Stated interest rate reflects the weighted average fixed interest rate based on the interest rate swap contracts plus 1.38% per annum.  Carrying amount includes an approximately $1.0 million fair value interest adjustment and excludes the adjustment required to reflect the interest rate swap at fair value upon acquisition of approximately $0.9 million.  Beginning July 19, 2025, the mortgage loan will bear interest at Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.60% per annum through the maturity date.\n(5)\nThe mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate of Daily Compounded SOFR plus 2.25% per annum.  On December 7, 2023, BPLP entered into three interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $600.0 million to fix Daily Compounded SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 3.7925% for the period commencing on December 15, 2023 and ending on October 26, 2028.  The stated interest rate reflects the weighted average fixed interest rate based on the interest rate swap contracts plus 2.25% per annum. \n86\nTable of Contents\n     \n(6)\nThis property is owned by a consolidated entity in which we have a 60% interest.  The partners’ share of the carrying amount has been adjusted for basis differentials.\n(7)\nIn connection with the refinancing of the loan, we guaranteed the consolidated entity’s obligation to fund various reserves for tenant improvement costs and allowances, leasing commissions and free rent obligations in lieu of cash deposits.

Fourteen of these ventures have mortgage indebtedness.  We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities.  As a result, we account for them using the equity method of accounting.  See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  At December 31, 2024, the aggregate carrying amount of debt, including both our and our partners’ share, incurred by these ventures was approximately $3.2 billion (of which our proportionate share is approximately $1.4 billion).  The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2024.

The joint venture entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a financial institution to limit its exposure to increases in the SOFR rate at a cap of 2.50% per annum on a notional amount of $250.0 million through September 1, 2025.\n(10)\nThe indebtedness consists of (x) a $70.0 million mortgage loan payable (Note A) which bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.23% per annum, and (y) a $35.0 million mortgage loan payable (Note B) which bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.03% per annum. We provided $10.5 million of the Note B mortgage financing to the joint venture. Our portion of the loan is reflected as Related Party Note Receivables, Net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(11)\nThe joint venture entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $600.0 million through June 2028, resulting in a fixed rate of approximately 4.34% per annum through the expiration of the interest rate swap contracts.

The joint venture is negotiating a new third-party loan, however, there can be no assurance that the joint venture will enter into a new third-party loan on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.  We are the lender of the loan, and the loan and accrued interest are reflected as Related Party Note Receivables, Net and Tenant and Other Receivables, Net, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(13)\nThe construction financing has a borrowing capacity of $140.0 million.\n89\nTable of Contents\n     \nMarket Risk \nMarket risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates.  Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates.  Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates.  The fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates.  We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration.  We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy clients in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately 92.61% of our outstanding debt, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures and after taking into account hedging agreements, has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of the hedging agreements.  We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions.  Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions.  This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt.  Our strategy mitigates against future increases in our interest rates.\nIncluding the effects of interest rate swaps, at December 31, 2024, our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on our fixed rate outstanding Consolidated Debt was 3.89% per annum.  At December 31, 2024, we had approximately $2.1 billion of consolidated variable rate debt outstanding, including $800.0 million of unsecured term loans, $500.0 million of unsecured commercial paper borrowings and approximately $800.0 million of secured debt.  However, we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating $800.0 million for our secured debt and $100.0 million for BPLP’s 2024 Unsecured Term Loan, thus fixing the interest rates for all, or a portion of the applicable debt term (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to interest rate contracts in place as of December 31, 2024 and their respective fair values).  For example, if market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately $21.0 million, on an annualized basis, for the year ended December 31, 2024.  \nThe information above does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt.  For a discussion concerning our unconsolidated joint venture debt, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “\nItem 7\n—\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n—\nLiquidity and Capital Resources—Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt.\n”\nFunds from Operations\nPursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), we calculate Funds from Operations, or “FFO,” for each of BXP and BPLP by adjusting net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership (computed in accordance with GAAP), respectively, for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, including a change in control, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and our share of real estate-related depreciation and amortization.  FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure.  We believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and helps make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful.  Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales or a change in control of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. \nOur computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently.  We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to BXP, Inc. or net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  \n90\nTable of Contents\n     \nBXP\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to BXP, Inc. to FFO attributable to BXP, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n \nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in thousands)\nNet income attributable to BXP, Inc.\n$\n14,272 \n$\n190,215 \n$\n848,947 \nAdd:\nNoncontrolling interest—common units of the Operating Partnership\n2,400 \n22,548 \n96,780 \nNoncontrolling interests in property partnerships\n67,516 \n78,661 \n74,857 \nNet income\n84,188 \n291,424 \n1,020,584 \nAdd:\nDepreciation and amortization \n887,191 \n830,813 \n749,775 \nNoncontrolling interests in property partnerships’ share of depreciation and amortization\n(76,660)\n(73,027)\n(70,208)\nBXP’s share of depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated joint ventures\n81,904 \n101,199 \n89,275 \nCorporate-related depreciation and amortization\n(1,710)\n(1,810)\n(1,679)\nNon-real estate depreciation and amortization\n8,520 \n(1,681)\n— \nImpairment loss\n13,615 \n— \n— \nImpairment losses included within loss from unconsolidated joint ventures (1)\n341,338 \n272,603 \n50,705 \nLess:\nGain on sale / consolidation included within loss from unconsolidated joint ventures (2)\n21,696 \n28,412 \n— \nGain on investment included within loss from unconsolidated joint ventures (3)\n— \n35,756 \n— \nGains on sales of real estate\n602 \n517 \n437,019 \nGain on sales-type lease\n— \n— \n10,058 \nGain on sales-type lease included within loss from unconsolidated joint ventures\n— \n1,368 \n— \nUnrealized gain (loss) on non-real estate investment\n546 \n239 \n(150)\nNoncontrolling interests in property partnerships\n67,516 \n78,661 \n74,857 \nFunds from Operations (FFO) attributable to the Operating Partnership common unitholders (including BXP, Inc.)\n1,248,026 \n1,274,568 \n1,316,668 \nLess:\nNoncontrolling interest—common units of the Operating Partnership’s share of funds from operations\n127,548 \n130,771 \n             \n133,115 \nFunds from Operations attributable to BXP, Inc.\n$\n1,120,478 \n$\n1,143,797 \n$\n1,183,553 \nOur percentage share of Funds from Operations—basic\n89.78 \n%\n89.74 \n%\n89.89 \n%\nWeighted average shares outstanding—basic\n157,468 \n156,863 \n156,726 \n___________\n(1)\nThe impairment loss on investment in unconsolidated joint venture consists of an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments in (i) Colorado Center, Gateway Commons and Safeco Plaza aggregating approximately $341.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (ii) Platform 16, 360 Park Avenue South, 200 Fifth Avenue and Safeco Plaza aggregating approximately $272.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and (iii) the Dock 72 unconsolidated joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2022.  \n(2)\nOn January 8, 2024, we acquired our joint venture partner’s 50% economic ownership interest in 901 New York Avenue located in Washington, DC for a gross purchase price of $10.0 million.

In addition, we signed leases for approximately 286,600 square feet of first generation leases.  The client-related obligations for the development properties are included within the projects’ “Estimated Total Investment” referred to in “\nItem 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\n  In the aggregate, during 2024, we signed leases for approximately 5.6 million square feet of space and incurred aggregate client-related obligations of approximately $597.3 million, or approximately $106 per square foot.\nAdopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”).  ASU 2023-07 improves reportable segment disclosure requirements for public business entities primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit (referred to as the “significant expense principle”).  ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this accounting standard on January 1, 2024. While the adoption has no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, it has resulted in incremental disclosures within the footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). \nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, “Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60)” (“ASU 2023-05”).  ASU 2023-05 is intended to (1) address accounting for contributions made to a joint venture upon formation and (2) reduce diversity in practice.  This ASU will apply to joint ventures that meet the definition of a corporate joint venture under GAAP, thus limiting its scope to joint ventures not controlled and therefore not consolidated by any joint venture investor.  This accounting standard is effective for joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025.  We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2025.\n97\nTable of Contents\n     \nNewly Issued Accounting Pronouncements \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)” (“ASU 2024-03”):  ASU 2024-03 will require entities to provide enhanced disclosures related to certain expense categories included in income statement captions. The ASU aims to increase transparency and provide investors with more detailed information about the nature of expenses reported on the face of the income statement. The new standard does not change the requirements for the presentation of expenses on the face of the income statement.  Under this ASU, entities are required to disaggregate, in a tabular format, expense captions presented on the face of the income statement — excluding earnings or losses from equity method investments — if they include any of the following expense categories: purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation or depletion.  For any remaining items within each relevant expense caption, entities must provide a qualitative description of the nature of those expenses. The new ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2024-03 may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes. \n98\nTable of Contents\n     \nITEM 7A—\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to certain market risks, one of the most predominant of which is a change in interest rates. Unless we have entered into interest rate swaps or other derivatives to fix the interest rate, increases in interest rates can result in increased interest expense under our 2021 Credit Facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured commercial paper, certain mortgage loans and other debt that bears interest at variable rates.  Increases in interest rates can also result in increased interest expense when our fixed rate debt matures and needs to be refinanced.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately $14.1 billion of our indebtedness bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments is not affected by changes in the market interest rates.  The remaining approximately $2.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness bore interest at variable rates, including approximately $800.0 million of unsecured term loans, $500.0 million of unsecured commercial paper borrowings and approximately $800.0 million of secured debt.  However, we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating $800.0 million for our secured debt and $100.0 million for BPLP’s 2024 Unsecured Term Loan, thus fixing the interest rates for all, or a portion of the applicable debt term (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to interest rate swap contracts in place as of December 31, 2024 and their respective fair values).  Therefore, as of December 31, 2024, we have $1.2 billion of variable rate debt outstanding.   \nThe following table presents our aggregate debt obligations carrying value, estimated fair value and where applicable, the corresponding weighted-average GAAP interest rates sorted by maturity date as of December 31, 2024. \nThe table below does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt.  For a discussion concerning our unconsolidated joint venture debt, including interest rate swaps, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “\nItem 7\n—\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n—\nLiquidity and Capital Resources—Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt.\n”\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030+\nTotal\nEstimated Fair Value\n(dollars in thousands)\nMortgage debt, net\nFixed Rate\n$\n(835)\n$\n(611)\n$\n2,301,592 \n$\n3,341 \n$\n182,961 \n$\n997,271 \n$\n3,483,719 \n$\n3,014,797 \nGAAP Average Interest Rate\n— \n%\n7.69 \n%\n3.65 \n%\n7.69 \n%\n7.69 \n%\n2.93 \n%\n3.67 \n%\nVariable Rate\n(2,625)\n(1,596)\n(1,596)\n798,707 \n— \n— \n792,890 \n793,298 \nSubtotal\n$\n(3,460)\n$\n(2,207)\n$\n2,299,996 \n$\n802,048 \n$\n182,961 \n$\n997,271 \n$\n4,276,609 \n$\n3,808,095 \n \nUnsecured debt, net\nFixed Rate\n$\n838,976 \n$\n1,990,365 \n$\n741,736 \n$\n992,956 \n$\n844,563 \n$\n5,236,481 \n$\n10,645,077 \n$\n10,005,606 \nGAAP Average Interest Rate\n3.35 \n%\n3.63 \n%\n6.92 \n%\n4.63 \n%\n3.51 \n%\n3.92 \n%\n4.07 \n%\nVariable Rate\n1,298,813 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n1,298,813 \n1,299,580 \nSubtotal\n$\n2,137,789 \n$\n1,990,365 \n$\n741,736 \n$\n992,956 \n$\n844,563 \n$\n5,236,481 \n$\n11,943,890 \n$\n11,305,186 \nTotal Debt\n$\n2,134,329 \n$\n1,988,158 \n$\n3,041,732 \n$\n1,795,004 \n$\n1,027,524 \n$\n6,233,752 \n$\n16,220,499 \n$\n15,113,281 \nAt December 31, 2024, the weighted-average stated interest rates on the fixed rate debt stated above was 3.80% per annum.  At December 31, 2024, our outstanding variable rate debt totaled $2.1 billion, of which $900.0 million was subject to interest rate swaps.  At December 31, 2024, the weighted-average stated interest rate on our variable rate debt, including the effect of the interest rate swaps, was 4.15% per annum.  If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately $21.0 million, on an annualized basis, for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOur use of derivative instruments also involves certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk, the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract.  We believe that there is a low likelihood that these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations and we minimize our exposure by limiting counterparties to major banks who meet established credit and capital guidelines.

BXP, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of BXP, Inc.’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n \nAs of the end of BXP, Inc.’s 2024 fiscal year, management conducted assessments of the effectiveness of BXP, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on these assessments, management has determined that BXP, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 was effective.\n \nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of BXP, Inc.; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of BXP, Inc.’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.\n \nThe effectiveness of BXP, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report appearing on page \n103\n, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of BXP, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\n102\nTable of Contents\n     \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n \nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BXP, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BXP, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n103\nTable of Contents\n     \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment Assessment\n of Long-Lived Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nAs described in Notes 2, 3, and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total real estate balance was $21,050.3 million and its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was $1,060.1 million as of December 31, 2024. During 2024, the Company recognized a $13.6 million impairment loss related to a long-lived asset and a $341.3 million other-than-temporary impairment loss related to certain investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. This evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period. Management reviews its unconsolidated joint ventures for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and records impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. This evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. Management will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. The fair value of unconsolidated joint ventures is calculated using a discounted cash flow model which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, market interest rates and availability, discount rates, and capitalization rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the assessment of impairment indicators for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management (a) in identifying the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (b) when developing the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture with an other- than- temporary impairment, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to (a) management's identification of the indicators of impairment related to the operating performance and anticipated hold periods for long-lived assets and the performance of each investment and market conditions for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (b) management’s assumptions related to future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates (collectively referred to as “the significant fair value assumptions”), and (iii) the audit effort related to management’s development of the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture with an other-than-temporary impairment involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to (i) the identification of the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (ii) developing the fair value estimate of the unconsolidated investment in joint venture with an other-than-temporary impairment. For the identification of the indicators of impairment, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for identifying the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of the models, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the models, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s indicators of impairment related to the operating performance and anticipated hold periods for long-lived assets and the performance of each investment and market \n104\nTable of Contents\n     \nconditions for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Evaluating the operating performance and anticipated hold periods involved considering the current and past performance of the long-lived assets, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether the indicators were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating performance of each investment and market conditions involved considering changes in the performance of the investments and market conditions and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. For the fair value estimate of the unconsolidated investment in joint venture with an other-than-temporary decline, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture relating to the other-than-temporary impairment, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s discounted cash flow model, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions used by management by considering industry knowledge and data, historical company data, and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions.\nPurchase Price Allocation for Long-Lived Asset Property Acquisitions\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company acquired its joint venture partner’s interest in a property for a purchase price of $10.0 million and a property for a gross purchase price of $35.0 million. Management assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings and improvements, tenant improvements, “above-” and “below-market” leases, leasing costs and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities (including ground leases)) and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. Management assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount, and/or capitalization rates, and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the purchase price allocation for long-lived asset property acquisitions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s significant assumptions related to discount rates and capitalization rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the purchase price allocation for the long-lived asset property acquisition, including controls over the assumptions related to discount rate and capitalization rate used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the corresponding purchase price allocation. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreements and leasing documents for the acquisition, (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s discounted cash flow method, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the method, and, (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management, related to the discount rate, capitalization rate, land value per square foot and future capital requirements by considering industry knowledge and data as well as historical company data and experience. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the discount rate and capitalization rate assumptions.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 27, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.\n105\nTable of Contents\n     \nBXP, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except for share and par value amounts)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nASSETS\nReal estate, at cost (amounts related to variable interest entities (“VIEs”) of $\n7,797,430\n and $\n7,054,075\n at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively)\n$\n27,870,623\n \n$\n26,749,209\n \nRight of use assets -

Boston Properties Limited Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of BXP, Inc. to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Boston Properties Limited Partnership’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAs of the end of Boston Properties Limited Partnership’s 2024 fiscal year, management conducted assessments of the effectiveness of Boston Properties Limited Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on these assessments, management has determined that Boston Properties Limited Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 was effective.\nBoston Properties Limited Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of BXP, Inc.; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Boston Properties Limited Partnership’s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nThe effectiveness of Boston Properties Limited Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report appearing on page \n116\n, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Boston Properties Limited Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\n115\nTable of Contents\n     \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Partners of Boston Properties Limited Partnership\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe\n have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Properties Limited Partnership\n \nand its subsidiaries\n \n(the “Partnership”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,\n \nand the related statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of capital and noncontrolling interests and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).\n \nWe also have audited the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  \nIn our opinion, the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\n, \nand the results of its\n \noperations and its\n \ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024\n \nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Partnership maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Partnership’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\n \nOur responsibility is to express opinions on the Partnership’s consolidated\n \nfinancial statements and on the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable \n116\nTable of Contents\n     \nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment Assessment\n of Long-Lived Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nAs described in Notes 2, 3, and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Partnership’s total real estate balance was $20,814.2 million and its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was $1,060.1 million as of December 31, 2024. During 2024, the Partnership recognized a $13.6 million impairment loss related to a long-lived asset and a $341.3 million other-than-temporary impairment loss related to certain investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. This evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period. Management reviews its unconsolidated joint ventures for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and records impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. This evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. Management will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. The fair value of unconsolidated joint ventures is calculated using a discounted cash flow model which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, market interest rates and availability, discount rates, and capitalization rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the assessment of impairment indicators for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management (a) in identifying the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (b) when developing the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture with an other- than- temporary impairment, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to (a) management's identification of the indicators of impairment related to the operating performance and anticipated hold periods for long-lived assets and the performance of each investment and market conditions for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (b) management’s assumptions related to future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates (collectively referred to as “the significant fair value assumptions”), and (iii) the audit effort related to management’s development of the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture with an other-than-temporary impairment involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to (i) the identification of the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (ii) developing the fair value estimate of the unconsolidated investment in joint venture with an other-than-temporary impairment. For the identification of the indicators of impairment, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for identifying the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, (ii) evaluating the \n117\nTable of Contents\n     \nreasonableness of the models, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the models, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s indicators of impairment related to the operating performance and anticipated hold periods for long-lived assets and the performance of each investment and market conditions for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Evaluating the operating performance and anticipated hold periods involved considering the current and past performance of the long-lived assets, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether the indicators were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating performance of each investment and market conditions involved considering changes in the performance of the investments and market conditions and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. For the fair value estimate of the unconsolidated investment in joint venture with an other-than-temporary decline, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture relating to the other-than-temporary impairment, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s discounted cash flow model, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions used by management by considering industry knowledge and data, historical company data, and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions.\nPurchase Price Allocation for Long-Lived Asset Property Acquisitions\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Partnership acquired its joint venture partner’s interest in a property for a purchase price of $10.0 million and a property for a gross purchase price of $35.0 million. Management assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings and improvements, tenant improvements, “above-” and “below-market” leases, leasing costs and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities (including ground leases)) and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. Management assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount, and/or capitalization rates, and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the purchase price allocation for long-lived asset property acquisitions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s significant assumptions related to discount rates and capitalization rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the purchase price allocation for the long-lived asset property acquisition, including controls over the assumptions related to discount rate and capitalization rate used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the corresponding purchase price allocation. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreements and leasing documents for the acquisition, (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s discounted cash flow method, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the method, and, (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management, related to the discount rate, capitalization rate, land value per square foot and future capital requirements by considering industry knowledge and data as well as historical company data and experience. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the discount rate and capitalization rate assumptions.\n \n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 27, 2025\nWe have served as the Partnership’s auditor since 1997.\n118\nTable of Contents\n     \nBOSTON PROPERTIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except for unit amounts)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nASSETS\nReal estate, at cost (amounts related to variable interest entities (“VIEs”) of $\n7,797,430\n and $\n7,054,075\n at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively)\n$\n27,504,358\n \n$\n26,382,944\n \nRight of use assets -

AND BOSTON PROPERTIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Organization \nBXP is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT.  BXP is the sole general partner of BPLP, its operating partnership, and at December 31, 2024, owned an approximate \n89.7\n% (\n89.4\n% at December 31, 2023) general and limited partnership interest in BPLP.  Unless stated otherwise or the context requires, the “Company” refers to BXP and its subsidiaries, including BPLP and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Partnership interests in BPLP include:\n•\ncommon units of partnership interest (also referred to as “OP Units”) and \n•\nlong term incentive units of partnership interest (also referred to as “LTIP Units”) \nUnless specifically noted otherwise, all references to OP Units exclude units held by BXP.  A holder of an OP Unit may present the OP Unit to BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally \none\n year from issuance).  Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, BPLP is obligated to redeem the OP Unit for cash equal to the value of a share of common stock of BXP (“Common Stock”).  In lieu of such cash redemption, BXP may elect to acquire the OP Unit for \none\n share of Common Stock.  Because the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that BXP owns, \none\n share of Common Stock is generally the economic equivalent of \none\n OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of Common Stock.  \nThe Company uses LTIP Units as a form of time-based, restricted equity compensation and as a form of performance-based equity compensation for employees, and it has previously granted LTIP Units in the form of (1) 2012 outperformance plan awards (“2012 OPP Units”) and (2) 2013 - 2024 multi-year, long-term incentive program awards (also referred to as “MYLTIP Units”), each of which, upon the satisfaction of certain performance-based and time-based vesting conditions, is convertible into \none\n OP Unit.  The \nthree\n-year measurement periods for the 2012 OPP Units and the 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units have ended and BXP’s total stockholder return (“TSR”) was sufficient for employees to earn and therefore become eligible to vest in a portion of the awards.  Unless and until they are earned, the rights, preferences and privileges of the 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units differ from other LTIP Units granted to employees (including the 2012 OPP Units and the 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units, which have been earned).  Therefore, unless specifically noted otherwise, all references to LTIP Units exclude the 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units.  LTIP Units (including the earned 2012 OPP Units and the earned 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units), whether vested or not, receive the same quarterly per unit distributions as OP Units, which equal per share dividends on Common Stock (See Notes 10, 15 and 17). \nProperties\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of \n185\n commercial real estate properties (the “Properties”) aggregating approximately \n53.3\n million net rentable square feet of primarily office properties, including \nseven\n properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately \n2.3\n million net rentable square feet.  At December 31, 2024, the Properties consisted of:\n•\n163\n office and life sciences properties (including \nfive\n properties under construction/redevelopment);\n•\n14\n retail properties (including \none\n property under construction); \n•\nseven\n residential properties (including \none\n property under construction); and\n•\none\n hotel.\nAll references to acres and square feet in the Notes are unaudited. \nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented using the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).  BXP does not have any other significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its investment in BPLP, nor does it have employees of its own.  BPLP, not BXP, generally executes all significant business relationships other than transactions involving securities of BXP.  All majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures over which the Company has financial and operating control and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary are included in the consolidated financial statements.  All significant intercompany balances \n128\nTable of Contents\n     \nand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Company accounts for all other unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting.  Accordingly, the Company’s share of the earnings of these joint ventures and companies is included in consolidated net income.\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nConsolidated VIEs are those for which the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE.  The primary beneficiary is the entity that has a controlling financial interest in the VIE, which is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the VIE’s performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the returns from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  The assets of each VIE are only available to satisfy such VIE's respective liabilities.  The Company has identified \nnine\n entities that are VIEs as of December 31, 2024 and has determined that it is the primary beneficiary for all of these entities as of December 31, 2024.\nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, BXP has identified \nnine\n consolidated VIEs, including BPLP.  Excluding BPLP, the consolidated VIEs consisted of (i) the following \nsix\n in-service properties: 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building), 7 Times Square (formerly Times Square Tower), 601 Lexington Avenue, Atlantic Wharf Office Building, 100 Federal Street and 300 Binney Street, (ii) 343 Madison Avenue, which is categorized as land held for future development and (iii) 290 Binney Street, which is currently under development.\nThe Company consolidates these VIEs because it is the primary beneficiary.  The third parties’ interests in these consolidated entities (excluding BPLP’s interest) are reflected as noncontrolling interests in property partnerships in the accompanying consolidated financial statements (See Note 10).  \nIn addition, BXP’s only significant asset is its investment in BPLP and, consequently, substantially all of BXP’s assets and liabilities are the assets and liabilities of BPLP. \nVariable Interest Entities Not Consolidated\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company does \nnot\n have any unconsolidated joint ventures that are classified as VIEs.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nReal Estate\n \nUpon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses whether the transaction should be accounted for as an asset acquisition or as a business combination by applying a screen to determine whether the integrated set of assets and activities acquired meets the definition of a business.  Acquisitions of integrated sets of assets and activities that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions.  The Company’s acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate generally will not meet the definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e. land, buildings, and related intangible assets) or because the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay.  \nThe Company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, “above-” and “below-market” leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities (including ground leases)) and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant.  The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that it deems appropriate, as well as available market information.  Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. \nThe fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant.  The Company also considers an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants’ credit quality and expectations of lease \n129\nTable of Contents\n     \nrenewals.  Based on its acquisitions to date, the Company’s allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.\n \nThe Company records acquired “above-” and “below-market” leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.  Acquired “above-” and “below-market” lease values have been reflected within Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively, in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on the Company’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease.  Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases.  In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions.  In estimating costs to execute similar leases, the Company considers leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.\n \nManagement reviews its long-lived assets \nfor indicators of imp\nairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  This evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, it is more likely than not, that a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period.  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.  The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates.  Any or all of such assumptions could differ materially from actual results in future periods.  Because cash flows on properties considered to be “long-lived assets to be held and used” are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset may be impaired, the Company’s established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss.  If the Company’s hold strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate a shorter hold, an impairment loss may be recognized, and such loss could be material.  If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.\n  \nAt March 31, 2024, the Company evaluated the expected hold period for a portion of its Shady Grove property, consisting of 2 Choke Cherry Road, 2094 Gaither Road and a land parcel, located in Rockville, Maryland.  Based on a shorter-than-expected hold period, the Company reduced the carrying value of a portion of the property that the Company anticipates selling to a third-party developer to its estimated fair value at March 31, 2024.  As a result, each of BXP and BPLP recognized an impairment loss of approximately $\n13.6\n million during the year ended December 31, 2024 (See Note 3).\nGuidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360 “Property Plant and Equipment” requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as “held for sale,” be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and the Company will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale.  Discontinued operations presentation applies only to disposals representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results (e.g., a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity).  The components of the property’s net income that are reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan).  The Company generally considers assets to be “held for sale” when the transaction has been approved by BXP’s Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that a sale of the property within one year is considered probable.  Following the classification of a property as “held for sale,” no further depreciation is recorded on the assets, and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value, less cost to sell.  \nReal estate is stated at depreciated cost.  A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties.  The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs.  The Company capitalizes acquisition costs that it incurs to effect an asset acquisition and expenses acquisition costs that it incurs to effect a business combination, including legal, due diligence and other closing related costs.  Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized.  Capitalized \n130\nTable of Contents\n     \ndevelopment costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development.  After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of the project that benefited from the investment.  Determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease, involves a degree of judgment.  The Company’s capitalization policy on development properties follows the guidance in ASC 835-20 “Capitalization of Interest” and ASC 970 “Real Estate-General.”  The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. \nCapitalized costs include pre-construction costs necessary to the development of the property, development costs (including architectural, engineering and design costs), construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development.  The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which it defines as activities that are necessary for the development of the property.  The Company considers a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity.  The Company ceases capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed, (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction or (3) if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended.  Interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $\n42.0\n million, $\n42.6\n million and $\n52.1\n million, respectively.  Salaries and related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $\n17.2\n million, $\n16.1\n million and $\n16.1\n million, respectively.\n \nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred.  Significant betterments are capitalized.  When assets are sold or retired, their costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses reflected in net income or loss for the period.\n \nThe Company computes depreciation and amortization on properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives.  The Company allocates the acquisition cost of real estate to its components and depreciates or amortizes these assets (or liabilities) over their useful lives.  The amortization of acquired “above-” and “below-market” leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \nDepreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\n \nLand improvements\n  \n25\n to \n40\n years\nBuildings and improvements\n  \n10\n to \n40\n years\nTenant improvements\n  \nShorter of useful life or terms of related lease\nFurniture, fixtures, and equipment\n  \n3\n to \n10\n years\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n \nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase.  The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit of $\n250,000\n.\n \nCash Held in Escrows\nEscrows include amounts established pursuant to various agreements for security deposits, property taxes, insurance and other costs.  Escrows also include cash held by qualified intermediaries for possible investments in like-kind exchanges in accordance with Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”), in connection with sales of the Company’s properties.\n \nInvestments in Securities\n \nThe Company accounts for investments in equity securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings.  The Company maintains deferred compensation plans that are designed to allow officers and non-employee directors of BXP to defer a portion of the officer’s current income or the non-employee director’s current compensation on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer or non-employee director.  The Company’s obligation under the plans is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the plan participants in the future.\n  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had maintained approximately $\n39.4\n \n131\nTable of Contents\n     \nmillion and $\n36.1\n million, respectively, in separate accounts, that are not restricted as to their use.  The Company recognized gains (losses) of approximately $\n4.4\n million, $\n5.6\n million and $(\n6.5\n) million on its investments in the accounts associated with the Company’s deferred compensation plans during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company follows ASC 320, ”Investment–Debt and Equity Securities” (“ASC 320”) which requires that debt and equity securities be classified into one of three categories: held to maturity, trading securities or available for sale.  At December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding \nthree\n-month United States Treasury Bills with a maturity date of January 30, 2024 that were classified as held to maturity because the Company determined that it had the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity.  Because these securities were considered a short-term investment, they are reflected at amortized cost within Cash and Cash Equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of these securities was approximately $\n302.7\n million.  There were \nno\n such securities outstanding at December 31, 2024.\nNon-Real Estate Investments\nThe Company measures its investments in non-real estate investments, which are primarily environmentally focused investment funds, at the readily determinable fair value of the investment. Changes in the fair value of these non-real estate investments are included in unrealized gain (loss) on non-real estate investments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company’s investment in non-real estate investments is shown within Prepaid and Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and was approximately $\n7.1\n million and $\n4.6\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The Company recognized a net unrealized gain (loss) of approximately $\n0.5\n million, $\n0.2\n million and $(\n0.2\n) million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, due to the observable changes in fair value.\nTenant and Other Receivables\nTenant and other accounts receivable, other than accrued rents receivable, are expected to be collected within \none\n year.\nNotes Receivables\nThe Company accounts for notes receivables at their unamortized cost, net of any unamortized deferred fees or costs, premiums or discounts and an allowance for credit losses.  Loan fees and direct costs associated with loans originated by the Company are deferred and amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the note as interest income.\n \nDeferred Charges\nDeferred charges include leasing costs and certain financing fees.  Leasing costs include acquired intangible in-place lease values and direct and incremental fees and costs incurred in the successful negotiation of leases, including brokerage and other costs which have been deferred and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases.  Unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense upon the early termination of the lease.  Fully amortized deferred leasing costs are removed from the books upon the expiration of the lease.  Financing fees included in deferred charges consist of external fees and costs incurred to obtain the Company’s revolving facility and commercial paper and if applicable, unsecured term loans and construction financing arrangements where there are not sufficient amounts outstanding to report the fees net of the debt liability.  Such financing costs have been deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the respective financing and included within interest expense.  Unamortized financing costs are charged to expense upon the early repayment or significant modification of the financing.  Fully amortized deferred financing costs are removed from the books upon the maturity of the debt.  \nExternal fees and costs incurred to obtain mortgage financings and unsecured senior notes have been deferred and are presented as direct deductions from the carrying amounts of the corresponding debt liability.  Such financing costs are being amortized over the terms of the respective financing and included within interest expense.  Unamortized financing costs are charged to expense upon the early repayment or significant modification of the financing.\n \n132\nTable of Contents\n     \nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\n \nThe Company consolidates VIEs in which it is considered to be the primary beneficiary.  VIEs are entities in which the equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their endeavors without additional financial support or that the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have substantive participating rights.  The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entity’s performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive the returns from the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  For ventures that are not VIEs, the Company consolidates entities for which it has significant decision making control over the ventures’ operations.  The Company’s judgment with respect to its level of influence or control of an entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of the Company’s ownership interest, its representation in the entity’s governance, the size of its investment (including loans), estimates of future cash flows, its ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace the Company as manager and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable.  The Company’s assessment of its influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  In addition to evaluating control rights, the Company consolidates entities in which the outside partner has no substantive kick-out rights to remove the Company as the managing member.\n \nAccounts of the consolidated entity are included in the accounts of the Company and the noncontrolling interest is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of equity or in temporary equity between liabilities and equity.  Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are recorded initially at cost, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions.  Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset.  Under the equity method of accounting, the net equity investment of the Company is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the Company’s share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses; however, the Company’s recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture’s distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds.  The Company may account for cash distributions in excess of its investment in an unconsolidated joint venture as income when the Company is not the general partner in a limited partnership and when the Company has neither the requirement nor the intent to provide financial support to the joint venture.  The Company classifies distributions received from equity method investees within its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows using the nature of the distribution approach, which classifies the distributions received on the basis of the nature of the activity or activities of the investee that generated the distribution as either a return on investment (classified as cash inflows from operating activities) or a return of investment (classified as cash inflows from investing activities).  \nThe Company’s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and the Company records impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary.  This evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions.  The Company will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary.  The fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, debt interest rates and availability, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods.  During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss on its investments in \nthree\n, \nfour\n and \none\n joint ventures, respectively, totaling approximately $\n341.3\n million, $\n272.6\n million and  $\n50.7\n million, respectively.  For a description of the other-than-temporary impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, see Note 6.\nTo the extent that the Company contributed assets to a joint venture, the Company’s investment in the joint venture was recorded at the Company’s fair value basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture.  To the extent that the Company’s fair value basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in the Company’s share of equity in net income of the joint venture.  In accordance with the provisions of ASC 610-20 “Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets” (“ASC 610-20”), the Company will recognize a full gain on both the retained and sold portions \n133\nTable of Contents\n     \nof real estate contributed or sold to a joint venture by recognizing its new equity method investment interest at fair value.\nThe combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in Note 6.\n \nRevenue Recognition\nIn general, the Company commences lease/rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  Contractual lease/rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases.  Therefore, the Company recognizes non-cash revenue each reporting period (i.e., the sum of all contractual lease/rental payments due over the term of the lease divided by the number of years in the term).  The impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased revenue by approximately $\n105.6\n million, $\n99.1\n million and $\n108.0\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as the lease/rental revenue recorded exceeded amounts billed.  Accrued rental income, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents cumulative lease/rental income earned in excess of rent payments received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements.  \nThe Company must estimate the collectability of its accrued rent and accounts receivable balances related to lease revenue.  \nWhen evaluating the collectability of \ntenants\n’ accrued rent and accounts receivable balances, management considers \ntenants’\n creditworthiness, public statements made by the tenant, current economic trends and changes in \ntenants\n’ payment patterns,\n on a lease-by-lease basis.  The Company writes-off the tenant’s receivable balance, including the accrued rent receivable, if the Company considers the balances no longer probable of collection.  In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims.  If the Company deems the balances no longer probable of collection, the Company writes them off and ceases recognizing lease income, including straight-line rent, unless cash is received.  Following a write-off, if (1) the Company subsequently determines that it is probable it will collect substantially all the remaining lessee’s lease payments under the lease term and (2) the lease has not been modified since the write-off, the Company will then reinstate the accrued rent and accounts receivable write-offs, adjusting for the amount related to the period when the lease payments were considered not probable of collection.  If the Company’s estimates of collectability differs from the cash received, then the timing and amount of the Company’s reported revenue could be impacted.  The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of the Company’s existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants’ risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of the Company’s portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.\nThe Company recognizes acquired in-place “above-” and “below-market” leases at their fair values as rental revenue over the original term of the respective leases.  Acquired “above-” and “below-market” lease values have been reflected within Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The impact of the acquired in-place “above-” and “below-market” leases increased revenue by approximately $\n5.5\n million, $\n19.2\n million and $\n9.1\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nThe following table summarizes the scheduled amortization of the Company’s acquired “above-” and “below-market” lease intangibles for each of the five succeeding years (in thousands). \nAcquired Above-Market Lease Intangibles\nAcquired Below-Market Lease Intangibles\n2025\n$\n2,328\n \n$\n9,982\n \n2026\n1,236\n \n8,862\n \n2027\n928\n \n5,648\n \n2028\n781\n \n2,419\n \n2029\n729\n \n914\n \nRecoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred (See “\nLeases”\n  below).  The Company receives reimbursements of payroll and payroll-related costs from unconsolidated joint venture entities and third-party property owners in connection with management services contracts which the Company reflects on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as the Company has determined that it is the principal and not the agent under these arrangements in accordance with the guidance in ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). \n134\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe Company’s parking revenue is derived primarily from monthly and transient daily parking.  In addition, the Company has certain lease arrangements for parking accounted for under the guidance in ASC 842 “Leases” (“ASC 842”).  The monthly and transient daily parking revenue falls within the scope of ASC 606 and is accounted for at the point in time when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer and the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied.\nRevenue from the Company’s View Boston observatory at The Prudential Center (which is included within Parking and Other Revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Operations) is derived from ticket, special event, food and beverage and merchandise sales.  The revenue is recognized when the ticket is used by the purchaser or the special event occurs and when the food and beverage and merchandise are sold.\nThe Company’s hotel revenue is derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services.  Hotel revenue is recognized as the hotel rooms are occupied and the services are rendered to the hotel customers.\nThe Company earns management and development fees.  Development and management services revenue is earned from unconsolidated joint venture entities and third-party property owners.  The Company determined that the performance obligations associated with its development services contracts are satisfied over time and that the Company would recognize its development services revenue under the output method evenly over time from the development commencement date through the substantial completion date of the development management services project due to the stand-ready nature of the contracts.  Significant judgments impacting the amount and timing of revenue recognized from the Company’s development services contracts include estimates of total development project costs from which the fees are typically derived and estimates of the period of time until substantial completion of the development project, the period of time over which the development services are required to be performed.  The Company recognizes development fees earned from unconsolidated joint venture projects equal to its cost plus profit to the extent of the third party partners’ ownership interest.  Property management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents.\nGains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 610-20.  Under ASC 610-20, the Company must first determine whether the transaction is a sale to a customer or non-customer.  The Company typically sells real estate on a selective basis and not within the ordinary course of its business and therefore expects that its sale transactions will not be contracts with customers.  The Company next determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in the property after the sale, consistent with the consolidation model in ASC 810 “Consolidation” (“ASC 810”).  If the Company determines that it does not have a controlling financial interest in the real estate, it evaluates whether a contract exists under ASC 606 and whether the buyer has obtained control of the asset that was sold.  The Company recognizes a full gain on sale of real estate when the derecognition criteria under ASC 610-20 have been met.\nLeases\nLessee\nFor leases in which the Company is the lessee (generally ground leases), in accordance with ASC 842 the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.  The Company made the policy election to not apply the requirements of ASC 842 to short-term leases.  This policy election is made by class of underlying assets and as described below, the Company considers real estate to be a class of underlying assets, and will not be further delineating it into specific uses of the real estate asset as the risk profiles are similar in nature.  For operating leases, the Company will recognize the lease payments it pays in net income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  For finance leases, the Company will recognize interest expense.\nThe lease liability is equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments in accordance with ASC 842.  The Company will use its incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) to determine the net present value of the minimum lease payments.  In order to determine the IBR, the Company utilized a market-based approach to estimate the incremental borrowing rate for each individual lease.  The approach required significant judgment.  Therefore, the Company utilized different data sets to estimate base IBRs via an analysis of the following weighted-components:  \n•\nthe interpolated rates from yields on outstanding U.S. Treasury issuances for up to 30 years and for years 31 and beyond, longer-term publicly traded educational institution debt issued by high credit quality educational institutions with maturity dates exceeding 31 years, \n•\nobservable mortgage rates spread over U.S. Treasury issuances, and \n135\nTable of Contents\n     \n•\nunlevered property yields and discount rates. \nThe Company then applied adjustments to account for considerations related to term and interpolated the IBR.\n \nLessor\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases primarily office, life sciences, retail and residential space to tenants.  These leases may contain extension and termination options that are predominately at the sole discretion of the tenant, provided certain conditions are satisfied.  In a few instances, the leases also provide the tenants with options to purchase the underlying asset, which would be exercisable at fair market value.  Also, certain of the Company’s retail leases include rental payments that are based on a percentage of the tenant sales in excess of contractual amounts. \n Per ASC 842, lessors do not need to separate nonlease components from the associated lease component if certain criteria are met for each class of underlying assets.  The guidance in ASC 842 defines “underlying asset” as “an asset that is the subject of a lease for which a right to use that asset has been conveyed to a lessee.  The underlying asset could be a physically distinct portion of a single asset.”  The Company considers real estate assets as a class of underlying assets and will not be further delineating it into specific uses of the real estate asset as the risk profiles are similar in nature.  \nLease components are elements of an arrangement that provide the customer with the right to use an identified asset.  Nonlease components are distinct elements of a contract that are not related to securing the use of the leased asset and revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606.  The Company considers common area maintenance (CAM) and service income associated with tenant work orders to be nonlease components because they represent delivery of a separate service but are not considered a cost of securing the identified asset.  In the case of the Company’s business, the identified asset would be the leased real estate (office, life sciences, retail or residential).   \nThe Company assessed and concluded that the timing and pattern of transfer for nonlease components and the associated lease component are the same.  The Company determined that the predominant component was the lease component and as such its leases will continue to qualify as operating leases and the Company has made a policy election to account for and present the lease component and the nonlease component as a single component in the revenue section of the Consolidated Statements of Operations labeled Lease.  \nRecoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred\n.  \nThe Company recognizes these reimbursements on a gross basis, as the Company obtains control of the goods and services before they are transferred to the tenant.   \nIn addition, in accordance with ASC 842, lessors will only capitalize incremental direct leasing costs.\nSales-Type Leases\nSales-type lease receivables are recognized when a lease qualifies as a sales-type lease.  The sales-type lease receivable is initially measured at the present value of the fixed and determinable lease payments, including any guaranteed or unguaranteed residual value of the asset at the end of the lease, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease.  The Company evaluates its sales-type lease receivable for impairment under the current expected credit loss standard.  Interest income is recognized under the effective interest method.  The effective interest method produces a constant yield on the sales-type lease receivable over the term of the lease.  Income from these leases are classified as Lease Revenue within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n \nEarnings Per Share \nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available, as adjusted for undistributed earnings (if any) of certain securities issued by BPLP, by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year.  Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from shares issuable in connection with awards under stock-based compensation plans, including upon the exercise of stock options, and securities of BPLP that are exchangeable for Common Stock.\n136\nTable of Contents\n     \nEarnings Per Common Unit\nBasic earnings per common unit is computed by dividing net income available, as adjusted for undistributed earnings (if any) of certain securities issued by BPLP, by the weighted average number of common units outstanding during the year.  Diluted earnings per common unit reflects the potential dilution that could occur from units issuable in connection with awards under BXP’s stock-based compensation plans, including upon the exercise of stock options, and conversion of preferred units of BPLP.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements when valuing its financial instruments for disclosure purposes.  The table below presents for December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the financial instruments that are being valued for disclosure purposes, as well as the Level at which they are categorized as defined in ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”)\n. \nFinancial Instrument\nLevel\n3-Month United States treasury bills\nLevel 1\nUnsecured commercial paper\nLevel 1\nInvestment in securities (1)\nLevel 1\nUnsecured senior notes (2)\nLevel 1\nRelated party note receivable\nLevel 3\nNotes receivable\nLevel 3\nSales-type lease receivable\nLevel 3\nMortgage notes payable\nLevel 3\nUnsecured line of credit\nLevel 3\nUnsecured term loan\nLevel 3\n_______________\n(1)\nSee “Investments in Securities” policy above, in this Note 2, for information on its fair values.\n(2)\nIf trading volume for the period is low, the valuation could be categorized as Level 2.\n \nBecause the Company’s valuations of its financial instruments are based on the above Levels and involve the use of estimates, the actual fair values of its financial instruments may differ materially from those estimates.  In addition, the Company’s estimated fair values for these instruments as of the end of the applicable reporting period are not projections of, nor necessarily indicative of, estimated or actual fair values in future reporting periods.  \nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding \nthree\n-month United States Treasury Bills with a maturity date of January 30, 2024, that were classified as held to maturity because the Company determined that it had the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity.  Because these securities are considered short-term investments, they are reflected at amortized cost within Cash and Cash Equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of these securities were approximately $\n302.7\n million. \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had $\n500.0\n million outstanding under its unsecured commercial paper program (See Note 7).  Due to their short-term maturity and stated interest rates at approximate current market rates, the fair value of outstanding commercial paper borrowings approximates the Company's carrying amount at December 31, 2024.\nThe Company’s investment in non-real estate investments is shown within Prepaid and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and was approximately $\n7.1\n million and $\n4.6\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The non-real estate investments utilize net asset value as a practical expedient.\nNon-Recurring Fair Value \nThe following table presents the aggregate carrying value of the Company’s non-recurring fair value financial instruments and the Company’s corresponding estimate of fair value as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n137\nTable of Contents\n     \n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nCarrying\nAmount\nEstimated\nFair Value\nCarrying\nAmount\nEstimated\nFair Value\n3-Month United States Treasury Bills (1)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n302,746\n \n$\n302,746\n \nRelated party note receivable, net\n$\n88,779\n \n$\n89,213\n \n$\n88,779\n \n$\n90,593\n \nNote receivable, net\n4,947\n \n6,187\n \n1,714\n \n1,677\n \nSales-type lease receivable, net\n14,657\n \n13,632\n \n13,704\n \n13,338\n \nTotal\n$\n108,383\n \n$\n109,032\n \n$\n104,197\n \n$\n105,608\n \nMortgage notes payable, net\n$\n4,276,609\n \n$\n3,808,095\n \n$\n4,166,379\n \n$\n3,705,513\n \nUnsecured senior notes, net\n10,645,077\n \n10,005,606\n \n10,491,617\n \n9,697,393\n \nUnsecured line of credit\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nUnsecured term loan, net\n798,813\n \n799,580\n \n1,198,301\n \n1,196,945\n \nUnsecured commercial paper\n500,000\n \n500,000\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n16,220,499\n \n$\n15,113,281\n \n$\n15,856,297\n \n$\n14,599,851\n \n_______________\n(1)  Per the guidance in ASC 326, the Company concluded that the risk of nonpayment is nonexistent because the U.S. Government has a long history with no credit losses and therefore, no credit loss allowance was recorded.\n \nRecurring Fair Value\nIn addition to the financial instruments noted above, the Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk (See Note 8).  The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves.  To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, the Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.  Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.  The Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives.  As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements is shown within Prepaid and Other Assets or Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  \nThe following table presents the aggregate fair value of the Company’s interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nFair value\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nInterest rate swaps\n$\n5,252\n \n$\n1,976\n \nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nDerivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges.  These judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivative’s effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity.  In general, the Company accounts for both the effective and ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative in other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassifies the fair value of the derivative to earnings over the term that the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the same line item as the hedged transaction within the statements of operatio\nns.  \n138\nTable of Contents\n     \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, to satisfy a lender requirement, the Company entered into \ntwo\n agreements with the same third-party to purchase and sell a $\n600.0\n million interest rate cap.  The Company did not elect hedge accounting and as such any change in market value will be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The Company recognized a loss from interest rate contracts of approximately $\n79,000\n for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to the observable changes in fair value of these derivatives.  The Company did \nnot\n recognize any losses during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n \nStock-Based Employee Compensation Plans\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had a stock-based employee compensation plan.  The Company accounts for the plan under the guidance in ASC 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”), which revised the fair value based method of accounting for share-based payment liabilities, forfeitures and modifications of stock-based awards and clarified previous guidance in several areas, including measuring fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods.\n \nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  These estimates include such items as depreciation and allowances for doubtful accounts.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it considers to be reasonable under the circumstances, including the impact of extraordinary events such as a pandemic, the results of which form the basis for making significant judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, assessments of future collectability, and other areas of the financial statements that are impacted by the use of estimates.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nBXP\nEquity Offering Costs\n  \nUnderwriting commissions and offering costs have been reflected as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.\n \nTreasury Stock\n  \nBXP’s share repurchases are reflected as treasury stock utilizing the cost method of accounting and are presented as a reduction to consolidated stockholders’ equity.\n \nDividends\n  \nEarnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to stockholders, will differ from income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal income tax purposes in the treatment of gains/losses on the sale of real property, revenue and expense recognition, compensation expense, and in the estimated useful lives and basis used to compute depreciation.\n \nThe tax treatment of common dividends per share for federal income tax purposes is as follows: \n \nFor the year ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nPer Share\n%\nPer Share\n%\nPer Share\n%\nOrdinary income\n$\n3.22\n \n88.29\n \n%\n$\n3.04\n \n72.98\n \n%\n$\n3.42\n \n86.60\n \n%\nCapital gain income\n0.03\n \n0.79\n \n%\n1.12\n \n27.02\n \n%\n0.53\n \n13.40\n \n%\nReturn of capital\n0.40\n \n10.92\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\nTotal\n$\n3.65\n \n(1)\n100.00\n \n%\n$\n4.16\n \n(2)\n100.00\n \n%\n$\n3.95\n \n(3)\n100.00\n \n%\n \n_____________\n(1)\nThe fourth quarter 2024 regular quarterly dividend was $\n0.98\n per common share, all of which were allocable to 2025.\n(2)\nThe fourth quarter 2023 regular quarterly dividend was $\n0.98\n per common share, of which approximately $\n0.27\n per common share was allocated to 2023 and approximately $\n0.71\n per common share was allocated to 2024.\n(3)\nThe fourth quarter 2022 regular quarterly dividend was $\n0.98\n per common share, of which approximately $\n0.03\n per common share was allocated to 2022 and approximately $\n0.95\n per common share was allocated to 2023.\n139\nTable of Contents\n     \nIncome Taxes\n \nBXP has elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1997.  As a result, it generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.  A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least \n90\n% of its annual taxable income (with certain adjustments).  BXP’s policy is to distribute at least \n100\n% of its taxable income.  Accordingly, the only provision for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to BXP’s consolidated taxable REIT subsidiaries.  BXP’s taxable REIT subsidiaries did not have significant tax provisions or deferred income tax items.  BXP has no uncertain tax positions recognized as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  At December 31, 2024, BXP’s tax returns for 2021 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations.\nThe Company owns a hotel property that it leases to one of its taxable REIT subsidiaries and that is managed by Marriott International, Inc.  The hotel taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to the lease for the hotel property.  As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of a management agreement.  The hotel taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to tax at the federal and state level and, accordingly, if applicable, BXP has recorded a tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \nCertain entities included in BXP’s consolidated financial statements are subject to certain state and local taxes.  These taxes are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n \nBPLP\nIncome Taxes\n \nThe partners are required to report their respective share of BPLP’s taxable income or loss on their respective tax returns and are liable for any related taxes thereon.  Accordingly, the only provision for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to BPLP’s consolidated taxable REIT subsidiaries.  BPLP’s taxable REIT subsidiaries did not have significant tax provisions or deferred income tax items.  BPLP has no uncertain tax positions recognized as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  At December 31, 2024, BPLP’s tax returns for 2021 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under the statute of limitations.\nThe Company owns a hotel property which is managed through a taxable REIT subsidiary.  The hotel taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to the lease for the hotel property.  As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property.  Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of a management agreement.  The hotel taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to tax at the federal and state level and, accordingly, if applicable, BPLP has recorded a tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nCertain entities included in BPLP’s consolidated financial statements are subject to certain state and local taxes.  These taxes are recorded as operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAdopted New Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”).  ASU 2023-07 improves reportable segment disclosure requirements for public business entities primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit (referred to as the “significant expense principle”).  ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted this accounting standard on \nJanuary 1, 2024\n.  While the adoption has no impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, it has resulted in incremental disclosures within the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements (See Note 12). \n140\nTable of Contents\n     \nIn August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, “Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60)” (“ASU 2023-05”).  ASU 2023-05 is intended to (1) address accounting for contributions made to a joint venture upon formation and (2) reduce diversity in practice.  This ASU will apply to joint ventures that meet the definition of a corporate joint venture under GAAP, thus limiting its scope to joint ventures not controlled and therefore not consolidated by any joint venture investor.  This accounting standard is effective for joint ventures with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025.  The Company adopted this ASU on \nJanuary 1, 2025\n.\nNewly Issued Accounting Pronouncements \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)” (“ASU 2024-03”): ASU 2024-03 will require entities to provide enhanced disclosures related to certain expense categories included in income statement captions.  The ASU aims to increase transparency and provide investors with more detailed information about the nature of expenses reported on the face of the income statement.  The new standard does not change the requirements for the presentation of expenses on the face of the income statement.  Under this ASU, entities are required to disaggregate, in a tabular format, expense captions presented on the face of the income statement — excluding earnings or losses from equity method investments — if they include any of the following expense categories: purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation or depletion.  For any remaining items within each relevant expense caption, entities must provide a qualitative description of the nature of those expenses.  The new ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU 2024-03 may have on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes.\n \n3.

At acquisition, the total net equity acquired was $\n20.0\n million, which includes $\n10.0\n million in cash that the Company paid for the joint venture partner's \n50\n% economic ownership interest in the joint venture.  The property is subject to existing mortgage indebtedness of approximately $\n207.1\n million (See Note 7).  The acquisition resulted in the Company recording a gain upon consolidation of approximately $\n21.8\n million, which is the difference between the fair value of the previously held equity method investment immediately prior to the consolidation of $\n10.0\n million, less the Company’s costs basis of approximately $(\n11.8\n) million.  The gain on consolidation is included within loss from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  \nThe total net assets acquired is equal to (1) the total net equity acquired of $\n20.0\n million, which includes $\n10.0\n million in cash that the Company paid for the joint venture partner's \n50\n% economic ownership interest in the joint venture plus (2) $\n207.1\n million of debt assumed, less (3) net working capital acquired of approximately $\n7.1\n million.  \nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the fair value of the net assets the Company received at the date of acquisition for 901 New York Avenue (in thousands):\nLand and site improvements\n$\n65,808\n \nBuilding and improvements\n56,882\n \nTenant improvements\n16,088\n \nIn-place lease intangibles\n72,621\n \nAbove-market lease intangibles\n2,757\n \nBelow-market lease intangibles\n(\n2,515\n)\nMortgage note payable adjustment\n8,374\n \nNet assets acquired\n$\n220,015\n \nThe following table summarizes the estimated annual amortization of the acquired in-place lease intangibles, and the acquired above- and below-market lease intangibles for 901 New York Avenue as of the acquisition date for each of the five succeeding fiscal years (in thousands):\n142\nTable of Contents\n     \nAcquired In-Place Lease Intangibles \nAcquired Above-Market Lease Intangibles \nAcquired Below-Market Lease Intangibles\n2025\n$\n9,030\n \n$\n454\n \n$\n257\n \n2026\n6,494\n \n238\n \n257\n \n2027\n6,265\n \n201\n \n257\n \n2028\n6,069\n \n186\n \n257\n \n2029\n6,076\n \n186\n \n251\n \nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average useful life of the acquired in-place lease intangibles and the acquired above- and below-market lease intangibles for 901 New York Avenue as of the acquisition date (in years):\nAcquired In-Place Lease Intangibles \nAcquired Above-Market Lease Intangibles \nAcquired Below-Market Lease Intangibles\nWeighted-average useful life\n6.7\n4.0\n9.8\n901 New York Avenue contributed approximately $\n33.2\n million of revenue and $\n9.4\n million of net loss to the Company for the period from January 8, 2024 through December 31, 2024.  901 New York Avenue is an office property consisting of approximately \n508,000\n net rentable square feet.\nOn December 27, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of 725 12th Street, an approximately \n300,000\n net rentable square foot, \n12\n-story office property located in Washington, DC, for a purchase price, excluding transaction costs, of $\n34.0\n million.  The acquisition was completed with available cash.  Following the acquisition, the Company commenced redevelopment of the property and therefore did not contribute any income to the Company for the period from December 27, 2024 to December 31, 2024.  When completed, 725 12th Street is expected to total approximately \n320,000\n net rentable square feet of office and retail space.  \nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price, including transactions costs, of 725 12th Street (in thousands):\nLand and site improvements\n$\n26,997\n \nBuilding and improvements\n8,369\n \nNet assets acquired\n$\n35,366\n \nDevelopment\nOn February 12, 2024, the Company commenced the development of a residential project at 121 Broadway Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts that is adjacent to its development projects at 290 Binney Street and 300 Binney Street.  121 Broadway will consist of \n439\n residential units aggregating approximately \n492,000\n net rentable square feet.  There can be no assurance that the Company will complete development of the project on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company completed and fully placed in-service 760 Boylston Street, an approximately \n118,000\n net rentable square foot retail redevelopment located in Boston, Massachusetts.  \nOn July 17, 2024, the Company partially placed in-service Reston Next Office Phase II, an approximately \n90,000\n net rentable square foot development project comprised of office and retail space located in Reston, Virginia.  \nOn September 26, 2024, the Company fully placed in-service 180 CityPoint, an approximately \n329,000\n net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project located in Waltham, Massachusetts.  \nOn October 5, 2024, the Company fully placed in-service 103 CityPoint, an approximately \n113,000\n net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project located in Waltham, Massachusetts.\nOn October 31, 2024, the Company completed and fully placed in-service 300 Binney Street, a laboratory/life sciences redevelopment project with approximately \n240,000\n net rentable square feet located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \n143\nTable of Contents\n     \nPending Disposition and Impairment\nAt March 31, 2024, the Company evaluated the expected hold period for a portion of its Shady Grove property,  consisting of 2 Choke Cherry Road, 2094 Gaither Road and a land parcel, located in Rockville, Maryland.  Based on a shorter-than-expected hold period, the Company reduced the carrying value of a portion of the property that the Company anticipates selling to a third-party developer to its estimated fair value at March 31, 2024.  As a result, each of BXP and BPLP recognized an impairment loss of approximately $\n13.6\n million during the year ended December 31, 2024.  The Company’s estimated fair value was based on Level 3 inputs as defined in ASC 820 and the terms of a pending offer from a third-party.  \nOn May 7, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with the third-party developer for the sale of 2 Choke Cherry Road, 2094 Gaither Road and the land parcel, located in Rockville, Maryland, for an aggregate gross sale price of approximately $\n24.8\n million.  On July 22, 2024, the Company executed an amendment to the agreement for an aggregate gross sale price of approximately $\n24.7\n million.  2 Choke Cherry Road and 2094 Gaither Road are \ntwo\n vacant office properties aggregating approximately \n143,000\n net rentable square feet that were taken out of service and held for redevelopment.  The disposition is subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions and there can be no assurance that this transaction will be consummated on the terms currently contemplated or at all.\n4. Leases\n \nThe Company estimates the collectability of its accrued rent and accounts receivable balances related to lease revenue.  When evaluating the collectability of these accrued rent and accounts receivable balances, management considers tenant creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in tenants’ payment patterns,\n on a lease-by-lease basis.  If the Company determines that the accrued rent and/or accounts receivable balances are no longer probable of collection then the balances are written-off and the lease is recognized on a cash basis.  \nIf applicable, information related to write-offs of accrued rent, net balances and accounts receivable, net\nbalances and reinstatements of accrued rent balances for the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures can be\nfound in Note 6.\nLessee\nThe following table provides lease cost information for the Company’s operating and finance leases for the years ended December 31, 2024, \n2023 and \n2022\n \n(in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\nLease costs\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating lease costs (1)\n$\n14,583\n \n$\n14,451\n \n$\n12,700\n \nFinance lease costs\nAmortization of right of use asset (2)\n$\n3,093\n \n$\n2,821\n \n$\n697\n \nInterest on lease liabilities (3)\n$\n13,374\n \n$\n13,747\n \n$\n3,236\n \n_______________\n(1)\nOne\n of the operating leases relates to an asset that was in predevelopment for the year ended December 31, 2024 and a portion of the year ended December 31, 2023.

For the year 2022, there were \nno\n operating leases related to assets under development. \n(2)\nThe finance leases relate to either land, buildings or assets that are/were in development.  For land leases classified as finance leases because of a purchase option that the Company views as an economic incentive, the Company follows its existing policy and does not depreciate land because it is assumed to have an indefinite life.  For all other finance leases, the Company would amortize the right of use asset over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.  If the finance lease relates to a property under development, the amortization of the right of use asset may be eligible for capitalization.  For assets under development, depreciation may commence once the asset is placed in-service and depreciation would be recognized in accordance with the Company’s policy. \n \n(3)\nOne\n of the finance leases relates to an asset under development for all or a portion of the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

The lease requires annual base rental payments of $\n250,000\n until the commencement of construction, as defined in the lease.  If the Company commences construction of a project on the site on or before August 1, 2028, then a final fixed rental payment is due in accordance with the lease at that time.  After August 1, 2028, if the Company commences construction of a project on the site, then a final rental payment based on the then current fair market value will be due at that time.  In addition, the lease requires annual payments of $\n500,000\n through 2033 to fund maintenance and improvements to the Station.  The Company has assumed that it will begin construction on the site on or before August 1, 2028.  The incremental borrowing rate for this lease is \n6.57\n% per annum.  The net present value of the ground lease payments is approximately $\n23.2\n million.  The Company classifies this lease as an operating lease.  As a result, the Company recorded a Right of Use Assets – Operating Leases and Lease Liabilities – Operating Leases of approximately $\n23.9\n million and $\n23.2\n million, respectively, on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2024.  The ground lease had operating lease costs of approximately $\n0.3\n million for the period from March 28, 2024 through December 31, 2024.  There can be no assurance that the Company will commence construction on the ground lease site on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.\nThe Company has a ground lease for the land underlying its residential property, The Skylyne, in Oakland, California.  The Skylyne is a residential property consisting of \n402\n residential units and supporting retail space totaling approximately \n331,000\n net rentable square feet.  The ground lease has approximately \n92\n years remaining (including extension options) and provides the Company with the right to purchase the land subject to certain conditions.  When the lease was executed in 2017, the purchase option was considered a bargain purchase option and, as a result, the Company classified it as a finance lease and the Company assumed the lessor would exercise its right to require the Company to purchase the land in May 2024 for approximately $\n38.7\n million.  In May 2024 and as of the date of this report, the lessor has not exercised this option and the Company reassessed the accounting for the ground lease and determined that the purchase option continues to be considered a bargain purchase option and the ground lease will continue to be accounted for as a finance lease.  The lease requires monthly base rental payments of a nominal amount until the purchase occurs, which the Company now estimates will be in 2030.  As a result of the reassessment, the lease liability was remeasured and reduced to approximately $\n0.1\n million.  In conjunction with the reduction in the lease liability, the right of use asset was reduced to $\n0\n and the difference between the lease liability and right of use asset, before the remeasurement, of approximately $\n9.5\n million was recorded as a decrease to interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.  There can be no assurance that the Company will ultimately exercise its ground lease purchase option on the schedule currently contemplated or at all.\n \n146\nTable of Contents\n     \nLessor\nOperating Leases\nThe following table summarizes the components of lease revenue recognized during the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, \n2023 and 2022 included within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations (in \nthousands):\nYear ended December 31,\nLease Revenue\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFixed contractual payments\n$\n2,605,272\n \n$\n2,503,106\n \n$\n2,426,007\n \nVariable lease payments\n570,541\n \n550,641\n \n492,361\n \nSales-type lease\n992\n \n926\n \n—\n \n$\n3,176,805\n \n$\n3,054,673\n \n$\n2,918,368\n \nThe future contractual lease payments to be received (excluding operating expense reimbursements and percentage rent) by the Company as of December 31, 2024, under non-cancelable operating leases which expire on various dates through 2049 (in thousands): \nYears Ending December 31,\n2025\n$\n2,497,727\n \n2026\n2,508,910\n \n2027\n2,510,236\n \n2028\n2,396,893\n \n2029\n2,251,345\n \nThereafter\n13,249,374\n \nNo\n single tenant represented more than \n10.0\n% of the Company’s total lease revenue for any of the years ended December 31, 2024, \n2023 and 2022\n.\nSales-type\n Lease\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, \n2023 and 2022, \nthe Company had \none non-cancelable ground lease obligation\n, as lessor, that is classified as a sales-type lease with an expiration date in 2119.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company conducted and reviewed, along with its joint venture partners, the 2025 business plans for each of its ventures.  During this year end review, the Company evaluated key indicators related to certain investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, including changes in cash flows, declining market conditions and leasing activities, continued actual and projected operating deficits and receipts and considerations of third-party joint venture property appraisals.  Such evaluation of key impairment indicators resulted in the Company determining that the decline in value, for certain joint venture properties, was other-than-temporary and therefore the Company recorded impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2024.  The Company determined that its investment was categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as it utilized significant unobservable inputs in its assessment.  \nThe table below states the amount of each impairment as well as the inputs used in the calculation (dollars in thousands).  \nProperty\nImpairment Amount\nExit Capitalization Rate\nDiscount Rate\nColorado Center\n$\n168,391\n \n7.5\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\nGateway Commons\n126,163\n \n7.0\n \n%\n9.0\n \n%\nSafeco Plaza\n46,784\n \n7.0\n \n%\n8.0\n \n%\nTotal\n$\n341,338\n \n Colorado Center consists of \nsix\n office buildings aggregating approximately \n1.1\n million net rentable square feet located in Santa Monica, California.

The repayment was completed with available cash.  The repayment price was approximately $\n713.3\n million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately $\n13.3\n million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repayment date.  Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid.  \nOn August 26, 2024, BPLP completed a public offering of $\n850.0\n million in aggregate principal amount of its \n5.750\n% unsecured senior notes due 2035.  The notes were priced at \n99.961\n% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately \n5.842\n% per annum to maturity.  The notes will mature on January 15, 2035, unless earlier redeemed.  The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $\n841.9\n million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses.\nThe indenture relating to the unsecured senior notes contains certain financial restrictions and requirements, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed \n60\n%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed \n50\n%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of greater than \n1.50\n, and (4) an unencumbered asset value of not less than \n150\n% of unsecured debt.\n \nAt December 31, 2024, BPLP was in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements.\nUnsecured Credit Facility\nBPLP’s unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2021 Credit Facility”) provides for borrowings of up to $\n2.0\n billion, as described below in this Note 7, through BPLP’s revolving facility, subject to customary conditions.  The 2021 Credit Facility matures on \nJune 15, 2026\n and includes a sustainability-linked pricing component.  Under the 2021 Credit Facility, BPLP had the option to increase the original total commitment of $\n1.5\n billion by up to an additional $\n500.0\n million by increasing the amount of the Revolving Facility and/or by incurring one or more term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions (the “Accordion Option”).  On \n155\nTable of Contents\n     \nSeptember 28, 2023, BPLP exercised a portion of the Accordion Option which increased the then maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 Credit Facility from $\n1.5\n billion to $\n1.815\n billion.  On April 29, 2024, BPLP exercised the remainder of the Accordion Option and further increased the maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 Credit Facility to $\n2.0\n billion.  All other terms of the 2021 Credit Facility remain unchanged.  \nAt BPLP’s option, loans under the 2021 Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) (a) in the case of loans denominated in Dollars, Term SOFR and SOFR, (b) in the case of loans denominated in Euro, EURIBOR, (c) in the case of loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, Term CORRA, and (d) in the case of loans denominated in Sterling, SONIA, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 70.0 to 140.0 basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%, (b) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (c) Term SOFR plus 1.00%, and (d) 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0 to 40 basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating.  In addition, there is a SOFR credit spread adjustment of \n0.10\n%.\nThe 2021 Credit Facility also features a sustainability-linked pricing component such that if BPLP meets certain sustainability performance targets, the applicable per annum interest rate will be reduced by \none\n basis point.  In addition, the 2021 Credit Facility contains a competitive bid option for up to \n65\n% of the Revolving Facility that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to BPLP\n \nat a reduced interest rate.\nPursuant to the 2021 Credit Facility, BPLP is obligated to pay (1) in quarterly installments a facility fee on the total commitment under the Revolving Facility at a rate per annum ranging from \n0.10\n% to \n0.30\n% based on BPLP’s credit rating and (2) an annual fee on the undrawn amount of each letter of credit ranging from \n0.70\n% to \n1.40\n% based on BPLP\n’s\n credit rating.\nBased on BPLP’s December 31, 2024 credit rating, (1) the applicable Daily SOFR, Term SOFR, alternative currency daily rate, and alternative currency term rate margins are \n0.850\n%, (2) the alternate base rate margin is \nzero\n basis points and (3) the facility fee is \n0.20\n% per annum.\nAt December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BPLP had \nno\n amount outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility.  The 2021 Credit Facility is used as a backstop for BPLP’s $\n500.0\n million unsecured commercial paper program (See “\nUnsecured Commercial Paper” \nbelow).  As such, BPLP intends to maintain, at a minimum, availability under the 2021 Credit Facility in an amount equal to the amount of unsecured commercial paper notes outstanding.  \nUnsecured Term Loans\nOn January 4, 2023, BPLP entered into a credit agreement that provided for a $\n1.2\n billion unsecured term loan facility (the “2023 Unsecured Term Loan”).  Upon entry into the credit agreement, BPLP exercised its option to draw $\n1.2\n billion under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan.  On April 29, 2024, BPLP repaid $\n500.0\n million of the outstanding balance under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan from the proceeds of its unsecured commercial paper program (See “\nUnsecured Commercial Paper\n” below).  \nUnder the credit agreement governing the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan, BPLP may, at any time prior to the maturity date, increase total commitments by up to an additional $\n300.0\n million in aggregate principal amount by increasing the existing 2023 Unsecured Term Loan or incurring \none\n or more additional term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions.  The 2023 Unsecured Term Loan had an initial maturity date of \nMay 16, 2024\n, with \none\n \n12\n-month extension option, subject to customary conditions.  On May 16, 2024, BPLP exercised its option to extend the maturity date of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan to \nMay 16, 2025\n.  All other terms of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan remain unchanged.    \nAt BPLP’s option, loans under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus \n0.5\n%, (b) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (c) Term SOFR for a one-month period plus \n1.00\n%, and (d) \n1.00\n%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from \n0\n to \n60\n basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating; or (2) a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR with a one-month period plus a margin ranging from \n75\n to \n160\n basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating.\n \nOn September 27, 2024, BPLP entered into a credit agreement that provides for a $\n100.0\n million unsecured term loan facility (the “2024 Unsecured Term Loan”) with a lender (the “Lender”) under the mortgage loan collateralized by the Company’s Santa Monica Business Park properties located in Santa Monica, California (the “SMBP Loan”).  Upon entry into the credit agreement, BPLP exercised its option to draw $\n100.0\n million under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan.  The proceeds were used to modify and repay the portion of the SMBP Loan held by \n156\nTable of Contents\n     \nthe Lender.  After the repayment, the SMBP Loan had a remaining principal balance of $\n200.0\n million.  The 2024 Unsecured Term Loan matures on September 26, 2025 with \nthree\n, \none\n-year extension options, subject to customary conditions.\nAt BPLP’s option, loans under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) \nzero\n, (b) Prime Rate, (c) the Federal Funds effective rate plus \n0.50\n%, and (d) Term SOFR for a one-month period plus \n1.10\n%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from \n0\n to \n60\n basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating; or (2) a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR with a one-month period plus, a margin ranging from \n75\n to \n160\n basis points based on BPLP’s credit rating.\n  The 2024 Unsecured Term Loan is subject to an interest rate swap contract to fix Daily Simple SOFR at an interest rate of approximately \n2.688\n% per annum through April 1, 2025 (See Note 8).\nBased on BPLP’s December 31, 2024 credit rating, (1) the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus \n1.05\n% per annum and (2) the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus \n1.05\n% per annum.  At December 31, 2024, BPLP had $\n100.0\n million and $\n700.0\n million of principal outstanding under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan and 2023 Unsecured Term Loan, respectively.  At December 31, 2023, BPLP had $\n1.2\n billion of principal outstanding under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan.\nThe 2023 and 2024 Unsecured Term Loans contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default provisions, including the failure to pay indebtedness, breaches of covenants and bankruptcy and other insolvency events, which could result in the acceleration of the obligation to repay any outstanding amount under the 2023 and 2024 Unsecured Term Loans.  \nAmong other covenants, the 2023 and 2024 Unsecured Term Loans require that BPLP maintain on an ongoing basis: (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed \n60\n%, however, the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than \n65\n% provided that it is reduced back to \n60\n% within one year, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed \n55\n%, (3) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least \n1.40\n to \n1.00\n, (4) an unsecured debt leverage ratio not to exceed \n60\n%, however, the unsecured debt leverage ratio may increase to no greater than \n65\n% provided that it is reduced to \n60\n% within one year, (5) an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least \n1.75\n to \n1.00\n and (6) limitations on permitted investments.\n \nAt December 31, 2024, BPLP was in compliance with each of these financial and other covenant requirements.\nUnsecured Commercial Paper\nOn April 17, 2024, BPLP established an unsecured commercial paper program.  Under the terms of the program, BPLP may issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of $\n500.0\n million with varying maturities of up to \none year\n.  Amounts available under the unsecured commercial paper program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time.  The notes are sold in private placements and rank pari passu with all of BPLP’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, including its outstanding senior notes.  The commercial paper program is backstopped by available capacity under the 2021 Credit Facility.  At December 31, 2024, BPLP had an aggregate of $\n500.0\n million of unsecured commercial paper notes outstanding that bore interest at a weighted-average rate of approximately \n4.79\n% per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of \n38\n days from the issuance date.\n \n8. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nBPLP’s agreements with derivative counterparties contain provisions whereby if BPLP defaults on the underlying indebtedness, including defaults where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then BPLP could also be declared in default of the swap derivative obligation.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company had not posted any collateral related to the agreements.\nEffective Hedge Instruments\nBPLP assesses the effectiveness of its derivatives both at inception and on an ongoing basis.  If the hedges are deemed to be effective, the fair value is recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently reclassified into “Interest expense” in the Company’s \nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n in the period that the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings.  BPLP’s derivative financial instruments are cash flow hedges that are designated as effective hedges, and they are carried at their estimated fair value on a recurring basis (See Note 2).  The Company did not incur ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.  \n157\nTable of Contents\n     \nBPLP’s and SMBP LLC’s derivative contracts consisted of the following at December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nDerivative Instrument\nAggregate Notional Amount \nStrike Rate Range\nBalance Sheet Location \nEffective Date \nMaturity Date\nLow \nHigh \nFair Value\nBPLP:\nInterest Rate Swaps\n$\n600,000\n \nDecember 15, 2023\nOctober 26, 2028\n3.790\n \n%\n—\n3.798\n \n%\nPrepaid expenses and other assets\n$\n4,042\n \nInterest Rate Swaps\n100,000\n \nSeptember 27, 2024\nApril 1, 2025\n2.688\n \n%\n—\n2.688\n \n%\nPrepaid expenses and other assets\n401\n \n700,000\n \n4,443\n \nSMBP LLC (1)\nInterest Rate Swaps\n200,000\n \nDecember 14, 2023\nApril 1, 2025\n2.661\n \n%\n—\n2.688\n \n%\nPrepaid expenses and other assets\n809\n \n$\n900,000\n \n$\n5,252\n \n_______________\n(1)\nA consolidated subsidiary of the Company that is the borrower under the mortgage loan collateralized by its Santa Monica Business Park property.\nThe following table presents the location in the financial statements of the gains or (losses) recognized as a result of the Company’s cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount of gain (loss) related to the effective portion recognized in other comprehensive income (1)\n$\n9,202\n \n$\n(\n14,405\n)\n$\n19,396\n \nAmount of gain (loss) related to the effective portion subsequently reclassified to earnings (2)\n$\n12,618\n \n$\n6,703\n \n$\n6,707\n \nAmount of gain (loss) related to the ineffective portion and amount excluded from effectiveness testing\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n_______________\n(1)\nIncludes the Company’s share of gain (loss) related to the effective portion of derivatives outstanding at its unconsolidated joint venture properties.\n(2)\nIncludes amounts from previous interest rate programs.\nBPLP has formally documented all of its relationships between hedge instruments and hedging items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivative's effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income (loss) and equity.  \nIneffective Hedging Instruments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, to satisfy a lender requirement, the Company entered into \ntwo\n agreements with the same third-party to purchase and sell a $\n600.0\n million interest rate cap.  The Company did not elect hedge accounting, and as such, any change in market value will be recognized in Gain (losses) from interest rate contracts in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized approximately $\n79,000\n of loss on its Consolidated Statement of Operations from entering into these agreements.  There was \nno\n ineffectiveness recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n9. Commitments and Contingencies \nGeneral\nIn the normal course of business, the Company guarantees its performance of services or indemnifies third parties against its negligence.  In addition, in the normal course of business, the Company guarantees to certain tenants the obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay tenant improvement allowances and brokerage commissions in connection with their leases and limited costs arising from delays in delivery of their premises.  \n158\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe Company had letter of credit and performance obligations related to lender and development requirements that total approximately $\n20.3\n million at December 31, 2024.\nCertain of the Company’s joint venture agreements include provisions whereby, at certain specified times, each partner has the right to initiate a purchase or sale of its interest in the joint venture.  From time to time, under certain of the Company’s joint venture agreements, if certain return thresholds are achieved, either the Company or its partners may be entitled to receive an additional promoted interest or payments. \nFrom time to time, the Company (or ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest) has agreed, and may in the future agree, to (1) guarantee portions of the principal, interest and other amounts in connection with their borrowings, (2) provide customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) in connection with their borrowings and (3) provide guarantees to lenders, tenants and other third parties for the completion of development projects.  The Company has agreements with its third-party joint venture partners whereby the partners agree to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee.  In some cases, the Company earns a fee from the applicable joint venture for providing the guarantee. \nIn connection with the refinancing of 767 Fifth Avenue’s (the General Motors Building) secured loan by the Company’s consolidated joint venture entity, 767 Venture, LLC, the Company guaranteed the consolidated entity’s obligation to fund various reserves for tenant improvement costs and allowances, leasing commissions and free rent obligations in lieu of cash deposits.  As of December 31, 2024, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $\n6.4\n million.  The Company earns a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and has an agreement with the outside partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee.  As of December 31, 2024, no amounts related to the guarantee were recorded as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn connection with the sale of Metropolitan Square, an approximately \n657,000\n square foot office building in Washington, DC in which the Company had a \n20\n% equity interest, the Company agreed to become a co-lender of up to $\n20.0\n million under a mezzanine loan.  The mezzanine loan has a maximum principal amount of $\n100.0\n million, and it is subordinate only to an existing senior loan.  The mezzanine loan may be drawn upon for future lease-up, operating and other costs on an as-needed basis, and amounts borrowed will bear interest at a per annum rate of \n12\n%, compounded monthly.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company has funded approximately $\n4.9\n million under the mezzanine loan.   \nLegal Matters \nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  These matters are generally covered by insurance.  Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company.\n \nIn connection with the acquisition of an office property in New York City in 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with the seller pursuant to which the seller could earn various fees (i.e., Fixed, Additional and Final Fees)  based on the future leasing performance of the property.  The Company initially accrued approximately $\n1.5\n million as an estimate of the fees it would owe the seller.  In 2020, the seller filed suit against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, claiming that consideration significantly in excess of the initial reserve amount is owed under the agreement.  The disagreement between the Company and the seller involves material issues of contract interpretation and, more importantly, the method of calculating fees, including various inputs (both facts and assumptions) that drive the calculations. \nOn January 25, 2024, the New York Supreme Court granted in part the seller’s motion for summary judgment finding that the Company owes the seller an “Additional Fee” and a “Final Fee” under the terms of the parties’ purchase agreement.  The court issued a follow-on order on February 8, 2024, confirming its earlier order that the seller is entitled to the fees described in the parties’ agreement.  Other than the “Fixed Fee,” which BXP agreed to pay and for which it had established a reserve of approximately $\n2.2\n million (including interest), the amount of the fees (if any) that are due to the seller has not been determined.  On December 9, 2024, the court issued a judgment awarding the seller the Fixed Fee (including interest) of approximately $\n2.7\n million and BXP paid this fee following the judgment.  For the Additional Fee and Final Fee, the seller submitted a request for the appointment of a Special Referee on January 7, 2025.  Separately, the Company filed a notice of appeal on January 15, 2025 to preserve the Company’s ability to appeal the grant of summary judgment on the question of whether the Company is liable for payment of the Additional Fee and Final Fee.  The Company has until July 15, 2025 (six months from the notice of appeal) to perfect the appeal.\n159\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe issue of an award of damages for the Additional Fee and the Final Fee remains outstanding with the court pending a determination by the Special Referee, which the court appointed on February 18, 2025.  The Company disputes the seller’s calculations and intends to continue defending itself vigorously.  However, there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in the lawsuit.  If the court ultimately agrees with the seller’s calculations, then amounts due to the seller could theoretically be as high as the additional $\n31\n million claimed in the seller’s complaint, plus interest.  Although the Company disputes those calculations, there can be no assurance that the Company’s ultimate liability will not be material.\nOn April 26, 2024, Brammer Bio MA, LLC (“Brammer”), a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and an abutter to the Company’s 290 Binney Street development project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, filed a complaint in Superior Court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts against the Company relating to certain ongoing construction activities.  \nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company commenced development of 290 Binney Street, an approximately \n573,000\n net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences property that is \n100\n% pre-leased to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals (“AstraZeneca”).  The Company has a \n55\n% interest in the joint venture that owns 290 Binney Street.  Brammer subleases the premises at 250 Binney Street, the Company’s approximately \n67,000\n net rentable square foot life sciences property that is adjacent to 290 Binney Street.\nBrammer alleged that, as a result of the Company’s construction of 290 Binney Street, it is threatened with irreparable harm due to intrusion onto the 250 Binney Street premises and the loss of its property rights.  Brammer also alleged that the 290 Binney Street development project has caused and is causing major disruption to its manufacturing operations, and that it has suffered and will continue to suffer damages in the form of losses to its clients and customers.  Brammer brought the action for quiet title, breach of contract, trespass and nuisance, and it is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and specific performance purportedly to protect its property interests in the premises located at 250 Binney Street.\nOn May 16, 2024, Brammer’s motion for a preliminary injunction was denied by the trial court.  Brammer subsequently appealed that decision, electing pursuant to Massachusetts civil procedure rules to petition for appeals to both a single justice of the Massachusetts Appeals Court and to a full appellate panel.  On July 16, 2024, the single justice assigned to the appeal issued an order declining to rule on the substance of the appeal petition.  Brammer still has the right to pursue the full panel hearing, although no date has been set for any such hearing.  \nThe Company believes it has meritorious defenses against Brammer’s claims and intends to defend against them vigorously.  However, there can be no assurance the Company will prevail in the litigation.  If the Company is enjoined from further construction activities, it could suffer delays in construction that could result in its failure to deliver a completed building on the schedule contemplated by the Company’s lease with AstraZeneca or at all, and this could result in owing financial penalties to AstraZeneca and other third parties.  Although the Company is unable to estimate a range of loss for all related matters for which losses are reasonably possible, if the court grants injunctive relief or awards monetary damages to Brammer, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is a named defendant in an alleged collective and class action wage and hour lawsuit filed on behalf of certain individuals who provided off-duty, uniformed security services at the Company’s buildings in New York City pursuant to the New York Police Department’s Paid Detail Program.  In addition to the Company, the plaintiffs also named as defendants more than eighty (\n80\n) other companies.  The plaintiffs filed the lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on January 24, 2025, and brought the claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the New York Labor Law and the Freelance Isn’t Free Act.  The plaintiffs subsequently amended the complaint on February 7, 2025 and requested leave to file a second amended complaint on February 12, 2025.  Each of the complaints alleges that the plaintiffs were not paid certain wages owed to them or were not paid in a timely manner and that the plaintiffs did not receive certain wage payment notices required by law.  The Company has not yet filed a responsive pleading and discovery has not yet commenced.  Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims and intends to defend against them vigorously, there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in the lawsuit.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\n \nManagement of the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of tenants and may require tenants to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees, security deposits and/or other financial guarantees.  Although the Company’s properties are geographically diverse and tenants operate in a variety of \n160\nTable of Contents\n     \nindustries, to the extent the Company has a significant concentration of rental revenue from any single tenant, the inability of that tenant to make its lease payments could have an adverse effect on the Company.\n \nInsurance\nThe Company’s property insurance program per occurrence limits are $\n1.0\n billion for its portfolio insurance program, including coverage for acts of terrorism other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorism (“Terrorism Coverage”).  The Company also carries $\n1.35\n billion of property insurance in excess of the $\n1.0\n billion of coverage in the Company’s property insurance program for 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, consisting of $\n750\n million of property and Terrorism Coverage in excess of the Company’s property insurance program and $\n600\n million of Terrorism Coverage only in excess of the $\n1.75\n billion of coverage.  Certain properties, including the General Motors Building located at 767 Fifth Avenue in New York, New York (“767 Fifth Avenue”), are currently insured in separate insurance programs.  The property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 Fifth Avenue are $\n1.625\n billion, including Terrorism Coverage.  The Company also currently carries nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, “TRIA”) (“NBCR Coverage”), which is provided by IXP, LLC (“IXP”) as a direct insurer, for the properties in the Company’s portfolio, including 767 Fifth Avenue, but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which the Company manages.  The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is $\n1.0\n billion.  Under TRIA, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the NBCR Coverage provided by IXP is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a “program trigger.”  The program trigger is $\n200\n million, the coinsurance is \n20\n% and the deductible is \n20\n% of the premiums earned by the insurer for the year prior to a claim.  If the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIA.  The Company may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if TRIA is not extended after its expiration on December 31, 2027, if there is a change in its portfolio or for any other reason.  The Company intends to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance.\nThe Company also currently carries earthquake insurance on its properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes.  Specifically, the Company currently carries earthquake insurance which covers its San Francisco and Los Angeles regions with a $\n330\n million per occurrence limit, and a $\n330\n million annual aggregate limit, $\n30\n million of which is provided by IXP, as a direct insurer.  This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of \n5\n% of the value of the affected property.  In addition, the Company currently carries earthquake insurance which covers its Seattle region with a $\n110\n million per occurrence limit, and a $\n110\n million annual aggregate limit.  This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of \n2\n% of the value of the affected property.  The amount of the Company’s earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes.  In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact the Company’s ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk.  The Company may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of its earthquake insurance program on some or all of its properties in the future if the premiums exceed the Company’s estimation of the value of the coverage.\nIXP, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of the Company’s earthquake insurance coverage for its Greater San Francisco and Los Angeles properties and the Company’s NBCR Coverage.  Insofar as the Company owns IXP, it is responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by the Company’s NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government.  IXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out and its insurance policy is maintained after the payout by the Federal Government.  If the Company experiences a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy, the Company would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment.  Therefore, insurance coverage provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance.  In addition, BPLP has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of IXP in the amount of $\n20.0\n million.\nThe Company continues to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics and cybersecurity incidents, in particular, but the Company cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years.  There are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which the Company cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost.  With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics or other \n161\nTable of Contents\n     \ncatastrophic events, if the Company experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, the Company could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties.  Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that the Company could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property.  Any such loss could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nState and Local Tax Matters\n \nBecause BXP is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but is subject to certain state and local taxes.  In the normal course of business, certain entities through which the Company owns real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits.  Although the Company believes that it has substantial arguments in favor of its positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue.  Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material.  However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.\n \nEnvironmental Matters\n \nIt is the Company’s policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with the Company’s acquisition of properties.  These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the Company is not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to its properties that the Company believes would have such a material adverse effect.  However, from time to time environmental conditions at the Company’s properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.\nIn February 1999, the Company (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination.  The Company developed an office park on the property.  The Company engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction.  Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to the Company’s ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify the Company for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions.  Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses and contractual limitations, including time limits, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.\nEnvironmental investigations at some of the Company’s properties and certain properties owned by affiliates of the Company have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties.  In each case the Company engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities.  In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site.  The Company also believes that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases.  Although the Company believes that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, the Company will take such further response actions (if any) that it deems necessary or advisable.  Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. \nSome of the Company’s properties and certain properties owned by the Company’s affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination.  Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner.  In these situations, it is the Company’s practice to investigate the nature and \n162\nTable of Contents\n     \nextent of detected contamination, including potential issues associated with vapor intrusion concerns and/or potential contaminant migration to or from the subject property in ground water, assess potential liability risks and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures.  The Company then uses this information as part of its decision-making process with respect to the acquisition, deal structure and/or development of the property.  For example, the Company owns a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility.  Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants.  The Company has developed an office park on this property.  Prior to and during redevelopment activities, the Company engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization.  A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site.  The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws.\nThe Company expects that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on its business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  However, the Company cannot assure you that it has identified all environmental liabilities at its properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at the Company’s properties or that the Company will be indemnified, in full or at all or that the Company will have insurance coverage, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.\n10. Noncontrolling Interests \nNoncontrolling interests relate to the interests in BPLP not owned by BXP and interests in consolidated property partnerships not wholly-owned by the Company.  As of December 31, 2024, the noncontrolling interests in BPLP consisted of the following:\nOP Units\nLTIP Units (1)\n2022 MYLTIP Units\n2023 MYLTIP Units\n2024 MYLTIP Units\n15,730,882\n2,335,229\n252,151\n322,053\n330,479\n__________\n(1)\nIncludes \n617,961\n LTIP Units earned by employees under the Company’s multi-year long-term incentive awards granted between 2012 and 2021 (i.e., 2012 OPP and 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP awards).\nNoncontrolling Interest—Common Units\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, \n1,147,013\n and \n102,699\n OP Units, respectively, were presented by the holders for redemption (including an aggregate of \n122,241\n and \n94,863\n OP Units, respectively, issued upon conversion of LTIP Units, 2012 OPP Units and MYLTIP Units) and were redeemed by BXP in exchange for an equal number of shares of Common Stock.\nAt December 31, 2024, BPLP had outstanding the 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units.  Prior to the end of the respective \nthree\n-year performance period for each plan, holders of MYLTIP Units are entitled to receive per unit distributions equal to one-tenth (\n10\n%) of the regular quarterly distributions payable on an OP Unit, but will not be entitled to receive any special distributions.  After the three-year performance period for each plan has ended, (1) the number of MYLTIP Units, both vested and unvested, that MYLTIP award recipients have earned, if any, based on the establishment of a performance pool, will be entitled to receive distributions in an amount per unit equal to distributions, both regular and special, payable on an OP Unit and (2) with respect to the 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units, the Company will make a “catch-up” cash payment on the MYLTIP Units that are ultimately earned in an amount equal to the regular and special dividends, if any, declared during the performance period on a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units that are earned, less the distributions actually paid during the performance period on all of the awarded 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units. \nOn February 4, 2022, the \nthree\n-year measurement period for the Company’s 2019 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP’s relative TSR performance, the final payout was determined to be \n69.0\n% of target, or an aggregate of approximately $\n8.6\n million (after giving effect to employee separations).  As a result, an aggregate of \n144,043\n 2019 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited. \nOn February 3, 2023, the \nthree\n-year measurement period for the Company’s 2020 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP’s relative TSR performance, the final payout was determined to be \n50\n% of target, or an aggregate of approximately $\n3.8\n million (after giving effect to employee separations).  As a result, an aggregate of \n152,460\n 2020 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited.\n163\nTable of Contents\n     \nOn February 1, 2024, the \nthree\n-year measurement period for the Company’s 2021 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP’s absolute and relative TSR performance, the final payout was determined to be \n112\n% of target, or an aggregate of approximately $\n12.6\n million (after giving effect to employee separations).  As a result, an aggregate of \n155,625\n 2021 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited.\nThe following table presents BPLP’s distributions on the OP Units and LTIP Units and MYLTIP Units paid or declared during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nRecord Date\nPayment Date\nDistributions per OP Unit and LTIP Unit\nDistributions per MYLTIP Unit\nDecember 31, 2024\nJanuary 30, 2025\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nSeptember 30, 2024\nOctober 31, 2024\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nJune 28, 2024\nJuly 31, 2024\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nMarch 28, 2024\nApril 30, 2024\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nDecember 29, 2023\nJanuary 30, 2024\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nSeptember 29, 2023\nOctober 31, 2023\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nJune 30, 2023\nJuly 31, 2023\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nMarch 31, 2023\nApril 28, 2023\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nDecember 30, 2022\nJanuary 30, 2023\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nSeptember 30, 2022\nOctober 31, 2022\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nJune 30, 2022\nJuly 29, 2022\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nMarch 31, 2022\nApril 29, 2022\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nDecember 31, 2021\nJanuary 28, 2022\n$\n0.98\n \n$\n0.098\n \nA holder of an OP Unit may present the OP Unit to BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally \none\n year from issuance).  Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, BPLP must redeem the OP Unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of Common Stock of BXP.  BXP may, in its sole discretion, elect to assume and satisfy the redemption obligation by paying either cash or issuing \none\n share of Common Stock.  The value of the OP Units (other than OP Units owned by BXP), and LTIP Units (including the 2012 OPP Units and 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units), assuming in each case that all conditions had been met for the conversion thereof, had all of such units been redeemed at December 31, 2024 was approximately $\n1.4\n billion based on the last reported price of a share of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $\n74.36\n per share on December 31, 2024. \nNoncontrolling Interests—Property Partnerships\nThe noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity interests in ventures that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company because the Company exercises control over the entities that own the properties.  The equity interests in these ventures that are not owned by the Company, totaling approximately $\n1.9\n billion and $\n1.6\n billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included in Noncontrolling Interests—Property Partnerships on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company completed the sale of a \n45\n% interest in 290 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The Company retains a \n55\n% ownership interest in the joint venture.  The institutional investor funded approximately $\n97.2\n million in cash at closing, which is less than \n45\n% of the agreed upon carrying value of the property immediately prior to the transaction.  The institutional investor will fund all construction costs until its equity balance is proportionate to its ownership percentage, after which the Company and the institutional investor will fund the development project based on their respective ownership interests.  The transaction did not qualify as a sale of real estate for financial reporting purposes as the Company continues to effectively control the property and thus will continue to account for the property on a consolidated basis in its financial statements and no gain was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company provides customary development, property management and leasing services to the joint venture. \nThe Company has accounted for the transaction as an equity transaction and as of March 21, 2024 has recognized noncontrolling interest in its Consolidated Balance Sheets totaling approximately $\n104.6\n million, which is \n164\nTable of Contents\n     \nequal to \n45\n% of the aggregate carrying value of the total equity of the property immediately prior to the transaction.  The difference between the cash proceeds received and the noncontrolling interest recognized, which was approximately $\n7.5\n million, has been reflected as a decrease in additional paid-in capital in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At the end of each reporting period, there will be a reallocation of the partners’ equity balances such that the ending balance in each partners’ capital account reflects each partners’ claim on net assets. These adjustments will impact additional paid-in capital and noncontrolling interest in property partnerships in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of December 31, 2024, the institutional investor has funded construction costs so that its equity balance is proportionate to its ownership percentage and the Company no longer needs to make adjustments impacting additional paid-in capital and noncontrolling interest in property partnerships in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n 290 Binney Street is an approximately \n573,000\n net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences development project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The  development project is \n100\n% pre-leased to a life sciences company.\n   \n11. Stockholders’ Equity / Partners’ Capital \nAs of December 31, 2024, BXP had \n158,174,995\n shares of Common Stock outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2024, BXP owned \n1,762,411\n general partnership units and \n156,412,584\n limited partnership units in BPLP.\nOn May 17, 2023, BXP renewed its “at the market” (“ATM”) stock offering program through which it may sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $\n600.0\n million of its Common Stock through sales agents over a \nthree\n-year period.  Under the ATM stock offering program, BXP may also engage in forward sale transactions with affiliates of certain sales agents for the sale of its Common Stock on a forward basis.  This program replaced BXP’s prior $\n600.0\n million ATM stock offering program that was scheduled to expire on May 22, 2023.

Segment Information \nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses and about which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Makers (“CODM”).  The CODM decides how resources should be allocated and assesses performance on a recurring basis, at least quarterly.  The Company’s CODMs are its Chief Executive Officer and President.  The CODMs review operating performance and financial reports by geographic area and property type.  In addition, given the size of the Company’s joint venture portfolio, the CODMs utilize the Company’s share of net operating income (“NOI”), which includes the Company’s share of NOI from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures, as its profit or loss measure in assessing each segment’s performance and deciding how to allocate resources.  \nThe Company’s share of NOI is used by the CODMs to evaluate the profitability and performance of each geographic area on a consistent and comparable basis, supporting decisions on capital resource allocation, including in connection with development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activities in each segment.  Additionally, the Company believes its share of NOI is useful as a profit or loss measure and believes it provides useful information regarding its results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership.\nAsset information by segment is not reported because the Company and the CODMs are not provided with the segment asset information and therefore do not use this measure to assess performance or allocate resources.    Asset values for the Company’s properties are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at historical cost, which may not reflect current market values.  Therefore, depreciation and amortization expense is not allocated among segments. The following are not included in the Company’s share of NOI as they are not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level: development and management services revenue, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts, gains on sales of real estate, gain on sales-type lease, interest and other income (loss), other income - assignment fee, gains (losses) from investments in securities, unrealized gain (loss) on non-real estate investments, corporate general and administrative expense, payroll and related costs from management services contracts, transaction costs, depreciation and amortization expense, losses from interest rate contracts, impairment loss and interest expense. The Company’s share of NOI presented may not be comparable to what is reported by other REITs or real estate companies that define NOI differently.  \nThe Company’s segments by geographic area are Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC.  The Company also presents information for each segment by property type, including Office (which includes office, life sciences and retail), Residential and Hotel.  The Company shows the different property types as the revenue from each type is derived from non-comparable lease structures.   \n166\nTable of Contents\n     \nThe following tables present

Earnings Per Share / Common Unit \nBXP\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of both the net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and the number of common shares used in the computation of basic earnings per share (“EPS”), which is calculated by dividing net income attributable to BXP, Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are also participating securities.  As such, unvested restricted common stock of BXP and BPLP’s LTIP Units, 2012 OPP Units and MYLTIP Units are considered participating securities.  Participating securities are included in the computation of basic EPS of BXP using the two-class method.  Participating securities are included in the computation of diluted EPS of BXP using the if-converted method if the impact is dilutive.  Because the 2012 OPP Units and 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units required, and the 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units require, BXP to outperform certain performance thresholds, unless such thresholds have been met by the end of the applicable reporting period, BXP excludes such units from the diluted EPS calculation.  Other potentially dilutive common shares, including stock options, restricted stock and other securities of BPLP that are exchangeable for BXP’s Common Stock, and the related impact on earnings, are considered when calculating diluted EPS.\n171\nTable of Contents\n     \n \nYear ended December 31, 2024\n \nIncome\n(Numerator)\nShares\n(Denominator)\nPer Share\nAmount\n \n(in thousands, except for per share amounts)\nBasic Earnings:\nNet income attributable to BXP, Inc. \n$\n14,272\n \n157,468\n \n$\n0.09\n \nEffect of Dilutive Securities:\nStock Based Compensation\n—\n \n325\n \n—\n \nDiluted Earnings:\nNet income attributable to BXP, Inc. \n$\n14,272\n \n157,793\n \n$\n0.09\n \n \nYear ended December 31, 2023\n \nIncome\n(Numerator)\nShares\n(Denominator)\nPer Share\nAmount\n \n(in thousands, except for per share amounts)\nBasic Earnings:\nNet income attributable to BXP, Inc. \n$\n190,215\n \n156,863\n \n$\n1.21\n \nEffect of Dilutive Securities:\nStock Based Compensation\n—\n \n338\n \n—\n \nDiluted Earnings:\nNet income attributable to BXP, Inc. \n$\n190,215\n \n157,201\n \n$\n1.21\n \n \nYear ended December 31, 2022\n \nIncome\n(Numerator)\nShares\n(Denominator)\nPer Share\nAmount\n \n(in thousands, except for per share amounts)\nBasic Earnings:\nNet income attributable to BXP, Inc. \n$\n848,947\n \n156,726\n \n$\n5.42\n \nAllocation of undistributed earnings to participating securities\n(\n891\n)\n—\n \n(\n0.01\n)\nNet income attributable to BXP, Inc. \n848,056\n \n156,726\n \n5.41\n \nEffect of Dilutive Securities:\nStock Based Compensation\n—\n \n411\n \n(\n0.01\n)\nDiluted Earnings:\nNet income attributable to BXP, Inc. \n$\n848,056\n \n157,137\n \n$\n5.40\n \nBPLP\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of both the net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership and the number of common units used in the computation of basic earnings per common unit, which is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership by the weighted-average number of common units outstanding during the period.

Employee Benefit Plans \nEffective January 1, 1985, the predecessor of the Company adopted a 401(k) Savings Plan (the “Plan”) for its employees.  Upon formation, the Company adopted the Plan and the terms of the Plan.\n \nUnder the Plan, as amended, the Company’s matching contribution equals \n200\n% of the first \n3\n% of participant’s eligible earnings contributed (utilizing earnings that are not in excess of an amount established by the IRS ($\n345,000\n, $\n330,000\n and $\n305,000\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively), indexed for inflation) with no vesting requirement.  The Company’s aggregate matching contribution for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $\n5.9\n million, $\n5.4\n million and $\n4.8\n million, respectively.\n \nThe Company also maintains a deferred compensation plan that is designed to allow officers of BXP to defer a portion of the officer’s current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer.  The Company’s obligation under the plan is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the plan participants in the future.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had maintained approximately $\n38.7\n million and $\n35.3\n million, respectively, in a separate account, which is not restricted as to its use.  The Company’s liability under the plan is equal to the total amount of compensation deferred by the plan participants and earnings on the deferred compensation pursuant to investments elected by the plan participants.  The Company’s liability as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $\n38.7\n million and $\n35.3\n million, respectively, which are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n15. Stock Option and Incentive Plan \nAt the Company’s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders held on May 20, 2021, its stockholders approved the Boston Properties, Inc. 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”).  The 2021 Plan replaced the Boston Properties, Inc. 2012 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”) and no further awards will be issued under the 2012 Plan.  The material features of the 2021 Plan include, among other things: (i) the maximum number of shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance under the 2021 Plan is \n5,400,000\n shares less one share for every one share that was granted between March 4, 2021 and May 19, 2021 under the 2012 Plan, (ii) shares of common stock underlying awards granted under the 2021 Plan or the 2012 Plan that are forfeited, canceled or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) will be added back to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2021 Plan and, with respect to “full-value” awards under the 2021 Plan or the 2012 Plan, shares tendered or held back for taxes and shares previously reserved for issuance pursuant to such an award to the extent that such shares are not issued and are no longer issuable pursuant to such an award (e.g., in the event that a full-value award that may be settled in cash or by issuance of shares of common stock is settled in cash) will be added back to the shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan, (iii) the award of stock options (both incentive and non-qualified options), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, restricted stock, unrestricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, cash-based awards and other equity-based awards (including LTIP Units) is permitted, (iv) stock options may not be repriced and “underwater” stock options may not be exchanged for another award or cash without stockholder approval; and (v) the term of the 2021 Plan ends \nten\n years from the date of stockholder approval, or May 20, 2031.\nOn January 25, 2024, the Compensation Committee of BXP’s Board of Directors approved the grant of 2024 Multi-Year Long-Term Incentive Program (the “2024 MYLTIP”) awards under the 2021 Plan to certain executive officers of BXP.  \nThe 2024 MYLTIP awards consists of three components.  Two of the components, each weighted 40%, utilize BXP’s TSR over a three-year measurement period as the performance metrics and the third component utilizes a leverage ratio as the performance metric.\n  Earned awards will range from \nzero\n to a maximum of \n330,479\n LTIP Units depending on BXP’s performance under the three components, with a target of approximately \n165,240\n LTIP Units.  Under ASC 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” the 2024 MYLTIP awards have an aggregate value of approximately $\n11.1\n million. \nOn February 1, 2024, the \nthree\n-year measurement period for the Company’s 2021 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP’s absolute and relative TSR performance, the final payout was determined to be \n112\n% of target, or an aggregate of approximately $\n12.6\n million (after giving effect to employee separations).  As a result, an aggregate of \n155,625\n 2021 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited.\nOn February 3, 2023, the \nthree\n-year measurement period for the Company’s 2020 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP’s relative TSR performance, the final payout was determined to be \n50\n% of target, or an aggregate of approximately $\n3.8\n million (after giving effect to employee separations).  As a result, an aggregate of \n152,460\n 2020 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited.\n174\nTable of Contents\n     \nOn February 4, 2022, the \nthree\n-year measurement period for the Company’s 2019 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP’s relative TSR performance, the final payout was determined to be \n69.0\n% of target, or an aggregate of approximately $\n8.6\n million (after giving effect to employee separations).  As a result, an aggregate of \n144,043\n 2019 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited. \nBXP issued \n83,316\n, \n73,762\n and \n41,818\n shares of restricted common stock and BPLP issued \n451,044\n, \n430,824\n and \n280,616\n LTIP Units to employees and non-employee directors under the 2012 Plan and the 2021 Plan during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  BXP did not issue any non-qualified stock options under the 2012 Plan or 2021 Plan during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.  BPLP issued \n330,479\n 2024 MYLTIP Units, \n322,053\n 2023 MYLTIP Units and \n254,061\n 2022 MYLTIP Units to employees under the 2021 Plan during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Employees and non-employee directors paid $\n0.01\n per share of restricted common stock and $\n0.25\n per LTIP Unit and MYLTIP Unit.  When issued, LTIP Units are not economically equivalent in value to a share of Common Stock, but over time can increase in value to one-for-one parity with Common Stock if there is sufficient appreciation in the value of the Company’s assets.  The aggregate value of the LTIP Units is included in noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of BXP and BPLP.  A majority of the grants of restricted common stock and LTIP Units to employees vest in \nfour\n equal annual installments.  Restricted common stock is measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of BXP’s Common Stock on the date of grant as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange.  Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period.  Because the 2012 OPP Units and 2013 - 2024 MYLTIP Units are subject to both a service condition and a market condition, the Company recognizes the related compensation expense under the graded vesting attribution method.  Under the graded vesting attribution method, each portion of the award that vests at a different date is accounted for as a separate award and recognized over the period appropriate to that portion so that the compensation cost for each portion should be recognized in full by the time that portion vests.  The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur on its awards of stock-based compensation.  Dividends paid on both vested and unvested shares of restricted stock are charged directly to Dividends in Excess of Earnings in BXP’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Partners’ Capital in BPLP’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Aggregate stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock, LTIP Units and MYLTIP Units was approximately $\n42.6\n million, $\n50.2\n million and $\n50.7\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  At December 31, 2024, there was (1) an aggregate of approximately $\n21.6\n million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock and LTIP Units and (2) \nno\n unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units.  The unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock and LTIP Units is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately \n2.4\n years.\nThe shares of restricted stock were valued at approximately $\n5.3\n million ($\n63.28\n per share weighted-average), $\n5.4\n million ($\n72.57\n per share weighted-average) and $\n4.7\n million ($\n111.47\n per share weighted-average) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \nLTIP Units were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation method model in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718.  LTIP Units issued during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were valued at approximately $\n26.8\n million, $\n29.9\n million and $\n28.9\n million, respectively.  The weighted-average per unit fair value of LTIP Unit grants in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n59.41\n, $\n69.29\n and $\n103.06\n, respectively.  The per unit fair value of each LTIP Unit granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions; an expected life of \n5.7\n years, \n5.7\n years and \n5.7\n years, a risk-free interest rate of \n4.03\n%, \n3.67\n% and \n1.71\n% and an expected price volatility of \n36.0\n%, \n32.0\n% and \n31.0\n%, respectively.\n \nThere were \nno\n non-qualified stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \n175\nTable of Contents\n     \nA summary of the status of BXP’s stock options as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and changes during the years then ended are presented below:\nShares\nWeighted-Average\nExercise Price\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021\n103,641\n \n$\n97.01\n \nExercised\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2022\n103,641\n \n$\n97.01\n \nForfeited\n(\n103,641\n)\n$\n—\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nExercised\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nThere were \nno\n stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  In addition, BXP had \n103,641\n options exercisable and vested at a weighted-average exercise price of $\n97.01\n at December 31, 2022.\nBXP adopted the 1999 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”) to encourage the ownership of Common Stock by eligible employees.  The Stock Purchase Plan became effective on January 1, 1999 with an aggregate maximum of \n250,000\n shares of Common Stock available for issuance.  The Stock Purchase Plan provides for eligible employees to purchase on the business day immediately following the end of the biannual purchase periods (i.e., January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31) shares of Common Stock at a purchase price equal to \n85\n% of the average closing prices of the Common Stock during the last \nten\n business days of the purchase period.  BXP issued \n17,237\n, \n18,552\n and \n9,813\n shares with the weighted-average purchase price equal to $\n56.28\n per share, $\n51.93\n per share and $\n87.30\n per share under the Stock Purchase Plan during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n16. Related Party Transactions \n \nRaymond A. Ritchey’s brother was employed by a real estate brokerage firm and participated in brokerage activities for which the Company paid the firm approximately $\n0.5\n million and $\n1.6\n million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The Company’s contract with this real estate brokerage firm ended on February 1, 2023 and as a result, it will not pay any further leasing commission to Mr. Ritchey’s brother.  Mr. Ritchey is a Senior Executive Vice President of BXP. \nOn June 5, 2023, a joint venture in which the Company owns a \n30\n% interest repaid the construction loan collateralized by its 500 North Capitol Street, NW property and obtained new mortgage loans with related parties.  The new mortgage loans have an aggregate principal balance of $\n105.0\n million, bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of \n6.83\n% per annum and mature on June 5, 2026.  The Company funded $\n10.5\n million of the refinancing at a fixed rate equal to \n8.03\n% per annum.  The loan has been reflected as a Related Party Note Receivable, Net on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company has recognized interest income of approximately $\n0.8\n million and $\n0.6\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  500 North Capitol Street, NW is an approximately \n231,000\n net rentable square foot office property in Washington, DC.\nOn July 13, 2018, the Company entered into a joint venture with a third party to acquire a development site at 3 Hudson Boulevard that, upon the future acquisition of additional available development rights, can accommodate an office tower with up to \n2.0\n million net rentable square feet located on the entire square block between 11th Avenue and Hudson Boulevard Park from West 34th Street to West 35th Street in New York City.  The Company owns a \n25\n% interest in, and is the managing member of the joint venture.  The Company provided $\n80.0\n million of mortgage financing to the joint venture that bears interest at a variable rate equal to Term SOFR plus approximately \n3.61\n% per annum and matured on \nAugust 7, 2024\n and is currently in maturity default.  The joint venture is negotiating a new third-party loan, however, there can be no assurance that the joint venture will enter into a new third-party loan on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all.  The Company is the lender of the loan, and the loan and accrued interest are reflected as Related Party Note Receivables, Net and Tenant and Other Receivables, Net, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company has recognized interest income of approximately $\n11.6\n million, $\n8.9\n million and $\n5.6\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The Company's policy is to record notes receivable at their unamortized cost, net of any unamortized deferred fees or costs, premiums or discounts and an allowance for credit losses.  Loan fees \n176\nTable of Contents\n     \nand direct costs associated with loans originated by the Company are deferred and amortized over the term of the note as interest income.\nIn accordance with the 2021 Plan, and as approved by its Board of Directors, \neight\n non-employee directors made elections to receive deferred stock units in lieu of cash fees for 2024.  As a result of these elections, the aggregate cash fees otherwise payable to a non-employee director during a fiscal quarter are converted into a number of deferred stock units equal to the aggregate cash fees divided by the last reported sales price of a share of BXP’s Common Stock on the last trading of the applicable fiscal quarter.  The deferred stock units are also credited with dividend equivalents as dividends are paid by BXP.  The deferred stock units may be settled in shares of BXP’s Common Stock upon the cessation of such director’s service on the Board of Directors of BXP.  The non-employee director compensation program provides, subject to certain conditions, the non-employee directors holding deferred stock units with the ability to elect, following cessation of their service on BXP’s Board of Directors, to diversify their investment elections into non-employer securities on a pre-tax basis and receive tax-deferred returns on such deferrals, which will ultimately be settled in cash.  The Company’s obligation under the plan is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the non-employee director in the future.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had maintained approximately $\n0.7\n million and $\n0.8\n million, respectively, in a separate account, which is not restricted as to its use.  The Company’s liability under the plan is equal to the total amount of compensation deferred by the non-employee director and earnings on the deferred compensation pursuant to investments elected by the non-employee director.  The Company’s liability as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $\n0.7\n million and $\n0.8\n million, respectively, which is included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The terms of the non-employee director compensation program require the classification of these deferred stock units as temporary equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of BXP, Inc. and Boston Properties Limited Partnership within Redeemable Deferred Stock Units.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, BXP had outstanding \n128,227\n and \n119,471\n deferred stock units, respectively.\n17. Subsequent Events \nOn January 2, 2025, a joint venture in which the Company has a \n50\n% ownership interest fully placed in-service 651 Gateway, an approximately \n327,000\n net rentable square feet laboratory/life sciences project located in South San Francisco, California.\nOn January 15, 2025, BPLP repaid $\n850.0\n million in aggregate principal amount of its \n3.200\n% senior notes due January 15, 2025.  The repayment was completed with available cash and the proceeds from BPLP’s August 2024 offering of unsecured senior notes (See Note 7).  The repayment price was approximately $\n863.6\n million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately $\n13.6\n million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repayment date.  Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid.  \nOn January 22, 2025, BXP’s Compensation Committee approved the 2025 Multi-Year Long-Term Incentive Program (the “2025 MYLTIP”) awards under the 2021 Plan to certain executive officers of BXP.  \nThe 2025 MYLTIP awards consists of three components.
