Founded in 1969, we invest in diversified commercial real estate and as of December 31, 2024, have a portfolio of over 15,600 properties in all 50 states of the United States (\"U.S.\"), the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), and six other countries in Europe. We are known as “The Monthly Dividend Company\n®\n” and have a mission to invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. Since our founding, we have declared 656 consecutive monthly dividends and are a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats\n®\n index for having increased our dividend for the last 30 consecutive years. \nOver the past 56 years, Realty Income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients. We are structured as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") requiring us annually to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains) in the form of dividends to our stockholders. \nOn January 23, 2024, we closed on our merger with Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. (\"Spirit\", formerly NYSE: SRC), which is further described in note\n \n2\n, Merger with Spirit Realty Capital, Inc.\n,\n to the consolidated financial statements. The Spirit portfolio consisted of 2,018 U.S. retail, industrial, and other properties across 49 states. This transaction enhanced the diversification and depth our real estate portfolio and allowed us to strengthen our longstanding relationships with existing clients and curate new ones. \nBUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY\nWe believe that actively managing a diversified portfolio of commercial properties under long-term, net lease agreements produces consistent and predictable income. A net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) fixed increases, (2) increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients’ gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of properties under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.\nDiversification is a key component of our investment philosophy. We believe that diversification of the portfolio by client, industry, geography, and property type leads to more consistent and predictable income for our stockholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration. Our investment activities have led to a diversified property portfolio and as of December 31, 2024, we owned or held interests in 15,621 properties located in all 50 U.S. states, the U.K., France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain\n \nwith clients doing business in 89 industries. \nAs we look to continue to expand our platform globally, we focus upon building relationships with new multinational clients that seek a real estate partner with an expanding geographic footprint.\nInvestment Strategy\nWe seek to acquire, invest in and develop high-quality real estate that our clients consider important to the successful operation of their businesses. We generally seek to own or hold interests in commercial real estate that has some or all of the following characteristics:\n•\nProperties in markets or locations important to our clients;\n•\nProperties with strong demographic attributes or that we deem to be profitable for our clients; \n•\nProperties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs;\n•\nProperties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents for similar properties; \n•\nProperties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long-term net lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases;\n2\nTable of \nContents\n•\nProperties that leverage relationships with clients, sellers, investors, or developers as part of a long-term strategy; and\n•\nProperties that leverage our proprietary insights, including those in locations and geographic markets we expect to remain strong or strengthen in the future.\nWe typically seek to invest in properties or portfolios of properties owned or leased by clients that are already or could become leaders in their respective businesses supported by mechanisms including (but not limited to) occupancy of prime real estate locations, pricing, merchandise assortment, service, quality, economies of scale, consumer branding, e-commerce, and advertising. We have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities, often using our relationships with various clients, owners/developers, brokers, and advisers to uncover and secure transactions. We also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations, clients, and industries for investment. This research expertise is instrumental to uncovering investment opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value.\nIn selecting potential investments, we generally look for clients with the following attributes:\n•\nReliable and sustainable cash flow, including demonstrated economic resiliency;\n•\nRevenue and cash flow from multiple sources;\n•\nAre willing to sign a long-term lease (10 or more years); and\n•\nAre large owners and users of real estate.\nFrom a retail perspective, our investment strategy is to target clients that have a service, non-discretionary, and/or low-price-point component to their business. We target investments with clients who have demonstrated resiliency to e-commerce or have a strong omnichannel retail strategy, uniting brick-and-mortar and mobile browsing, both of which reflect the continued importance of last mile retail, the movement of goods to their final destination, real estate as part of a customer experience and supply chain strategy. Our overall investments (including last mile retail) are driven by an optimal portfolio strategy that, among other considerations, targets allocation ranges by asset class and industry. We review our strategy periodically and stress test our portfolio in a variety of positive and negative economic scenarios to ensure we deliver consistent earnings growth and value creation across economic cycles. As a result of the execution of this strategy, approximately 91% of our annualized retail contractual rent on\n \nDecember 31, 2024, is derived from our clients with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics enhance the stability of the rental revenue generated from these properties.\nAfter applying this investment strategy, we pursue those transactions where we believe we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable risk-adjusted returns. We will continue to evaluate all investments for consistency with our objective of owning net lease assets.\nUnderwriting Strategy\nTo be considered for acquisition, investments must meet stringent underwriting requirements. We analyze investments based on one or more of the following criteria:\n•\nIndustry, client (including credit), and market conditions;\n•\nExpected financial returns under various scenarios (including default);\n•\nThe value of real estate (based on replacement cost, comparative rental rates and alternative uses), or other collateral backing the client’s contractual obligations; and\n•\nStore profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available or the importance of the real estate location to the operations of the clients’ business. \nWith regard to real estate investments, we typically own the land and building in which a client conducts its business or which are critical to the client’s ability to generate revenue. It has been our experience that clients must retain their profitable and critical locations to survive. Therefore, in the event of reorganization, we believe they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property.\nThus, as the property owner, we believe that we should fare better than unsecured creditors of the same client in the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by our client during reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new client or sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of our clients’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that meet our criteria for disposition.\n3\nTable of \nContents\nWe conduct comprehensive reviews of the business segments and industries in which our clients operate. In addition, prior to entering into any transaction, our credit research team conducts a review of a client’s credit quality. The information reviewed may include reports and filings, including any public credit ratings, financial statements, debt and equity analyst reports, and reviews of corporate credit spreads, stock prices, market capitalization, and other financial metrics. We conduct due diligence, including financial reviews of the client, monitor our clients’ credit quality on an ongoing basis, and provide summaries of these findings to management. \nAt December 31, 2024, 32.4% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent (as defined in \"Property Portfolio Information\"\n \nbelow) comes from properties leased to our investment grade clients, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies. At December 31, 2024, our top 20 clients (based on percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent) represented 36.4% of our annualized rent and 10 of these clients have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries or affiliates of investment grade companies.\nAsset Management Strategy\nIn addition to pursuing new properties for investment, we seek to increase earnings and dividends through active asset management.\nGenerally, our asset management efforts seek to achieve: \n•\nRent increases during and at the expiration of existing leases, when market conditions permit;\n•\nOptimum exposure to certain clients, industries, and markets through re-leasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties;\n•\nMaximum asset-level returns on properties that are renewed, re-leased or sold; and\n•\nAdditional value creation opportunities from the existing portfolio by leveraging internal capabilities to enhance individual properties, pursue alternative uses, and derive ancillary revenue.\nAs part of our ongoing credit and predictive analytics research, we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our clients, our clients’ industries, and the real estate locations in which we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality. \nOur disposition strategy remains a function of our active investment management approach, supported by several data-driven tools, and aims at further enhancing our portfolio and maximizing portfolio returns through the sale of select assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:\n•\nGenerate higher returns;\n•\nEnhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;\n•\nExtend our average remaining lease term; and/or\n•\nStrategically decrease client, industry, or geographic concentration.\nThe active management of the portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy of maintaining high occupancy.\nCapital Philosophy\nA primary objective of Realty Income is to deliver dependable monthly dividends to our stockholders that increase over time. To achieve this goal, we make a variety of capital allocation decisions, including with respect to our investments, leasing and releasing terms, and property development among other capital expenditures. We fund these expenditures by utilizing internally generated cash flow, dispositions, debt and equity issuances and term loan borrowings. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should represent the majority of our capital structure. We may issue common stock when we believe our share price supports accretive deployment of proceeds into additional properties, to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs, or shorter-term debt securities, and to repay or refinance debt. In addition, we continue to explore capital diversification initiatives, including the establishment of a fund business which we believe has the potential to expand our alternatives for sources of future capital. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to these sources of capital at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us. \nHuman Capital \nWe put great effort into cultivating an inclusive company culture. We seek to hire talented employees with diverse backgrounds and perspectives and look to foster an environment that allows for regular, open communication where capable team members have fulfilling careers and are encouraged to engage with and make a positive impact on our Company, its operations, its business partners, and the communities in which we operate. \n4\nTable of \nContents\nEmployees operate as \"One Team\" and, together, we are committed to providing an engaging work environment centered on our values of:\n•\nDo the Right Thing, \n•\nTake Ownership, \n•\nEmpower Each Other, \n•\nCelebrate Differences, and \n•\nGive More than We Take. \nRecruitment, Development and Retention\nAt the heart of our corporate culture lie our dedicated employees, who form the foundation of our organization, representing our most valuable assets. As of December 31, 2024, our workforce comprises 468 professionals. The majority of our talented team members are recruited and hired from the communities in which we operate, embodying our commitment to local engagement. To extend the scope of our talent acquisition efforts, we have implemented various initiatives, including college and high school internship programs. Our comprehensive approach encompasses a wide range of strategies, such as engaging with affinity associations, and fostering employee referrals. These measures ensure that we continually attract and embrace a diverse pool of candidates. Furthermore, we recognize that internal mobility within our organization unlocks yet another great source of talent. By encouraging our current employees to expand their skills and take on new challenges, we tap into a rich reservoir of potential that enhances our workforce's capabilities and reinforces our corporate culture. \nWe offer leadership development programs and train on critical topics such as ethics, insider trading, anti-discrimination and harassment, anti-bribery, consumer privacy, cybersecurity, workplace violence prevention, safety, and other Company policies. We provide professional development opportunities for One Team members and provide assistance and support to employees who are pursuing job-related licenses, certifications, and continuing education.  \nEmployee retention is essential for supporting a positive culture and productive workforce. Accordingly, we believe we offer competitive compensation and benefits packages. Benefits include medical, dental, and vision coverage for employees and their families, 401(k) or equivalent plans with Company matching opportunity; paid time-off or equivalent vacation; disability and life insurance; and, in years that the Company's performance meets certain goals, the ability to earn equity in the Company subject to applicable vesting periods.   \nAdditional information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives is available in our annual Proxy Statement and Sustainability Report, both of which can be found on our website. Information on our website, including our Sustainability Report, is not incorporated by reference into this annual report.\nEmployee Health, Safety and Wellbeing\nWe prioritize the health, safety, and wellbeing of our team members. Our wellbeing program is thoughtfully designed to empower employees by fostering personal and professional growth through engaging activities and educational initiatives. Centered around five key pillars—purpose, social connection, financial health, community engagement, and physical wellness—our program provides a holistic approach to enhancing overall wellbeing. In fostering a healthy work environment, we promote work-life balance by offering flexible schedules and providing discounted fitness programs, paid family leave, parental leave, onsite lactation rooms, an infant-at-work program, employee health fairs, and an employee assistance program, among other programs and services. \nGovernment Regulation\nGeneral\nCompliance with various governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with applicable federal, international, state and local governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, U.S. federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery and corruption laws and regulations, data privacy laws and regulations, sanctions restrictions, foreign laws and regulations, gaming laws and regulations and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, (\"ADA\"). We believe that our properties generally have the necessary permits and approvals needed and are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.\n5\nTable of \nContents\nEnvironmental Matters\nInvestments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regulate releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. While our tenants are generally primarily responsible for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, we as the property owner have faced and can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such liability regardless of our knowledge of the contamination; the timing of the contamination; the cause of the contamination; or the party responsible for the contamination of the property.\nSome of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near properties that contain or have contained storage tanks for petroleum products or that involve or involved the use of hazardous or toxic substances. Under certain laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant may be required to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases or threats of releases, and may be held liable to a government entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with actual or threatened contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the contamination. The liability may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may seek contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties for their fair share toward these costs. In addition, strict environmental laws regulate a variety of activities that can occur on a property, including the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, air emissions and water discharges. Such laws may impose fines or penalties for violations.\nEnvironmental laws also govern asbestos-containing materials (“ACM”). Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management to identify and warn, through signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to ACM in their building. The regulations also have employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to ACM. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations, and we could be subject to lawsuits if personal injury from exposure to ACM occurs. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of ACM when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of ACM and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with ACM. In addition, our properties have contained and may contain in the future or develop harmful mold or other airborne contaminants. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties has required us to and could require us to undertake in the future costly remediation to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. Further, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs.\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain a corporate website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make available, free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, and other reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports with, or furnish them to, the SEC. None of the information on our website is deemed to be part of this report.\nPROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION\nAt December 31, 2024, most of the properties in our portfolio were leased under net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) fixed increases, (2) increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients' gross sales above a specified level.\nWe define total portfolio annualized contractual rent as the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables, as of the balance sheet date, multiplied by 12, excluding percentage rent, interest income on loans and preferred equity investments, and including our pro rata share of such revenues from properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe total portfolio annualized contractual rent is a \nuseful supplemental operating measure, as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter. Total portfolio annualized contractual rent has not been reduced to reflect reserves recorded as adjustments to rental revenue under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (\"U.S. GAAP\") in the periods presented.\nTop 10 Industry Concentrations\nWe are engaged in a single business activity, which is the leasing of property to clients, generally on a net basis. That business activity spans various geographic boundaries and includes property types and clients engaged in various industries. Even though we have a single segment, we believe our investors continue to view diversification as a key component of our investment philosophy and so we believe it remains important to present certain information regarding our property portfolio classified according to the business of the respective clients, expressed as a percentage of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent:\nPercentage of Total Portfolio Annualized Contractual Rent by Industry\nAs of\nDec 31,\n2024\nDec 31,\n2023\nDec 31,\n2022\nDec 31,\n2021\nDec 31,\n2020\nConvenience Stores\n10.2%\n10.2%\n8.6%\n9.1%\n11.9%\nGrocery\n10.1\n11.4\n10.0\n10.2\n9.8\nDollar Stores\n6.4\n7.1\n7.4\n7.5\n7.6\nHome Improvement\n6.0\n5.9\n5.6\n5.1\n4.3\nRestaurants-Quick Service\n4.9\n5.2\n6.0\n6.6\n5.3\nDrug Stores\n4.7\n5.5\n5.7\n6.6\n8.2\nAutomotive Service\n4.5\n4.3\n4.0\n3.2\n2.7\nHealth and Fitness\n4.3\n3.9\n4.4\n4.7\n6.7\nRestaurants-Casual Dining\n4.0\n4.4\n5.1\n5.9\n2.8\nGaming\n3.2\n3.9\n2.9\n—\n—\nProperty Type Composition\nThe following table sets forth certain property type information regarding our property portfolio as of December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nProperty Type\nNumber of\nProperties\nApproximate\nLeasable\nSquare Feet \n(1)\nTotal Portfolio Annualized Contractual Rent\nPercentage of Total Portfolio Annualized Contractual Rent\nRetail\n14,983\n213,026,200\n$\n3,944,534 \n79.4 \n%\nIndustrial\n566\n116,138,200\n722,251 \n14.5 \nGaming\n2\n5,053,400\n160,854 \n3.2 \nOther \n(2)\n70\n5,154,100\n143,185 \n2.9 \nTotal\n15,621\n339,371,900\n$\n4,970,824 \n100.0 \n%\n(1)\nRepresents leasable building square footage and includes our portfolio of unconsolidated joint ventures based on ownership percentage.

incorporated by reference, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. When used in this annual report, the words “estimated,” “anticipated,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “continue,” “should,” “may,” “likely,” “plans,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include discussions of our business and portfolio; growth strategies and intentions to acquire or dispose of properties (including geographies, timing, partners, clients and terms); re-leases, re-development and speculative development of properties and expenditures related thereto; future operations and results; the announcement of operating results, strategy, plans, and the intentions of management; statements made regarding our share repurchase program; settlement of shares of common stock sold pursuant to forward sale confirmations under our At-the-Market (“ATM”) Program; dividends, including the amount, timing and payments of dividends; and trends in our business, including trends in the market for long-term leases of freestanding, single-client properties. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about us which may cause our actual future results to differ materially from expected results. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are, among others, our continued qualification as a real estate investment trust; general domestic and foreign business, economic, or financial conditions; competition; fluctuating interest and currency rates; inflation and its impact on our clients and us; access to debt and equity capital markets and other sources of funding (including the terms and partners of such funding); continued volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets and broader financial markets; other risks inherent in the real estate business including our clients' solvency, client defaults under leases, increased client bankruptcies, potential liability relating to environmental matters, illiquidity of real estate investments, and potential damages from natural disasters; impairments in the value of our real estate assets; changes in domestic and foreign income tax laws and rates; property ownership through co-investment ventures, funds, joint ventures, partnerships and other arrangements which may transfer or limit control of the underlying investments; epidemics or pandemics including measures taken to limit their spread, the impacts on us, our business, our clients, and the economy generally; the loss of key personnel; the outcome of any legal proceedings to which we are a party or which may occur in the future; acts of terrorism and war; and the anticipated benefits from mergers and acquisitions.\nAdditional factors that may cause risks and uncertainties include those discussed in the sections entitled “Business,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report on \nForm 10-K\n, for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future plans and performance and speak only as of the date this annual report was filed with the SEC.

We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements or publicly release the results of any forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date these statements were made.\n6\nTable of \nContents",
    "item1a": "Item 1A:\n      \nRisk Factors\nThis “Risk Factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders.” Unless expressly stated otherwise, the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of preferred stock that may be outstanding from time to time, while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of preferred stock that may be outstanding from time to time. \nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIn order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties. The acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures.\nWe face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties. We expect competition from businesses, individuals, fiduciary accounts and plans, and other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing. This competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase.\nNegative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential clients, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new clients, re-lease space, collect rent or renew leases, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth.\nCash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to our clients on economically favorable terms and to collect rent from our clients on a timely basis. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:\n•\nLack of demand in areas where our properties are located;\n•\nInability to retain existing clients and attract new clients;\n•\nOversupply of space and changes in market rental rates;\n•\nDeclines in our clients’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations (including as a result from changes in consumer behaviors or preferences impacting our clients' operations), economic downturns and competition within their industries from other operators;\n•\nDefaults by and bankruptcies of clients, failure of clients to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of our clients to comply with their contractual obligations;\n•\nChanges in laws, rules or regulations that negatively impact us, our clients or our properties;\n•\nGeneral economic, political and financial market conditions;\n•\nEpidemics, pandemics or outbreaks of illness, disease or virus that affect countries or regions in which our clients and their parent companies operate or in which our properties or corporate headquarters are located;\n•\nChanges in consumer behaviors (e.g., decrease in discretionary consumer spending), preferences or demographics impacting our clients' operations; \n•\nSupply chain disruptions;\n•\nEconomic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located; and\n•\nDeterioration of physical condition of our properties.\nIf clients do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties. Leases that are renewed and new leases for properties that are re-leased, or leases that we assume as part of portfolio acquisitions or strategic mergers and acquisitions can have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms or leases that we negotiate directly, may require us to incur significant costs such as renovations improvements, or lease transaction costs. Negative market conditions may cause us to sell properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. Any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and service our indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. In a weakened financial condition, our clients may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them.\nAt any time, any of our clients may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. As a result, a client may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, fail to maintain the property or otherwise pay its required expenses under the terms of the lease, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any client bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of our client’s lease and material losses to us. Further, the occurrence of a client bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish or eliminate the income we receive from our client’s lease or leases. A bankruptcy court could authorize a client to terminate one or more of its leases with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt client for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases (it is also possible that we may not receive any unpaid \n7\nTable of \nContents\nfuture rent under terminated leases) or we may elect not to pursue claims against a client for terminated leases. Claims we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full, or at all. Client bankruptcies affecting a given property may also adversely impact our ability to quickly re-lease that property at favorable terms, or at all. Moreover, if a client’s leases are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy, we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions, reducing amounts we receive under those leases. As a result, client bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness.\nDownturns in any of the industries in which our clients operate could adversely affect our clients, which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock. In addition, some of our properties are leased to clients that may have limited financial and other resources and, therefore, they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional, national or international economy. Furthermore, we have made and may continue to make investments that fall outside of our historical focus on acquiring freestanding, single-client, net-lease retail properties located in the U.S. As a result, we are exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new investments, co-investment ventures, development, industries, property types, revenue-generating activities and/or new jurisdictions outside the U.S. These risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties, engaging in new types of revenue-generating activities, new types of real estate locations and lease structures, new co-investment ventures, and the laws and culture of non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT, it could adversely impact us, and the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities.\nWe are organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we cannot make any assurances that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. As we have recently expanded into new geographies and transactional structures, and may continue to do so in the future, the analyses of our REIT qualification, and our ability to ensure such qualification, have become, and may become in the future, more complex. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains). If we fail to satisfy any of the requirements for qualification as a REIT, we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to qualify as a REIT. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:\n•\nWe would be required to pay regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income;\n•\nWe would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income;\n•\nWe could be subject to a federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes;\n•\nWe could be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost;\n•\nWe would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and\n•\nThis treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.\nEven if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we may be subject to certain federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxes on our income and property. For example, if we have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and, in some cases, non-U.S. taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.\n8\nTable of \nContents\nChanges in U.S. or Non-U.S. tax laws and regulations, including changes to tax rates, and legislative or other actions may adversely affect us or our investors.\nFederal income taxation laws are constantly under review and may change. Additionally, the governments of many of the other countries in which we operate may enact changes to the tax laws of such countries. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect us or our investors, including holders of our common stock or debt securities. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect us or our investors. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us as well as the amount of tax we are required to pay. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT. In addition, the tax treatment of certain of our sale-leaseback transactions could change, which could make such sale-leaseback transactions less attractive to potential sellers and lessees and negatively impact our operations.\nDistribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility.\nTo maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding net capital gains, each year. We also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains) each year. In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years. We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT.\nFuture issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock.\nOur future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional capital. Raising capital through the issuance of equity securities, including securities exchangeable into our equity securities or convertible debt securities, can dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. The interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to equity incentive plans. Our Board of Directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend, voting and other rights as determined by our Board of Directors (such as the shares of preferred stock that were issued in connection with the closing of the merger with Spirit) which could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock.\nWe may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership that, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of our common stock, resulting in stockholder dilution. This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of, or refinance the debt on, the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain. Similarly, we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. In the event we take any action that causes taxable gain to be allocated to these contributors, we may be required to indemnify them under tax protection agreements. These restrictions could limit our ability to manage, control, sell or refinance an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions. \nWe are subject\n \nto risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing.\nWe intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our $4.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and our $3.0 billion commercial paper programs. \nOur revolving credit facility grants us the option, subject to obtaining lender commitments and other customary conditions, to expand the borrowing limits thereunder to up to $5.25 billion. Our term loan agreement (the “2023 term loan agreement”) governs our 2023 term loans, pursuant to which we have borrowed an aggregate of approximately $1.0 billion in multicurrency borrowings. The 2023 term loan agreement also permits us to incur \n9\nTable of \nContents\nadditional term loans, up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion in total borrowings, pursuant to an accordion expansion feature, which is subject to obtaining lender commitments and other customary conditions. The term loans pursuant to our 2023 term loan agreement mature in January 2026. At December 31, 2024, we also had a total of $22.9 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities (excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums, deferred financing costs and basis adjustments on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges), including approximately $5.0 billion denominated in Sterling (of which $1.1 billion is related to our privately placed Sterling notes), $1.1 billion denominated in Euro thereunder, and approximately $81.3 million of outstanding mortgage debt (excluding unamortized net discounts and deferred financing costs).\nIn connection with the consummation of the closing of the merger (the “Merger”) with Spirit on January 23, 2024, we effectively assumed Spirit’s existing term loans with various lenders. Specifically, on January 22, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated term loan agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed $800 million in aggregate total borrowings, $300 million of which matures on August 22, 2025 and $500 million of which matures on August 20, 2027 (the “$800 million term loan agreement”), and an amended and restated term loan agreement pursuant to which we borrowed $500 million in aggregate total borrowings which matures on June 16, 2025. The $800 million term loan agreement and the $500 million term loan agreement became effective upon the closing of the Merger on January 23, 2024. Our A3/A- credit ratings provide for a borrowing rate of 80 basis points over the applicable benchmark rate, which includes adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") for US Dollar-denominated loans, adjusted Sterling Overnight Indexed Average (“SONIA”) for Sterling-denominated loans, and Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) for Euro-denominated loans. In conjunction with closing, we executed one-year variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps which fix our per annum interest rate at 5.0% over the initial term. In addition, as a result of the Merger, all outstanding secured indebtedness, liabilities, and other indebtedness of Spirit and its subsidiaries, including $2.75 billion of additional senior unsecured notes that were originally issued by Spirit Realty Capital, L.P., substantially all of which were exchanged for senior unsecured notes issued by us, became indebtedness and liabilities of ours or our subsidiaries, as the case may be, which substantially increased the total secured indebtedness and the total liabilities and other indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries.\nPursuant to our unsecured commercial paper programs we may offer and sell up to $3.0 billion of commercial paper at any time. We use our revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes issued under the commercial paper programs. Specifically, we maintain unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility equal to the aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper programs from time to time. We may in the future enter into amendments and restatements of our revolving credit facility and term loan facilities, or enter into new revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities, and any such amended, restated or replacement revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities may increase the amounts we are entitled to borrow, subject to customary conditions, compared to our current revolving credit facility and term loan facilities, or we may incur other indebtedness. We may also in the future increase the size of our commercial paper programs or establish new commercial paper programs. We expect that we will continue to use our current and any new revolving credit facilities we may enter into (in each case as the same may be expanded, amended or restated, if applicable, from time to time), as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes issued under our current or any new commercial paper programs that we may maintain from time to time. \nTo the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. As a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt or to pay dividends on our common stock. We also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility, term loan facilities, and commercial paper programs are variable (subject to our interest rate swaps on our term loan facilities, in effect from time to time), and the interest rates on any credit facilities and term loan facilities we may enter into in the future may be variable, and could therefore increase over time. In addition, commercial paper borrowings are short-term obligations and the interest rate on newly issued commercial paper varies according to market conditions at the time of issuance. Similarly, some of the indebtedness to which we have become subject to subsequent to the Merger may also bear interest at variable rates. In addition, while we may enter into hedging and other derivatives instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in borrowing and currency rates, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these arrangements or they may be insufficient to mitigate our exposure. We also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. Given past disruptions in the financial markets and ongoing global financial uncertainties, we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may be unwilling or unable to lend us money.\nWe have incurred and may continue to incur indebtedness that is denominated in local currencies to fund our international investments and operations. However, it is possible that such indebtedness may be insufficient or may \n10\nTable of \nContents\nbe on unacceptable terms requiring us to use non-local currency indebtedness. In such event, we may be subject to foreign exchange rate volatility. While we may enter into hedging and other derivatives instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these arrangements or these arrangements may be insufficient to mitigate our exposure. \nOur revolving credit facility, our term loan facilities, and our mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or, in certain cases, prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock. The credit agreements governing our revolving credit facility and term loan facilities provide that, if an event of default (as defined in the credit agreements, as applicable) exists, we may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or any outstanding preferred stock, during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of (i) the sum of 95% of our adjusted funds from operations (as defined in the credit agreements, as applicable) for that period plus the aggregate amount of cash distributions made to holders of our outstanding preferred stock for that period, and (ii) the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our stockholders in order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and to avoid the payment of income or excise taxes that would otherwise be imposed under specified sections of the Code on income we do not distribute to our stockholders, except we may repurchase or redeem shares of our outstanding preferred stock, if any, with net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock. \nThe credit agreements each provide that, in the event of a failure to pay principal, interest, or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreements, we and our subsidiaries (other than our wholly-owned subsidiaries) may not pay dividends or make other distributions on (except for (a) distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and (b) dividends and distributions described in (ii) above), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock. If any such event of default under the applicable credit agreements (or under any other credit agreement or debt instrument with similar terms that we may in the future enter into or be subject to) were to occur, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities which could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock or the amount of interest and principal we are able to pay on our indebtedness, or prevent us from paying those dividends, other distributions, interest or principal altogether, and may adversely affect our ability to qualify, or prevent us from qualifying, as a REIT.\nOur indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock, outstanding preferred stock, and our debt securities, including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements; requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and general corporate requirements; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.\nIf we default under a credit facility, loan agreement, or other debt instrument, the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and, in the case of secured indebtedness, to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral. Moreover, a default under a single loan or debt instrument may trigger cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in other indebtedness and debt instruments, giving the holders of such other indebtedness and debt instruments similar rights to demand immediate repayment and to seize and sell any collateral.\nReal estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue.\nWe are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate. We face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur, and distributions on our capital stock. Additional real estate ownership risks include:\n•\nAdverse changes in general or local economic conditions;\n•\nChanges in supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;\n•\nChanges in interest rates and operating expenses (including energy costs, shortages and rationing);\n•\nCompetition within an industry and for our clients;\n11\nTable of \nContents\n•\nChanges in market rents;\n•\nInability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases;\n•\nFlat leases, leases with below market rental rates or renewal of leases at lower rental rates;\n•\nInability to collect rental revenue from our clients due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;\n•\nChanges in tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate; \n•\nUninsured property liability;\n•\nProperty damage or casualty losses;\n•\nUnexpected expenditures for capital improvements, including requirements to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws;\n•\nThe need to periodically renovate and repair our properties;\n•\nRisks assumed as manager for development or redevelopment projects;\n•\nPhysical or weather-related damage to properties;\n•\nThe potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time;\n•\nActs of terrorism and war;\n•\nChanges in consumer behaviors, preferences or demographics; \n•\nThe impacts of extreme weather events or climate change and the varying local, state, and federal regulatory landscape impacting properties to address the impacts of climate change; and \n•\nActs of God and other factors beyond the control of our management.\nReal estate property investments are illiquid. We may not be able to acquire or dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to quickly buy, sell or exchange any of our properties, or to contribute our properties to co-investment, including in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited and U.S. and non-U.S. tax and regulatory regimes and authorities - competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties, availability of capital, economic and market conditions and other factors beyond our control, may impose or have the effect of restricting or limiting our ability to sell or contribute properties. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value, at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us, for any property that we are required to sell or contribute for liquidity reasons. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our mergers and acquisitions, acquisitions, and expansion opportunities under prevailing market conditions. We are regularly engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, underwriting, and negotiating possible acquisition transactions. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future mergers and acquisitions or acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize expected cash yields, integration results, operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies, or other benefits. In addition, we have historically engaged in, and may again in the future engage in strategic acquisitions of operating businesses, in which case we would be subject to risks related to our ability to successfully underwrite such target's businesses effectively and to combine such target's operations with ours in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve operating efficiencies (including with the integration of information technology systems), cost savings and efficiencies, revenues, synergies or other benefits either in the time frame anticipated or at all. Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms, our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions.\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions of properties (including through the use of alternative lease and acquisition structures such as joint ventures, partnerships, fund and other structures) or engage in other revenue-generating businesses, that fall outside our historical focus on wholly-owned freestanding, single-client, net lease retail locations in the U.S. We may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new investments, property types (e.g., non-retail businesses), geographies, lease and acquisition structures, and clients who engage in non-retail businesses. For instance, while we have historically predominantly owned and leased commercial properties under long-term, net lease agreements, as we expand into new verticals, the composition of our lease portfolio may include a higher concentration of alternative lease structures, under which we may be primarily \n12\nTable of \nContents\nresponsible for other expenses and liabilities with respect to the property, including property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. These risks may be enhanced by our limited experience in managing these new investments or activities, property types, geographies, lease and acquisition structures, clients and the laws and/or culture of non-U.S. geographies.\nAs a property owner, we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities.\nInvestments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. We could be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest for environmental contamination. Further, laws and regulations governing environmental contamination change and we have been, and in the future may be, subject to additional liability by virtue of these changes. We can face such liability regardless of our knowledge of the contamination; the timing of the contamination; the cause of the contamination; or the party responsible for the contamination of the property. \nThere may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware. Our portfolio includes properties leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, to operators of oil change and tune-up facilities, and operators that use chemicals and other waste products. These facilities and some other of our properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or storage tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances. Certain of our other properties, including those leased for industrial purposes, may also involve operations or activities that could give rise to environmental liabilities or could have been built using asbestos or other building materials that require owners or operators to undertake special precautions including removal, abatement, or adequately train or inform those that come in contact with such materials.\nThe presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our client's ability to continue to operate that property or our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third-party liability claims. Although our leases generally require our clients to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the clients’ activities on the properties, we could nevertheless be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no assurance that our clients could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition, or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness. \nWhile we maintain environmental insurance policies, our insurance could be unavailable or insufficient to address an environmental liability and/or we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost or at all. Our clients are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of clients’ activities on the properties. However, we acquire properties with existing leases in place and the indemnities and other lease terms can have different indemnification requirements including for environmental matters than what is provided for in our leases that we negotiate directly with clients. It is also possible that one or more of our clients could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations or such environmental contamination may predate our client's lease term, and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming and attracting third-party investment in our anticipated fund business, investing in new or existing co-investment ventures or funds, and managing properties through our anticipated fund business or other co-investment ventures.\nAs previously publicly disclosed, we anticipate forming a fund business, and may explore options to form other co-investment ventures in the future. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in our anticipated fund business or other co-investment ventures. We currently intend to develop and acquire properties through our new fund business and co-investment ventures and we may also make investments in other entities at our discretion in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to form our anticipated fund business and co-investment ventures on the timeline expected, or at all, attract third-party investment or that additional investments in our anticipated fund business or other co-investment ventures to develop or acquire properties in the future will be successful, or that such anticipated fund business or other co-investment ventures will improve our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from our existing or future investments. \nOur anticipated fund business or other co-investment ventures are expected to involve certain additional risks that we do not currently otherwise face, including the risks inherent in owning, operating and managing one or more funds, risks related to our ability to negotiate third-party investments, such as valuation, operational limitations, \n13\nTable of \nContents\nmanagement fee structures and other incentive fees, on terms that are beneficial to us, and the inherent conflicts that may exist in allocating investment opportunities effectively between us and the fund or such other co-investment ventures. \nIn addition, the same factors that may impact the valuation of our existing portfolio, as otherwise discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may also impact the portfolios to be held by the funds or co-investment ventures and could result in other than temporary impairment of our investment and a reduction in fee revenues, if any. Our fund business may be subject to some or all of the risks more fully described in \"We may engage in development, speculative development, or expansion projects or invest in new asset classes, which would subject us to additional risks that could negatively impact our operations.\"\nSuch risks may adversely impact our anticipated fund business's or our other co-investment ventures' financial position or results of operation.\nWe are subject to additional risks from our international investments and debt. \nWe have acquired and may continue to make investments outside of the U.S. These investments may expose us to a variety of risks that are different from and in addition to those commonly found in the U.S. Our international investments are subject to additional risks, including:\n•\nThe laws, rules and regulations applicable in such jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including those related to property ownership and control by foreign entities;\n•\nComplying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including corruption, employment, data protection, energy usage, health, safety, environmental regulations which may require capital expenditures to maintain or bring our foreign properties into compliance with applicable regulations and/or may require disclosure of various environmental, social and governance matters, and the compliance risks and costs related thereto;\n•\nFluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar (including risks related to their impact on our results of operations, hedging and other derivative arrangements used to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates, translational reporting risks, and exchange controls);\n•\nAs we may not have or have only a limited number of properties within a jurisdiction, our experience in that market and with local business may be limited, and our operating costs may be disproportionately higher until the number of properties within a jurisdiction grows;\n•\nWe may face challenges with expanding into current or new jurisdictions, such as identifying and securing investment opportunities, hiring and retaining employees, extended time periods for acquiring or disposing of investments, which may increase the cost of funding an investment, and potentially experiencing different cultural and business practices related to employees, rent adjustments, ground leases, and property ownership requirements and limitations;\n•\nChallenges in establishing effective systems, infrastructure, controls and procedures to manage and regulate operations in different regions and to monitor and ensure compliance with applicable regulations, such as applicable laws related to corrupt practices, employment, licensing, construction, energy usage, climate change or environmental compliance;\n•\nUnexpected, new or other changes in regulatory requirements (including disclosure requirements), tax, tariffs, trade barriers and other laws within jurisdictions outside the U.S. or between the U.S. and such jurisdictions;\n•\nPotentially adverse tax consequences with respect to our properties and/or investment vehicles;\n•\nInitial limited investments within certain regions or countries may result in industry or client concentration risks;\n•\nThe impact of regional or country-specific business cycles, inflation and economic instability, including deterioration in political relations with the U.S., instability in, or further withdrawals from, the European Union or other international trade alliances or agreements; and\n•\nPolitical instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, acts of war, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities.\nWe also engage external property managers and other third parties, who assist with managing our international properties. If a property manager or third party fails to meet its obligations or terminates its services, we may need to find a replacement; however, these services may be on less favorable terms and conditions, or we may not be able to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner or at all. \nWe have incurred and may continue to incur indebtedness that is denominated in local currencies to fund our international investments and operations. However, it is possible that such indebtedness may be insufficient or may be on unacceptable terms requiring us to use non-local currency indebtedness. In such event, we may be subject to foreign exchange rate volatility which may be impacted by various factors, including those described above. While we may enter into hedging and other derivatives instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign \n14\nTable of \nContents\nexchange rates, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these arrangements or these arrangements may be insufficient to mitigate our exposure. For more information, see “—We are subject to risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing.” If we are unable to adequately address these risks, they could have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nWe may engage in development, speculative development, or expansion projects or invest in new asset classes, which would subject us to additional risks that could negatively impact our operations. \nWe may engage in development, speculative development, or other expansion projects, which could require us to raise additional capital and obtain additional state and local permits. A decision by any governmental agency not to issue a required permit or substantial delays in the permitting process could cause us to incur penalties, delay us from receiving rental payments or result in us receiving reduced rental payments, or prevent us from pursuing the development, speculative development, or expansion project altogether. Additionally, any such new development, speculative development, or expansion project may not operate at designed capacity or may cost more to operate than we expect. The inability to successfully complete development, speculative development, expansion or other value-added projects or to complete them on a timely basis could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have and may continue to make investments and utilize transaction structures that are outside of our traditional business, including entering into new asset classes, such as casinos and vertical farms, and entering into (or expanding our use of) new transaction structures, such as strategic co-investment ventures, joint ventures, funds, lending, and increased exploration of sale-leaseback transactions. We invest and may continue to invest in new or different assets or enter into new transaction structures that may or may not be closely related to our current business and which could require new or additional processes, controls, systems and personnel. These new assets and transaction structures may have new, different or increased risks than what we are currently exposed to in our business and we may not be able to manage these risks successfully. Such risks include: \n•\nWhen investing in new assets or transaction structures, we will be exposed to the risk that those assets or structures, or the income generated thereby, will affect our ability to meet the requirements to maintain our REIT status, or will subject us to additional regulatory requirements or limitations;\n•\nOur partners or investors may share certain approval rights over major decisions or have the ability to appoint persons to governing bodies;\n•\nOur partners or investors may seek to exit or redeem their investment, and may do so simultaneously, causing the venture or fund to seek capital to satisfy these requests on less than optimal terms;\n•\nIf our partners or investors fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions, then we may choose to contribute such capital or the venture or fund may have to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness on less than optimal terms;\n•\nOur partners or investors may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the venture or fund and adversely impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations;\n•\nThe venture or fund or other governing agreements may restrict the transfer of an interest in the co-investment venture or fund or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms;\n•\nOur relationships with our partners or investors are likely to be contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in such event, the venture or fund may terminate or we may not continue to invest in or manage the assets underlying such relationships resulting in a decrease in our assets under management and a reduction in fee revenues; and\n•\nDisputes between us and our partners or investors may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable co-investment venture or fund to additional risk.\nIf we are not able to successfully manage the risks associated with such new assets, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProperty taxes may increase without notice.\nReal estate property taxes on our properties (including properties we develop or acquire) may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. While the majority of our leases are under a net lease structure, some or all of such property taxes may not be collectible from our clients, and, as we continue to expand into new verticals, the concentration of our leases under which we are primarily responsible for property taxes may increase, enhancing our exposure to such risks.\n15\nTable of \nContents\nWe may face extensive regulations from gaming and other regulatory authorities regarding current and future gaming properties.\nAs a landlord of a gaming facility or future gaming facilities, we may be impacted by the risks associated with the gaming industry. The ownership, operation, and management of gaming facilities are subject to extensive regulation. Gaming authorities also retain great discretion such that gaming regulations can impact our gaming clients, individuals associated with the operation of gaming properties, and us as the owner of the real estate and landlord related to such facilities. Gaming laws and regulations can impact all facets of a gaming property, including but not limited to gaming, service and consumption of alcoholic beverages, hours of operation, staffing and licensing of employees, marketing, currency transactions including compliance with the Foreign Corruption Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and safety and security of the gaming property. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted, which could adversely affect our operating results, and may also result in additional taxes or licensing fees imposed on us and our gaming clients. In addition, subject to certain administrative due process requirements, gaming regulators generally have broad authority to conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our officers or certain investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards and suitability to hold a gaming license, and to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke, or suspend any gaming license, registration, or finding of suitability or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered, or found suitable or qualified as a licensee. As a result, our ability to obtain or maintain our required licenses and approvals, or avoid penalties related thereto, may be subject to risks, including risks outside of our control, and cannot be predicted. \nWere a tenant unable to continue to perform under a lease, because of the highly regulated nature of the industry, it may be difficult to re-lease gaming properties. This difficulty may be exacerbated to the extent the gaming property is located in a geography that does not have an expansive gaming footprint, such as one of the properties, in which we are invested. A transfer of interest, including a new lease, or a new management contract with a new operator will likely require approval of regulators and the licensing of a new gaming operator tenant. \nAn uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.\nOur leases generally require our clients to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, clients are generally required, at the client’s expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, general liability and property damage insurance policies. The insurance policies our clients are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily excluded improvements. \nMany of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by our clients as part of their risk management programs. Additionally, we have obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the clients fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss. We do not carry insurance for certain losses and certain types of losses may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. However, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. We also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies, and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire.\nIn addition, although we obtain title insurance policies on our properties to help protect us and our properties against title defects (such as adverse claims of ownership, liens or other encumbrances), there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover. If a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property, cause a financial misstatement or damage our reputation.\n16\nTable of \nContents\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur U.S. properties are generally required to comply with the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities,” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants. The clients to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions and, in many cases, the clients are generally obligated to cover costs associated with compliance pursuant to the terms of their applicable leases. If required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these clients to cover costs could be adversely affected. In such circumstances and where the expenditures are otherwise the responsibility of the landlord, we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, our properties must be in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with climate change.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with the effects of climate change, and a market shift to a lower carbon economy, and may be subject to further risks in the future. A failure to adequately adapt to climate change could adversely affect our business through both chronic and acute perils including, but not limited to, extreme weather, changes in precipitation and temperature, and rising sea levels, all of which may result in physical damage to, or a decrease in demand for, our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions, and may adversely impact consumer behaviors, preferences and spending for our clients, and insurance costs, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations under our leases, or our ability to re-lease the properties in the future. In addition, should the impact of climate change be severe or occur for lengthy periods of time, connectivity, labor and supply chains could impact business continuity for ourselves and our clients. \nThe effects of climate change may lead to increased costs for us and our clients to adapt to the demands and expectations of lowering our carbon footprint, including with respect to setting carbon reduction targets, implementing renewable energy, retrofitting properties to be more energy efficient and implementing longer-term low-carbon solutions. These risks could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The structure of our leasing contracts and operating model presents challenges in partnering with clients to implement necessary decarbonization initiatives.\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from regulators and other stakeholders regarding sustainability practices and reporting could impact our business practices, cause us to incur additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nWe seek to promote effective energy efficiency and other sustainability strategies and compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations related to climate change, both internally and with our partners across our value chain, including with our clients. Our sustainability strategies and efforts to comply with the various federal, state and international laws and regulations related to climate change could result in significant capital expenditures to improve our existing properties, properties we may acquire, and other business practices. Any changes to such laws and regulations could also result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures at our properties. If we are unable to comply with laws and regulations on climate change or implement effective sustainability strategies, our reputation among our clients and investors may be damaged and we may incur fines and/or penalties.  \nTenants of net-leased properties are typically responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management of the properties. This lack of control over our net-leased properties makes it difficult for us to collect property-level environmental data and to enforce related initiatives, which may impact our ability to comply with certain shareholder expectations or regulatory disclosure requirements to which we are subject or to comply with reporting frameworks or other established frameworks and standards. If we are unable to successfully collect the data necessary to comply with these disclosure requirements, standards or expectations, we may be subject to increased regulatory risk, of if such data is incomplete or unfavorable, our relationship with our investors or other stakeholders, our stock price, and our access to capital may be negatively impacted.\n17\nTable of \nContents\nAdditionally, our sustainability disclosures may reflect aspirational goals, targets, and other expectations and assumptions, which are necessarily uncertain and may not be realized. If we fail to satisfy the environmental, social, and governance expectations of investors, tenants and other stakeholders, our initiatives are not executed as planned, or we do not satisfy our goals, then our third-party ratings, reputation and financial results could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that any of our sustainability strategies will result in reduced operating costs, higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter our existing clients from relocating to properties owned by our competitors. In addition, both advocates and opponents to certain sustainability matters are increasingly resorting to a range of activism forms, including shareholder proposals, media campaigns and litigation, to advance their perspectives. To the extent we are subject to such activism, it may require us to incur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the price of our stock and our financial condition and results of operations. \nOur charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock.\nOur charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to, among other purposes, assist us in maintaining our status as a REIT for U.S. federal and/or state income tax purposes. For example, our charter restricts any person from acquiring beneficial or constructive ownership of more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of common stock. These restrictions could have anti-takeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe value of certain of our investment in real property may be reduced as the result of the expiration or loss of local tax abatements, tax credit programs, or other governmental incentives.\nCertain of our investments have the benefit of governmental tax incentives aimed at inducing property users to relocate to incentivize development in areas and neighborhoods which have not historically seen robust commercial development. These incentives typically have specific sunset provisions and may be subject to governmental discretion in the eligibility or award of the applicable incentives. The expiration of these incentive programs or the inability of potential clients or users to be eligible for or to obtain governmental approval of the incentives, or the inability to remain compliant with such programs, may have an adverse effect on the value of our investment, cash flow and net income, and may result in impairment charges.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control, including:\n•\nPrevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities;\n•\nThe market for similar securities issued by other REITs;\n•\nGeneral economic, political and financial market conditions;\n•\nThe financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our clients and our competitors;\n•\nChanges in tax, legal and regulatory obligations, including without limitation due to changes in federal, state, or local governing administrations;\n•\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings;\n•\nChanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry;\n•\nChanges in our mix of investments and revenue-generating activities over time;\n•\nChanges in our credit ratings;\n•\nActual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors; and \n•\nFailure to achieve the perceived benefits of our strategic acquisitions and/or engagement in new verticals, investment structures or other revenue-generating activities. \nPrices of common stock and debt securities in the U.S., trading markets have experienced extreme price fluctuations, and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period. As a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\n18\nTable of \nContents\nLitigation risks could affect our business.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims including those that may arise out of mergers and acquisitions, acquisitions, development opportunities, dispositions, disputes with clients, joint ventures, funds, and other strategic transactions. An unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. It is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry or retain employees to the same extent as in the past.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events (e.g., pandemics or epidemics) may negatively affect our operations, the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our clients, our business or the U.S. or world generally. If events like these were to occur, they could materially interrupt our business operations, cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the U.S. or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities. It could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.\nWe, like all businesses, are subject to cyber-attacks and security incidents, which threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and information resources. Cyber-attacks are malicious cyber activity and a security incident is a successful cyber-attack that has the potential to expose sensitive data, internal systems, or otherwise disrupt business operations. Those attacks and incidents may be due to intentional or unintentional acts by employees, contractors or third-parties, who seek to gain unauthorized access to our or our service providers’ systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information through malware, computer viruses, ransomware, social engineering (e.g., phishing attachments to e-mails) or other vectors. \nThe risk of a cybersecurity breach or operational disruption, particularly through a cyber incident, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased, particularly as remote working has become more common. Our information technology (“IT”) networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our clients. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption (such as the implementation of systems and/or vendors that provide constant monitoring of our IT networks and related systems for cyber-attacks and incidents); however, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.\nWhile we maintain some of our own critical IT networks and related systems, we depend on third-parties to provide important software, technologies, tools and a broad array of services and functions, such as payroll, human resources, electronic communications, data storage, and certain finance and treasury functions, among others. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process, transmit and store sensitive data, within our own systems and utilize those of third-party providers, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our clients, suppliers, business partners and investors, as well as personally identifiable information.\nOur measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats may not be successful in preventing a security incident or data breach or limiting the effects of such a breach. This is particularly so because attack methodologies change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and we also may be unable to investigate or remediate incidents \n19\nTable of \nContents\nbecause attackers are increasingly using techniques and tools designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. Our clients, joint venture partners, investors or other third parties with whom we do business may themselves become subject to cyberattacks or security incidents, over which we may have no control, and which could have an indirect adverse impact on them, us or our business relationship.\nThe primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber attack or security incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our clients, reputational damage, and private data exposure. We could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address an attack or incident, which may not be covered or fully covered by our insurance and which may involve payments for investigations, forensic analyses, legal advice, public relations advice, system repair or replacement, or other services, in addition to any remedies or relief that may result from legal proceedings. Our financial results may be negatively impacted by any such attacks and incidents or any resulting negative media attention. Further, while we carry cyber liability insurance, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses related to such events.\nVolatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements.\nVarious estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements, including estimates related to asset and liability valuations (or potential impairments), and receivables. Often these estimates require the use of market data values and involve estimates of future performance or receivables collectability all of which can be difficult to accurately predict. Although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates, it is possible actual results may differ from these estimates.\nInherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements, disclosure controls and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement and disclosure accuracy and safeguarding of assets. Failures in our internal controls could result in adverse consequences in our financial reporting and operations, including delays, additional costs, impairment of our ability to access capital, adverse impacts to investor confidence, regulatory review, or litigation.\nOur business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness, and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot make any assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us, the market price of our common stock, and may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital.\nHistorically, there have been periods where the global equity and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of equity and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms, which may adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions. A prolonged downturn in the equity or credit markets may cause us to refinance at higher rates, seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to buy or sell properties, may adversely affect the price we purchase or receive for properties, as we and prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing. These events in the equity and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. These disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and debt securities, the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties, as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general.\n20\nTable of \nContents\nInflation (including prolonged inflationary periods) may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIncreased inflation or anticipated inflationary periods, such as the period in which we are currently in, could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation and other costs (including increases in employment and other fees and expenses). Government regulations may limit the indices we can utilize in lease adjustments thereby limiting our ability to increase rent. Even though net leases are structured so as to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our clients’ ability to pay rent. The U.K. government plans to migrate away from the Retail Price Index (\"RPI\"), to alternatives such as the Consumer Price Index including owner occupiers' housing costs, that may result in a lower measure of inflation and, in turn, have a negative impact on our lease revenue currently tied to RPI in the U.K. Inflationary periods may cause us to experience increased costs of financing, making it difficult to incur or refinance debt at attractive rates or at all, and may adversely affect the investments we make if the cost of financing is in excess of our anticipated earnings from such investment thereby limiting the investments we can make. To the extent periods of high inflation are prolonged, these results may be exacerbated. \nWe are subject to complex and changing laws, regulations, policies, and executive orders, which exposes us to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on our business.\nWe are subject to complex and changing laws, regulations, policies, and executive orders, locally, internationally and federally, and the enforcement and interpretations thereof, and compliance with these laws, regulations, policies and executive orders is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, policies, and executive orders, or the enforcement and interpretations thereof, can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by increasing costs, negatively impacting the creditworthiness of our existing or potential clients, changing the interpretations or enforceability of existing business relationships or agreements, creating legal liability or reputational harm to the Company or distractions for management, generating operational disruptions, and requiring changes to our business, strategies or operations. Changes in law, enforcement priorities, policy, and other actions that materially adversely affect our business may be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures or ensure timely compliance. These changes could also expose us to significant fines, government investigations, litigation and reputational harm, all of which could be costly, result in distractions for management, adversely impact our operational results, and could alter our ability to execute on our strategic plans. All of these impacts could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.",
