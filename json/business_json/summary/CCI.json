  "item1_summary": " The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business . Such transactions or activities could be complex, costly and time-consuming, or cause disruptions, increase risk to or otherwise negatively impact our business. Such transactions and activities may disrupt our business relationships with our tenants and landlords, depending on the nature of or counterparty to such transactions .\n Fiber segment represented 33% and 34% of our site rental revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively . Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks . Fiber operations have certain risks that are similar to our Towers operations, but they also have certain operational risks (including the scalability of processes)\n Fiber operations expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our Towers business as a result of numerous factors, including new technologies that could enable tenants to realize the same benefits with less utilization of our fiber . The rate at which tenants adopt or prioritize small cells and fiber solutions has been lower or slower than we anticipated, and may continue to be lower .\n There may be risks and challenges associated with small cells and fiber solutions being comparatively new and emerging technologies that are continuing to evolve . Failure to complete the planned sale of the Fiber Business to Zayo and EQT could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price .\n Construction projects and related contracts can be long-term, complex in nature, dangerous, costly and challenging to execute . The quality of our performance on such construction projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage (1) the associated tenant relationship and (2) the project itself . In connection with our construction projects, we generally bear the risk of cost over-runs, labor availability and productivity .\n Investments in newly constructed communications infrastructure may result in lower initial returns compared to returns on existing communications infrastructure or us not being able to realize future tenant additions at anticipated levels . New technologies and spectrum that may promote network sharing, joint development, backhaul and fronthaul efficiency or resale agreements by our tenants may reduce the need for our communications infrastructure .\n If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the rights to land under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be affected . New technologies that enhance the range, efficiency and capacity of communication equipment could reduce demand for our infrastructure .\n 54% of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile . We have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms . If we are unable to retain rights to the property on which our communications infrastructure is located, our business may be adversely affected .\n 32% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases or other agreements with T-Mobile . We have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from AT&T at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $4.2 billion .\n For our small cells and fiber, we must maintain rights-of-way, franchise, pole attachment, conduit use, fiber use and other agreements to operate our assets . We may not always have the ability to maintain these agreements or obtain future agreements to construct, maintain and operate our fiber assets . Access to rights of-way may depend on our CLEC status .\n Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results . The operating results of our services business for any particular period may experience significant fluctuations given its non-recurring nature and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer-term results for this activity . During both 2023 and 2024, due primarily to our discontinuation of installation services as a Towers product offering, services and other revenues decreased by 36% and 53%, respectively, when compared to years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 .\n As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts . We face competition for site rental tenants and associated contractual rates from various sources, including (1) other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators, (2) tenants who elect to self-perform .\n There can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies, which may drive demand for our communications infrastructure, will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected . Demand or tenant adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons . Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services and wireless technologies may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies .\n Cybersecurity breaches or other information technology disruptions could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation . Despite existing security measures, certain of our information technology and communications infrastructure may be subject to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to unauthorized access, computer viruses, ransomware or other malicious software . We currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters .\n If an actual or perceived breach of our cybersecurity or information technology, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose tenants . The perpetrators of cyber-attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons, such as cyber terrorists or nation-state actors . We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats .\n We cannot predict with certainty the rate at which climate change is occurring or the potential direct or indirect impacts of climate change to our operations . We do not maintain, and do not expect to maintain, insurance policies that provide adequate coverage in the event that our actions (or those actions of those acting on our behalf) contribute to a natural disaster .\n ESG goals may be difficult to implement, may lead to increased scrutiny by policymakers and stakeholders . Applicable laws, regulations and policies in some cases may conflict with those in other countries . Failure to comply with any legislation, regulation or policy could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, reputual harm or changes .\n Failure to attract, recruit and retain qualified and experienced employees could adversely affect our business, operations and costs . We have encountered a competitive labor market for experienced talent in our industry due to macroeconomic conditions . The pendency of the sale of our Fiber Business to Zayo and EQT may have an adverse effect on our business .\n Changes to management, including turnover of our top executives, could have an adverse effect on our business . Any of the foregoing could result in significant disruptions to our operations and impact our ability to execute on our strategy and pursue strategic initiatives . We have increased our dependency on remaining members of our executive management team to facilitate a smooth transition in leadership rol\n Actions that we are taking, or have completed, to restructure our business may not be as effective as anticipated . Our executive officers are at-will employees; as such, their employment with us could terminate at any time . If we are unable to mitigate these or other similar risks, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected .\n We have made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under the Restructuring Plans, which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation and closure of office space . These assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors . We may incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur .\n Actions of activist stockholders could impact the pursuit of our business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or stock price . If we experience any of these adverse consequences, the Restructuring Plans may not achieve or sustain their intended benefits, or the benefits, even if achieved, may not be adequate to meet our long-term profitability and operational expectations .\n The board of directors could change its recommendation and cease soliciting proxies in favor of Messrs. Genrich or Patel if it first made a determination that its fiduciary duties required it to do so . The Cooperation Agreement, as amended, remains in effect . The sale of our Fiber Business to Zayo and EQT may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position .\n The pendency of the sale of our Fiber Business to Zayo and EQT may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position . The pending sale of the Fiber Business may have a negative effect on the company's operating results if our customers delay, defer, or cancel work with us pending the sale .\n iber Transaction is subject to additional risks in connection with the pendency of the proposed Strategic Fiber Transaction . The parties with which we do business may be uncertain as to the effects the transaction may have on them, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us . The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in the consummation of the transaction .\n Failure to complete the planned sale of the Fiber Business to Zayo and EQT could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and stock price . Failure to successfully complete the sale could divert management’s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us .\n The failure to complete the planned sale of the Fiber Business to Zayo and EQT could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and stock price . The Strategic Fiber Transaction, which is expected to close in the first half of 2026, is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, and there is no assurance that all of the various conditions will be satisfied .\n If the Strategic Fiber Transaction does not close, we may suffer consequences that could adversely affect our ongoing and future business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and stock price . We have incurred significant costs, including professional services fees and other transaction costs, in connection with the proposed transaction that we would be unable to recover, and devoted substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and employees .\n As a result of our substantial indebtedness, we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions . We may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund discretionary investments or other corporate requirements . We are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal or interest on our debt, thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects .\n As of March 12, 2025, approximately 9% of our outstanding indebtedness consisted of variable interest rates . The Federal Reserve has started to loosen its monetary policy by lowering the federal funds rate . Any prolonged period of elevated interest rates or further increases to interest rates on such debt could continue to adversely impact our financial results and our ability to meet our dividend growth targets .\n If limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT . If our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt, the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt, in which case we could lose the communications infrastructure and the associated revenues .\n There can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt, or (3) at all . Economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of volatility, uncertainty, or weakness .\n If we are unable to repay or refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to . obtain enough capital to fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends .

There may be uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision . Domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring communications infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination .\n We cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws, will not adversely affect our business . Failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil or criminal penalties, require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions . We are updating our capital allocation framework to focus more on free cash flow generation and financial flexibility .\n To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we are generally required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available NOLs) to our stockholders . Future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations .\n Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, thereby increasing our tax obligations and reducing our available cash .
