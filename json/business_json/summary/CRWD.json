  "item1_summary": " The market price of our Class A common stock, or “common stock,” could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment . The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below, or of additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects .\n If organizations do not adopt cloud-based SaaS-delivered endpoint security solutions, our ability to grow our business and results of operations may be adversely affected . If our or our service providers’ internal networks, systems, or data are or are perceived to have been compromised, our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively affected .\n CrowdStrike: We are required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security . We rely on our key technical, sales and management personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business .\n The July 19 Incident has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, sales, customer and partner relations, reputation, results of operations and financial condition . Future acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, disrupt business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business .\n The July 19 Incident has harmed, and is expected to continue to harm, our business, sales, customer and partner relations, and our reputation . Certain of our competitors have aggressively approached our current and prospective customers and partners to attempt to capitalize on the incident . We cannot guarantee that our products do not have or will not have defects, errors, or vulnerabilities . We are investing in enhancements to software resiliency, testing and customer controls .\n We are party to a number of legal proceedings relating to the July 19 Incident, such as lawsuits filed by or on behalf of third parties . Government authorities may seek to impose undertakings, injunctive relief, consent decrees or other penalties . These factors may result in harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition . Some customers and other third parties claiming to have been impacted by the incident have asserted claims against us .\n We expect our insurance coverage will not cover all costs, claims and liabilities actually incurred . We cannot be certain that our insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim . We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we do not manage our future growth, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected .\n We have a history of losses, and while we have achieved profitability in certain periods, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future . We have incurred net losses each year prior to fiscal 2024, and we cannot assure you when or whether we will reach sustained profitability . As of January 31, 2025, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.1 billion .\n If organizations do not adopt cloud-based SaaS-delivered endpoint security solutions, our ability to grow our business and results of operations may be adversely affected . Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our solutions . Any failure to increase our revenue as we invest in our business or to manage our costs could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow .\n Falcon does not know if trend in adoption of cloud-based SaaS-delivered endpoint security solutions will continue in the future . Falcon: \"If we are unable to successfully enhance our existing products and services and introduce new products, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed. ditions or otherwise, it could result in early terminations, reduced customer retention rates, or decreased revenue\"\n Success depends on timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancement or new solution . Failure to effectively deliver, integrate, and manage perceptions with respect to enhancements and new solutions could erode our competitive position, significantly impair our revenue growth, and negatively impact our operating results . If we are unable to attract new customers, our future results of operations could be harmed .\n Any deterioration in general economic conditions, including as a result of the geopolitical environment, may cause customers to delay or cut their overall security and IT operations spending . Economic weakness may result in decreased revenue, reduced sales, an increase in multi-phase subscription start dates, shorter terms for customer subscriptions, lengthened sales cycles, increased churn, lower demand for our products .\n Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscription for our Falcon platform after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is generally one to three years . Customers that previously signed multi-year subscription contracts may renew for shorter contract subscription lengths, and customers may cease using certain cloud modules altogether . Our customer retention, renewals and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our products and services .\n If our efforts to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing customers are not successful, our financial condition may suffer . Longer sales cycles may result in shorter subscription periods, fewer endpoints or smaller contract values . We have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, longer sales cycles in connection with the July 19 Incident .\n The failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a lengthy sales process could adversely affect our business and results of operations . Security solution purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unanticipated administrative, processing and other delays . We expect to continue to face intense competition from current competitors, as well as from new entrants into the market . Our ability to compete effectively depends upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control .\n Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketin capabilities, including performance and reliability, of our Falcon platform, including cloud modules, services, and features compared to those of their competitors . Our competitors include the following by general category: antivirus product providers who offer a broad range of approaches and solutions including traditional signature-based anti-virus protection .\n Our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and services offerings as well as routes to market . They may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of services than we can . Some of our competitors have recently made acquisitions of businesses or have established cooperative relationships that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than were previously offered .\n If our competitors include functionality that is, or is perceived to be, equivalent to or better than ours in legacy products that are already accepted as necessary components of an organization’s IT security architecture, we may have difficulty increasing the market penetration of our solutions . If we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive pricing, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected .\n Real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our Falcon platform and cloud modules could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations . We cannot assure you that our products will detect all cyberattacks, especially in light of the rapidly changing security threat landscape that our solution seeks to address .\n There is a risk that an advanced attack could emerge that our cloud native security platform is unable to detect or prevent . Any defects, errors or vulnerabilities in third-party technology or solutions we rely on could result in disruptions to our operations . Additionally, our Falcon platform may falsely indicate a cyberattack or threat that does not actually exist, which may lessen customers’ trust in our solutions .\n No security solution, including our Falcon platform, can address all possible security threats . If a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another next-generation or cloud-based security system, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in cloud solutions generally . misconfiguration or malfunction of our platform or third-party platforms, could result in personally-identifiable information and other customer data being accessible such as to attackers or to other customers .\n As a cybersecurity provider, CrowdStrike has been, and expect to continue to be, a target of cyberattacks . Real or perceived security breaches of our customers’ networks could cause disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences . Such efforts may also intensify as geopolitical tensions increase, such as the July 19 Incident .\n A successful attack or other incident that results in an interruption of service could have a significant negative effect on our operations, reputation, financial resources, and the value of our intellectual property . Organizations are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their supply chain, networks, systems, and endpoints, and techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to networks .\n We may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate measures to prevent an intrusion into our networks, which could result in unauthorized access to customer data, intellectual property including access to our source code . The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible o .\n We rely on third-party data centers, such as Amazon Web Services, to host and operate our Falcon platform . We have experienced interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints .\n Cybersecurity risk includes cyberattacks, acts of war or terrorism, human error or interference (including by disgruntled employees, former employees or contractors) and other catastrophic events . Interruptions or failures in our service delivery could result in a cyberattack or other security threat to us or to one of our customers . The adverse effects of any service interruptions on our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition may be disproportionately heightened .\n We have experienced, and may in the future experience, service interruptions and other performance problems due to a variety of factors . The occurrence of any of these factors, or if we are unable to rapidly and cost-effectively fix such errors, could damage our reputation, negatively affect our relationship with our customers or otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition .\n There is significant competition for personnel with skills and technical knowledge that we require across our technology, cyber, sales, professional services, and administrative support functions . We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications . Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have .\n Many of our employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of equity awards . This may make it more difficult for us to retain and motivate these employees . Failure to successfully expand and train our direct sales force could affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel . We have expanded our capabilities significantly in recent periods and expect to continue to add additional capabilities .\n Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals . New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity, and this delay is accentuated by our long sales cycles . A large percentage of our sales force is new to our company and may be less effective than our more seasoned sales personnel .\n Any increase or decline in new sales or renewals in any one period will not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that period . Any such change, however, would affect our revenue in future periods . Subsequent to July 19 Incident, customer commitment packages introduced that extend subscription periods will lengthen the applicable term over which we recognize revenue .\n Ons will continue to vary as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including: economic difficulties confronting our customers, which may impact the number of modules or endpoint deployments they are willing or able to purchase . The timing and length of our sales cycles and the timing of sales cycles will vary .\n The timing of operating costs (including new hires), tightening of labor markets and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business . The company also experience seasonality in its operating margin, typically with a lower margin in the first half of our fiscal year . Any of the above factors, individually or in the aggregate, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial results of operations from period to period .\n If we fail to meet expectations for these or other reasons, our stock price could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits . The successful promotion of our CrowdStrike and Falcon brands depends on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop additional cloud modules and features for our Falcon platform .\n If these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors’ products, our brand may be adversely affected . Our solutions may fail to detect or prevent threats in any particular test for a number of reasons that may be related to the efficacy of our solutions in real world environments . The performance of our channel partners and technology alliance partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with these partners .\n The vast majority of sales of our Falcon platform flow through our channel partners, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future . Failure to effectively manage our existing sales channels could harm our business, financial position and results of operations . The loss of a substantial number of our channel . partners or the failure to recruit additional partners could adversely affect our results .\n We derived approximately 32, 32%, 32%, and 30% of our total revenue from our international customers for fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2023 . We expect that our international activities will continue to grow in the future, as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets . These international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources and are subject to substantial risks .\n A strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the cost of our solutions to our solutions . Foreign exchange controls or tax regulations that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States . The uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; . Political and economic instability in some . countries; unexpected costs for the localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements .\n An increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the United States; is denominated in foreign currencies, such as the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen . If we become more exposed to currency fluctuations and are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be adversely affected .\n Sales to governmental agencies can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that such efforts will generate a sale . There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain security clearances to perform on classified contracts for government agencies, such as those with classified clearances .\n Government attitudes towards us as a company, our platform or the capabilities that we offer as a viable software solution may change, and reduce interest in our products and services as acceptable solutions . The Falcon platform is designed to provide software to government agencies . The company's Falcon platform was designed to meet demand for government contracts .\n The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our solutions in the future . We may not timely and cost-effectively scale and adapt our existing technology to meet our customers’ performance and other requirements . As our business grows, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology infrastructure . It takes a significant amount of time to plan, develop and test improvements to our technologies and infrastructure .\n If we are unable to adapt to product or policy changes in ecosystems, demand for and availability of our products or services could decline . If our cloud-based server costs were to increase, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected . Ongoing improvements to cloud infrastructure may be more expensive than we anticipate, and may not yield expected savings in operating costs .\n Our ability to maintain customer satisfaction depends in part on the quality of our customer support . Failure to maintain high-quality customer support could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition . We may not be able to maintain or achieve cost savings from our investments, which could harm our financial results . We expect that the combination of our existing cash and cash . and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures .\n Our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products or services could reduce our ability to compete . As we grow, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture as we grow . Failure to preserve our culture could harm our future success, including the ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and innovate .\n We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components of the equipment we use to operate our cloud platform . We generally purchase these components on a purchase order basis, and do not have long-term contracts guaranteeing supply . Supply chain disruptions could delay our ability to expand or increase the capacity of our global data center network, replace defective equipment in our existing data centers .\n We are exposed to the credit risks of certain of our customers and end-users, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations . The success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights . There can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor and mitigate these credit risks will be effective .\n We have filed for patents in the United States and in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, but such protections may not be available in all countries in which we operate . Many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties . Many countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors .\n Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive . The inability to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition . A number of companies in our industry hold a large number of patents and also protect their copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights .\n As the number of products and competitors in the security and IT operations market increases and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase . Many of our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have .\n If we are prevented from using certain technology or intellectual property, we may be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology . Failure to obtain a license could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected . We may be unable to continue to offer our affected products, subscriptions or services, while developing such technology .\n We cannot be certain that our licensors do not or will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties . We may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products, providing certain subscriptions or performing certain services . Any of these events could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations .\n We are required to comply with stringent, complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards relating to data privacy and security . Ensuring compliance with such requirements may increase operating costs, impact our data processing practices and policies and the development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency, any of which could adversely affect our business and operations .\n At the state level, we are subject to laws and regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act . The CCPA broadly defines personal information and gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections . The U.S. Congress also has considered, is currently considering, and may in the future consider, various proposals for comprehensive federal data privacy and security legislation .\n The U.K. government has announced plans and introduced legislative proposals to chart its own path on data protection and reform its relevant laws . Failure to comply with the GDPR can result in significant fines and other liability, including fines of up to EUR 20 million (or GBP 17.5 million under the . GDPR) or four percent of annual global revenue, whichever is greater .\n The efficacy and longevity of these mechanisms remains uncertain . The EU has also proposed legislation that would regulate non-personal data and establish new cybersecurity standards, and other countries, including the U.K., may similarly do so in the future . If we are otherwise unable to transfer data, including personal data, between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could adversely affect our financial results .\n We strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, rules regulations and industry standards . We cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and security . Procedures and controls may not be effective in ensuring compliance or preventing unauthorized transfers of personal data .\n Any failure or perceived failure by us or any third parties with which we do business to comply with privacy policies, data privacy or security laws, rules, regulations, standards, certifications or contractual obligations may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices . SEC scrutiny from the SEC increases the risk of investigations into cybersecurity practices, and related disclosures, of companies within its jurisdiction .\n Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties . Noncompliance could also cause us to lose customers or negatively impact our ability to contract with customers, including those in the public sector . In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the United States . Increased scrutiny may also lead to new laws or regulations that target topics such as AI, critical infrastructure software resiliency and concentration risk .\n Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition . Response to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources . Failure by us, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties could lead to claims for damages, penalties, termination of contracts, loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property .\n Our products, services and business activities, including our collection of information about cyber threats, are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws . Changes in these laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products or services into international markets . Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-con .\n We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws in the United States and other countries in which we conduct activities . Non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation . As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase .\n Noncompliance with the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to investigations, whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, and other enforcement actions within the U.S. and internationally . Failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products and subscriptions .\n Many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business . The wide availability of source code used in our solutions could expose us to security vulnerabilities . The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in ways that could impose unanticipated conditions .\n From time to time, we may face claims from third parties asserting ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software . These claims could result in litigation. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition .\n We use AI, which could expose us to liability or adversely affect our business . We incorporate novel uses of AI technologies, including generative AI, into our products and operations . We face significant competition from other companies who may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more successfully than us . AI has been known to produce a false or “hallucinatory” interferences or output .\n The technologies underlying AI and its uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including intellectual property, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, consumer protection, competition, and equal opportunity laws . The EU’s AI Act was published in the Official Journal of the EU on July 12, 2024 and entered into force on August 1, 2024 . In 2024, California enacted a range of laws regulating the use and development of AI .\n It is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks that may arise relating to the use of AI technology . We may not be able to anticipate how to respond to or comply with these rapidly evolving frameworks, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions .\n We may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits for future subscriptions, and, in certain cases, refunds . To date, there has not been a material failure to meet our service level commitments, and we do not currently have any material liabilities accrued on our balance sheets for such commitments . We are regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations and other proceedings .\n It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines and penalties . These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring a change in our business practices . We cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business .\n The sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims . We have received, and may continue to receive, claims in connection with the July 19 Incident . If our customers or other third parties we do business with make intellectual property rights or other indemnification claims against us, we will incur significant legal expenses . We may also have to seek a license for the technology .\n Large indemnity obligations, whether for intellectual property or other claims, could harm our business . We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and/or cause us to alter our products and services . Any such misuse of our Falcon platform could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation .\n The market price of our common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this ‘Risk Factors’ Many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance . Failure or refusal of our insurance providers to provide the expected insurance benefits to us after we have paid the warranty claims would cause us to incur significant expense .\n The company's  significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments are significant contracts . The company has a history of litigation, litigation and other legal developments . The stock market has fluctuated in valuations of the company and other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular . In addition, the company’s stock market value has declined in recent years .\n The market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies . We are currently party to securities litigation asserted against us arising out of the July 19 Incident . Any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business . As of February 28, 2025, we had 247,873,415 shares of common stock outstanding .\n The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that analysts publish about us or our business . We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports . If any of the analysts who cover us issues an inaccurate or unfavorable opinion, our stock price would likely decline .\n Certain provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or current management . Our ability to pay dividends is limited by restrictions on our ability to make distributions under the terms of our credit facility . Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur .\n The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States, will be the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders . These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time .\n Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf . However, this exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by Exchange Act . Federal district courts of the U.S. will be the only forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under Securities Act .\n Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements . We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations . The ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition .\n Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on, among other things, the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time . Failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness . In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial problems .\n Our revolving facility and indenture that governs our Senior Notes contain terms which restrict our current and future operations . If we breach the covenants under our debt instruments, we would be in default under such instruments . The holders of such indebtedness could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation .\n These restrictive covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations . We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future . If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected .\n A breach of the covenants under our revolving facility or the indenture that governs our Senior Notes could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness . Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies .\n The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting . Compliance has increased, and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly . Weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future, and we may uncover new deficiencies .\n Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to report effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting . Failure to maintain effective controls could have a negative effect on the company's stock price . Future acquisitions could be difficult to identify and integrate, disrupt our business, financial condition, and adversely affect our business .\n We may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all . We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our common stock . The sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any  such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders .\n Additional risks include the need to address issues related to the acquisition of the company's assets . The company's failure to address these risks could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and investments, and harm our business generally . We need to improve our ability to deal with these issues and manage our own finances .\n The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities . The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions . Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes .\n In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected, among other things, by (i) changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations . We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value added taxes against us .\n Under Pillar Two, the Inclusive Framework has agreed on a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for companies with revenue above €750 million . The timetable for implementation has since been extended to 2024 and, with respect to certain components of the plan, to 2025 . Future tax reform resulting from these developments could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities .\n As of January 31, 2025, we had U.S federal and California research and development credit carryforwards of $165.1 million and $39.6 million . The federal net operating losses are carried forward indefinitely, and California net operating loss carryforters begin to expire in fiscal 2034 through fiscal 2045 .\n Tax authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations . erating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us .\n The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources . Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition; allowance for credit losses; valuation of common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants .\n Falcon Funds, we invest in early to late stage private companies, and we may not realize a return on our equity investments . Many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services, or technologies may be slow to develop or never materialize . Capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies in which we have invested could deteriorate .\n There is an increasing focus from certain stakeholders concerning ESG matters, both in the U.S. and abroad . This could be difficult to achieve, or be perceived to fail, these goals, or commitments to them . It could also challenge the accuracy, or completeness of these goals or commitments, in the future .\n Our business is subject to the risks of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, natural events such as earthquakes, fire, floods, and the outbreak of diseases . Climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters . Damage to our reputation or reduced demand for our products may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations .\n In the event of a major disruption caused by a catastrophic event, such as a natural disaster, or man-made problem, CrowdStrike may be unable to continue its operations . Computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts, and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry . Our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses we may incur .\n CrowdStrike provides framework for identifying, monitoring, evaluating, and responding to cybersecurity threats and incidents . CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity team is responsible for assessing our cybersecurity risk management program and our incident response plan . We review or update our cybersecurity policies, standards and procedures annually, or more frequently as needed, to account for changes in the threat landscape .\n In fiscal 2025, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats or incidents that have materially affected our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition . However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats .
