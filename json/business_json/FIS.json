We unlock financial technology to the world across the money lifecycle underpinning the world's financial systems. Our people are dedicated to advancing the way the world pays, banks and invests, by helping our clients to confidently run, grow and protect their businesses. Our expertise comes from decades of experience helping financial institutions and businesses of all sizes adapt to meet the needs of their customers by harnessing where reliability meets innovation in financial technology. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, FIS is a member of the Fortune 500® and the Standard & Poor’s 500® Index. FIS is incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia as Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., and our stock is traded under the trading symbol \"FIS\" on the New York Stock Exchange.\nGrowth and Strategy Objectives\nOur growth has been driven by a number of factors, including growth of our customers' businesses, our internal development of new solutions that enhance our client offerings, and our sales and marketing efforts to expand our customer base and addressable markets. Acquisitions have also contributed additional solutions that complement or enhance our offerings, diversify our client base, expand our geographic coverage, and provide entry into new and attractive adjacent markets that align with our strategic objectives. We continue to strategically allocate resources to both internal and external growth initiatives to enhance the long-term value of our business. \nWorldpay Sale Summary\nOn January 31, 2024, we completed the sale (the \"Worldpay Sale\") of a 55% equity interest in our Worldpay Merchant Solutions business to private equity funds managed by GTCR, LLC (such funds, the \"Buyer\"). FIS retained a non-controlling 45% equity interest in a new standalone joint venture, Worldpay Holdco, LLC (\"Worldpay\"), following the closing of the Worldpay Sale. Worldpay continues to provide merchant acquiring and related services to businesses of all sizes and across any industry globally, enabling them to accept, authorize and settle electronic payment transactions. In connection with the Worldpay Sale, FIS and Worldpay entered into commercial agreements, preserving a key value proposition for clients of both businesses and reducing potential dis-synergies. FIS and Worldpay also entered into additional agreements as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe our competitive strengths include the following:\n•\nBrand. \nFIS is a highly respected brand known globally for innovation and thought leadership in the financial services sector. \n•\nExtensive Domain Expertise and Portfolio Breadth. \nFIS' significant expertise in the markets and domains we serve enables us to deliver a broad range of innovative software applications and flexible service offerings, ranging from managed processing arrangements, either at the client site or hosted at an FIS data center or in our private cloud, to traditional license and maintenance arrangements. Our expansive solution set allows us to bundle tailored or integrated services to compete effectively. \n•\nExcellent and Long-term Relationships with Clients. \nA significant percentage of our business relates to solutions provided under multi-year, recurring contracts. The nature of these relationships allows us to develop close partnerships with our clients, resulting in high client retention rates. As the breadth of FIS' service offerings has \n2\nTable of \nContents\nexpanded, we have found that our deep and broad access within our clients' organizations presents greater opportunities for cross-selling and up-selling solutions to our clients. \n•\nModern and Cloud-based Technologies.\n FIS leverages the modern architectures of our software applications and our ability to integrate many of our solutions with the solutions of others to provide customized solutions that respond to individualized client needs. We have made significant investment in modernizing our platforms and solutions and have moved substantially all of our server compute into our private cloud located in our strategic data centers, supplemented by public clouds in certain regions, to increase speed of delivery to clients and increase solution availability to industry-best levels. \n•\nGlobal\n \nDistribution and Scale. \nWe are a global leader in many of the markets we serve, supported by a large, knowledgeable talent pool of employees around the world. Our worldwide presence and global scale enable us to leverage our array of solution offerings, client relationships, and modern infrastructure to drive revenue growth and operating efficiency.\nStrategy\nOur mission is to deliver superior solutions to our clients and to expand our client base to generate sustained revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders. Our strategy to achieve this goal is built on the following pillars:\n•\nBuild, Buy, or Partner to Add Solutions to Win New Clients and Cross-sell to Existing Clients. \nWe continue to invest in our solution portfolio through internal software development, as well as through acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships that complement and extend our existing solutions and capabilities, providing us with additional solutions to cross-sell to current clients and to capture the interest of new clients. By investing in solution innovation, we continue to expand our value proposition to our clients and prospects.\n•\nSupport Our Clients Through Innovation. \nChanging market dynamics, particularly in the areas of digital delivery, information security and regulation, are transforming the way our clients operate, which is driving incremental demand for our integrated solutions built around our intellectual property. As clients and prospects evaluate technology, business process changes and vendor risks, our depth of service capabilities enables us to become involved earlier in their planning and design process and assist them as they manage these changes.\n•\nDrive Efficiency and Scalability.\n We strive to improve the efficiency of our operations through investments in new technologies, processes and infrastructure modernization. We also leverage a one-to-many operating model to drive high incremental margins on revenue growth, while also providing cost-effective solutions for our clients.\n•\nExpand Distribution.\n Through our global sales force and strategic commercial partnerships, we drive growth through client additions and the expansion of existing client relationships in support of our clients' growth ambitions. Our clients range from large banks, financial institutions and other enterprises, including multi-national clients, to community or regional financial institutions and other businesses.\n•\nAllocate Our Capital and Resources Strategically. \nAs we make decisions with respect to building, buying or partnering to drive innovation in support of our clients, we prioritize the allocation of capital and other resources to the opportunities providing the highest client benefit and growth potential. We also continually review our portfolio of assets and businesses to assess their fit with our strategy and will, from time to time, decide to wind down or divest businesses or assets to redeploy capital to our areas of strategic focus. We believe that keeping our team and our capital strategically focused benefits our existing clients and our ability to win new clients. At the same time, to the extent our businesses generate excess cash, we strategically use it to repurchase shares, repay debt, pay dividends or for other corporate purposes.\nSegment Information\nFIS reports its financial performance based on the following segments: Banking Solutions (\"Banking\"), Capital Market Solutions (\"Capital Markets\") and Corporate and Other. \nThe Worldpay Merchant Solutions business included the former Merchant Solutions segment in addition to a business previously included in the Corporate and Other segment. The results of the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business have been recast as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, the Company no longer reports the Merchant Solutions \n3\nTable of \nContents\nsegment. The assets and liabilities of the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business disposal group are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets, and the operating results have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As such, the related results have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results. See Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Worldpay Merchant Solutions disposal group and its discontinued operations. FIS' share of the net income of Worldpay is reported as equity method investment earnings (loss).\nAs a result of our ongoing portfolio assessments, the Company reclassified certain businesses from Capital Markets to Banking and to Corporate and Other during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and reclassified certain non-strategic operations from Banking to Corporate and Other during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The Company recast all prior-period segment information presented to reflect these reclassifications. See \"Segment Information\" below for additional discussion of our solutions and customers. See also Notes 6 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our segment revenue.\nOur consolidated results generally do not reflect pronounced seasonality. However, quarterly revenue and margins for each segment may vary based on the timing of recognition of certain non-recurring revenue, including software licenses and termination fees.\nFor information about current trends in market demand, see \"Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - \nBusiness Trends and Conditions\n.\n\"\nRevenue by Segment\nThe table below summarizes our revenue by reporting segment (in millions):\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nBanking Solutions (1)\n$\n6,892 \n$\n6,743 \n$\n6,625 \nCapital Market Solutions\n2,979 \n2,766 \n2,631 \nCorporate and Other\n256 \n322 \n464 \nTotal Consolidated Revenue\n$\n10,127 \n$\n9,831 \n$\n9,720 \n(1)\nDuring 2024, the Company revised its previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the annual periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, to correct certain immaterial misstatements. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our revision of prior-period consolidated financial statements.\nBanking Solutions (\"Banking\")\nThe Banking segment is focused on serving financial institutions with core processing software, transaction processing software and complementary applications and services, many of which interact directly with core processing software. We sell these solutions on either a bundled or stand-alone basis. Clients in this segment include global financial institutions, U.S. regional and community banks, credit unions and commercial lenders, as well as government institutions and other commercial organizations. We provide our clients integrated solutions characterized by multi-year processing contracts that generate recurring revenue. The predictable nature of cash flows generated from the Banking segment provides opportunities for further investments in innovation, integration, information and security, and compliance in a cost-effective manner.\nOur solutions in this segment include the following:\n•\nCore Processing and Ancillary Applications.\n Our core processing software applications, including deposit and lending, customer management and other central management systems, are designed to run banking processes for our financial institution clients. Clients use these applications to maintain the primary records of their customer accounts. Our diverse selection of market-focused core processing software applications enables FIS to compete effectively in a wide range of markets. We continue to invest in our core modernization efforts to further differentiate our offerings for the long term. We also offer a number of solutions that are ancillary to the primary applications listed above, including branch automation, back-office support systems and compliance support.\n•\nDigital, including Mobile and Online.\n Our comprehensive suite of retail and commercial applications enables financial institutions to streamline and integrate customer-facing operations with back-office processes, thereby improving customer experience across channels (e.g., branch, internet, mobile, ATM, and call centers). FIS' focus on real-time consumer access has driven significant market innovation in multi-channel, API-enabled embedded and multi-hosted solutions, underpinned by a strategy that provides tight integration and a seamless customer experience. \nOur innovative digital banking capabilities are now available to financial institutions with continually expanding \n4\nTable of \nContents\nfunctionality. Our digital offerings are\n integrated with core banking platforms offered by FIS and are also offered to customers of non-FIS core systems.\n•\nFraud, Risk Management and Compliance.\n Our decision solutions offer a spectrum of options that cover the account lifecycle from helping to identify qualified account applicants to managing existing customer accounts and fraud. Our applications enable Know Your Customer, new account decisioning and opening, account and transaction management, fraud management and collections. Our risk management solutions use our proprietary risk management models and data sources to assist in detecting fraud and assessing the risk of opening a new account. Our systems use a combination of advanced authentication procedures, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence modeling and proprietary and shared databases to assess and detect fraud risk for deposit, card and other transactions for financial institutions.\n•\nCard and Retail Payments.\n Our card and retail payment technology solutions allow clients to issue VISA\n®\n, MasterCard\n®\n or other payment network-branded credit and debit cards or other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts. Card-based volumes continue to increase, driven by both the number of transactions per month and the value of those transactions. We offer EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) integrated circuit cards, often referred to as chip cards, as well as a variety of stored-value card types and loyalty programs, including our Premium Payback service that allows our financial institutions' customers to use loyalty points at a variety of merchant point-of-sale systems. Our integrated solutions range from card production and activation to processing to an extensive range of fraud management solutions and value-added loyalty programs designed to increase card usage and fee-based revenue for financial institutions and merchants. The majority of our programs are full service, including most of the operations and support necessary for an issuer to operate a credit card program. We do not make credit decisions for our card issuing clients. We are also a leading provider of prepaid card solutions, which include digital cards, gift cards and reloadable cards, with end-to-end solutions for the development, processing and administration of stored-value programs, including government benefit programs. Our closed-loop gift card solutions and loyalty programs provide merchants compelling solutions to drive consumer loyalty.\n•\nElectronic Funds Transfer and Network.\n Our electronic funds transfer and debit card processing businesses offer settlement and card management solutions for financial institution card issuers. We offer a modern, core-agnostic payment hub with real-time fraud monitoring across payment rails. We own and operate several U.S. domestic debit, prepaid, ATM and credit networks that carry transactions for a variety of transaction modes. Our networks connect millions of cards and point-of-sale locations nationwide, providing consumers with secure, real-time access to their money. Also through our networks, clients such as financial institutions, retailers and independent ATM operators can capitalize on the efficiency, consumer convenience and security of electronic real-time payments, real-time account-to-account transfers, and strategic alliances, such as surcharge-free ATM network arrangements.\n•\nWealth and Retirement.\n We provide wealth and retirement solutions that help banks, trust companies, brokerage firms, insurance firms, retirement plan professionals, benefit administrators and independent advisors acquire, service and grow their client relationships. We provide solutions for client acquisition, transaction management, trust accounting and recordkeeping that can be deployed stand-alone, as part of an integrated wealth or retirement platform, or on an outsourced basis.\n•\nItem Processing and Output Solutions.\n Our item processing solutions furnish financial institutions with the technology needed to capture data from checks, transaction tickets and other items; image and sort items; process exceptions through keying; and perform balancing, archiving and the production of statements. Our item processing services are performed at one of our multiple item processing centers located throughout the U.S. or on-site at client locations. Our extensive solutions include distributed (i.e., non-centralized) data capture, mobile deposit capture, check and remittance processing, fraud detection, and document and report management. Clients encompass banks and corporations of all sizes, from de novo banks to the largest financial institutions and corporations. We offer a number of output solutions that are ancillary to the primary solutions we provide, including print and mail capabilities, document composition software and solutions, and card personalization fulfillment solutions. Our print and mail solutions offer complete computer output solutions for the creation, management and delivery of print and fulfillment needs. We provide our card personalization fulfillment solutions for branded credit cards and branded and non-branded debit and prepaid cards.\n5\nTable of \nContents\nCapital Market Solutions (\"Capital Markets\")\nThe Capital Markets segment is focused on serving global financial services clients and corporations with a broad array of buy- and sell-side, treasury, risk management and lending solutions. Clients in this segment include asset managers, private equity firms, sell-side securities brokerage and trading firms, insurers, asset and auto financiers and other commercial organizations. Our solutions include a variety of mission-critical buy- and sell-side applications for recordkeeping, data and analytics, trading and financing, as well as corporate treasury and risk management applications. Capital Markets clients purchase our solutions in various ways including licensing and managing technology \"in-house,\" using consulting and third-party service providers, as well as procuring fully outsourced end-to-end solutions. Our long-established relationships with many of these financial and commercial institutions generate significant recurring revenue. We have made, and continue to make, investments in modern platforms, advanced technologies, open APIs, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and regulatory technology to support our Capital Markets clients.\nOur solutions in this segment include the following:\n•\nTrading and Asset Services. \nWe offer solutions that support our customers across the buy and sell sides of the capital markets industry, assisting them to control their front, middle and back office operations through integrated ecosystems. Our solutions support institutional investors, managers, broker-dealers, asset servicers and transfer agents across all asset classes including private equity, hedge, credit, and traditional. Our trading applications focus on advanced trade life-cycle management, including market making and risk management, cleared derivatives processing, securities processing and securities finance, tax processing, and regulatory compliance, including anti-money laundering (AML) and trade surveillance. Our Asset Servicing solutions support every stage of the investment process, from research and portfolio management to order and position management, valuation, risk management, corporate actions, reconciliation, investment accounting, investor accounting, transfer agency and client reporting. Our solutions improve both investment decision making and operational efficiency, while managing risk and increasing transparency across the industry.\n•\nLending\n. Our lending solutions offer full life-cycle commercial lending functionality from loan origination, commercial credit assessment and customer risk rating to loan servicing and data analytics. We also offer the leveraged and syndicated loan markets solutions that manage amendments, secondary market trading, deal management and bookrunning. In the asset finance space, we offer a single, end-to-end leasing platform that helps auto and equipment finance companies manage the entire financing process, supporting origination and pricing, credit decisioning, contract management, servicing and collections.\n•\nTreasury and Risk. \nOur treasury solutions help chief financial officers and treasurers manage working capital by reducing risk and improving communication and response time between a company's buyers, suppliers, banks, and other stakeholders. Our end-to-end financial management framework helps bring together receivables, treasury, and payments for a single view of cash and risk, which helps our clients optimize business processes for enhanced liquidity management. Our risk portfolio of solutions manages market and credit risk and regulatory compliance for banks and actuarial risk for insurance firms.\nCorporate and Other\nThe Corporate and Other segment consists of corporate overhead expense, certain leveraged functions and miscellaneous expenses that are not included in the operating segments, as well as certain non-strategic businesses that we plan to wind down or sell. The overhead and leveraged costs relate to corporate marketing, finance, accounting, human resources, legal, compliance and internal audit functions, as well as other costs, such as acquisition, integration and transformation-related expenses and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, that are not considered when management evaluates revenue-generating segment performance. Our other operating income recorded in connection with our transaction services arrangements with Worldpay is also recorded in Corporate and Other. \nSales and Marketing \nOur sales personnel have expertise in particular solutions, geographic markets and industry verticals, as well as across our various client segments. We believe that focusing our expertise on clients in specific markets and tailoring integrated solution sets to participants in those markets enables us to better serve our clients and makes our offerings more attractive to prospects. The majority of our prospects are identified via direct and/or indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound lead generation, telesales and virtual sales efforts.\n6\nTable of \nContents\nOur global marketing team develops and leads the execution of global, role-specific and geography-based strategic marketing plans in support of the segments' reputation and relationship building goals in addition to their revenue and profitability goals. Key components of our strategic plans include brand amplification and digital enablement; market and competitive research; voice of the customer and client engagement; thought leadership; integrated go-to-market programs; internal communications and readiness; journalists and social media engagement; industry analyst relations; client events; trade shows; high-touch client programs; demand generation campaigns; account- and deal-based marketing programs; collateral development and management across digital and online channels; and the launch of new products to market. \nPatents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property\nIn general, we own the intellectual property and proprietary rights that are necessary to conduct our business and are important to our future success, including trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents. We license certain items from third parties under arms-length agreements for varying terms, including some \"open source\" licenses. \nWe rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents, trade secrets, copyrights and applicable law to establish and protect our software, technology and expertise worldwide. We rely on trademark law to protect our rights in our brands. We intend to continue taking commercially reasonable measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including by legal action when necessary and appropriate.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our solutions are intensely competitive across both established companies and new industry entrants. Depending on the business line, our primary competitors include, but are not limited to, internal technology or software development departments within financial institutions or other large companies; global and regional companies providing banking, payment and capital markets services; embedded payment solution providers; securities exchanges; asset managers; card associations; clearing networks or associations; trust companies; independent computer services firms; companies that develop verticalized software applications; companies owned by global banks selling competitive solutions; companies that provide customized development, implementation and support services; emerging technology innovators and business process outsourcing companies. Many of these companies compete with us across multiple solutions, market segments and geographies to varying degrees based on solution strength and distribution strength. Competitive factors impacting the success of our solutions include the quality of the technology-based application or service, breadth of application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, the ability to maintain, enhance and support the applications or solutions, price and overall client experience. We believe that we compete vigorously in each of these categories. In addition, we believe our domain expertise and the breadth and complementary nature of our portfolio of applications, services and integrated solutions enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings. Our ability to innovate and scale digital payments and solutions has been a competitive advantage as well.\nTechnology Development \nOur technology development activities primarily relate to the modernization of our proprietary core processing software applications and the design and development of next generation digital solutions, processing systems, software applications and risk management platforms. We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure. In addition, we intend to offer solutions compatible with new and emerging delivery channels.\nAs part of our technology development process, we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms. To this end, we engage with various hardware and software vendors in the evaluation of various new and existing technologies. Where appropriate, we use third-party technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings. We typically utilize enterprise license agreements or strive to ensure that either alternative suppliers or transfer rights exist in order to ensure the continuity of supply of third-party technology components used in the development of our software applications and service offerings. As a result, we are not materially dependent upon any third-party technology components. Third-party software may be used for highly specialized business functions depending on our ability to develop the functionality internally within time and budget constraints. Additionally, third-party software may be used for routine, commonplace functions within a technology platform environment. We work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introduce technology or infrastructure changes to our solutions.\n7\nTable of \nContents\nGovernment Regulation\nOur solutions are subject to a broad range of complex federal, state, and international regulations and requirements, as well as requirements under the rules of self-regulatory organizations including, without limitation, federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, federal, state and international money transmission laws, state cybersecurity protection laws, data protection and privacy laws, cyber resilience laws, artificial intelligence laws, usury laws, laws governing state trust charters, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Bank Service Company Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the United Kingdom (\"U.K\"). Money Laundering Regulations, the U.K. Proceeds of Crime Act, the U.K. Criminal Finances Act, the U.K. Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act, the U.K. Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act, European Union (\"E.U.\") Anti-Money Laundering Directives, the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 (the \"1940 Act\"), anti-corruption laws including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \"FCPA\") and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \"U.K. Bribery Act\"), the rules and regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (\"FFIEC\"), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"), the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. (\"FCA\"), the Central Bank of Ireland in the Republic of Ireland (\"CBI\"), the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier in Luxembourg (\"CSSF\"), the Jersey Financial Services Commission in Jersey, Channel Islands (\"JFSC\") and state financial services regulators (including enforcement of state cybersecurity laws). The compliance of our solutions with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors, including the manner in which our clients use them. In some cases, we are directly subject to regulatory oversight and examination. In other cases, our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations and utilize our solutions to achieve compliance with those laws and regulations. In some cases, we may be required to support our clients in achieving compliance with certain laws and regulations by virtue of the services that we provide to them. For example, under the E.U. Digital Operational Resilience Act (\"DORA\"), which came into force in January 2025, our E.U. financial entity clients will require us, as a third-party provider of information and communication technology services, to contract with and manage our relationships with them (and, where applicable, our relationships with critical third-party technology vendors in our supply chain) in accordance with the requirements of DORA. Failure to support our clients in achieving compliance with DORA and similar global regulatory regimes may cause us to lose revenue or clients and/or result in damage to our reputation, and may also attract scrutiny from regulators. In any event, the failure of our solutions to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in suspension or revocation of permission-based regulatory licenses, restrictions on our ability to provide those solutions, the imposition of civil fines and/or criminal penalties, loss of client trust, and/or reputational damage. Further, regulatory authorities have the power to, among other things, enjoin \"unsafe or unsound\" practices, require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice, issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced and direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets. We may be adversely affected by increased regulatory scrutiny or related negative publicity.\nThe principal areas of regulation impacting our business are the following:\n•\nOversight by Banking Regulators.\n As a provider of electronic data processing and back-office services to financial institutions, FIS is subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the FFIEC, an interagency body of federal banking regulators including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\"FRB\"), the National Credit Union Administration (\"NCUA\") (collectively, the Federal Banking Agencies or \"FBA\") and the CFPB, including as part of the Multi-Regional Data Processing Servicer (\"MDPS\") program. The MDPS program includes technology suppliers that provide mission-critical applications for a large number of financial institutions that are regulated by multiple regulatory agencies. Periodic information technology examination assessments are performed using FFIEC Interagency guidelines to identify potential risks that could adversely affect serviced financial institutions, determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations that affect the services provided to financial institutions, and ensure the solutions we provide to financial institutions do not create systemic risk to the banking system or impact the safe and sound operation of the financial institutions for which we process. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our clients. We are also subject to review and examination by state and international regulatory authorities under state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are described above, including electronic data processing, payments and back-office services for financial institutions and the use of consumer information.\n8\nTable of \nContents\nOur U.S.-based wealth and retirement business holds a charter in the state of Georgia, which makes us subject to the regulatory compliance requirements of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance. As a result, we are also authorized to provide trust services in various additional states subject to additional applicable state regulations.\n•\nPayment Services Oversight.\n Our payment services businesses provide technology services to U.S. financial institutions and are, therefore, subject to oversight and examination by the FFIEC. Our payment services businesses are also subject to regulation, supervision, and enforcement authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which include the CFPB and U.S. state regulators. These various regulatory regimes require compliance in respect of many aspects of our payment services businesses including without limitation corporate governance and oversight functions, capital requirements, liquidity, safeguarding, fee regulation adherence, technology and cyber resilience, anti-money laundering and sanctions. \n•\nAnti-Money Laundering.\n The Company is subject to, both directly and indirectly, various anti-money laundering laws and regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act in the United States and the Money Laundering Regulations and Proceeds of Crime Act in the U.K. These laws, among other requirements, impose obligations to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, file regulatory reports on large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and collect and maintain certain records related to customers and transactions. Many U.S. states have similar laws that overlap with, and in some cases diverge from, U.S. federal and international laws. While these federal, state and international laws are broadly consistent, there may be circumstances where the requirements of a particular jurisdiction conflict with those of other jurisdictions. As these laws continue to develop and expand, our investment in compliance with these laws continues to grow, as does the cost of ongoing compliance.\n•\nSanctions.\n The Company is subject to certain U.S. federal, state and international economic and trade sanctions programs, such as those that are administered by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (referred to as \"OFAC\"), which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, or dealings with, specified countries and regions, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Similar programs exist in a number of other jurisdictions, most notably those administered by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (\"OFSI\") in the U.K., E.U. sanctions, and United Nations sanctions. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with global economic sanctions programs which are increasingly complex and rapidly evolving in response to geopolitical events. Those policies and procedures require the screening of third parties with which the Company does business, including clients and vendors, and transactions where appropriate.\n•\nAnti-Corruption.\n The Company is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give, anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise to gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. The Company has implemented policies, procedures, training and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws, rules and regulations.\n•\nPrivacy and Data Protection.\n The Company is subject to an increasing number of privacy and data protection laws, regulations and directives globally, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") in the E.U., the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (\"VCDPA\"), the Colorado Privacy Act (\"CPA\"), the Connecticut Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act (\"CTDPA\"), the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"GLBA\"), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") in the United States; the U.K.'s General Data Protection Regulation (\"U.K. GDPR\") and Data Protection Act 2018; the General Personal Data Protection Act (\"LGPD\") in Brazil; the China Personal Information Protection Law (\"PIPL\"); and the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (\"APPI\") (referred to collectively as \"Privacy Laws\"). Many of these Privacy Laws place restrictions on the Company's ability to efficiently transfer, access and use personal data across its business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve.\nOur financial institution clients operating in the U.S. are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the GLBA and numerous similar state laws. GLBA and those state laws place restrictions on the use of non-public personal information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties. The regulations under GLBA, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. As a provider of solutions to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the \n9\nTable of \nContents\nPrivacy Laws and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves. A determination that there have been violations of Privacy Laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation. \nCertain operations of the Company are also subject to the newer, comprehensive, U.S. state-level Privacy Laws that provide consumers with additional data protection rights, including the right to be informed about the personal information collected by third parties and the use of that personal information, and which also impose obligations on companies in connection with the use of personal information.\nThe Company is subject to the E.U.’s GDPR, which applies to all organizations processing the personal data of individuals in the E.U., regardless of where such organization is based. The GDPR has heightened our privacy and data protection compliance obligations, impacted our businesses' collection, processing and retention of personal data and imposed stricter standards for reporting data breaches.\n•\nOversight by Securities Regulators. \nOur subsidiary that conducts our broker-dealer business in the U.S. is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, is a member of FINRA, and is registered as a broker-dealer in numerous states. Our broker-dealer is subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. In addition, FINRA, a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities, of its member firms, including our broker-dealer. State securities regulators and various exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange, also have regulatory or oversight authority over our broker-dealer. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices among broker-dealers, public and private securities offerings, use and safekeeping of customers' funds and securities, capital structure, record keeping, the financing of customers' purchases and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers and employees. In particular, as a registered broker-dealer and member of a self-regulatory organization, we are subject to the SEC's uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealer's assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC's uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital.\nOur subsidiaries also include an SEC-registered transfer agent. Our registered transfer agent is subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. These laws and regulations generally grant the SEC and other supervisory bodies broad administrative powers to address non-compliance with regulatory requirements. Sanctions that may be imposed for non-compliance with these requirements include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain activities for specified periods of time or for specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations, other censures and significant fines.\nSubsidiaries engaged in activities outside the U.S. are regulated by various government agencies in the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered, incorporated and/or conduct their business activity. For example, pursuant to the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (\"FSMA\"), certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations promulgated and administered by the FCA. The FSMA and rules promulgated thereunder govern all aspects of the U.K. investment business, including sales, research and trading practices, provision of investment advice, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, regulatory capital, recordkeeping, margin practices and procedures, approval standards for individuals, financial crime systems and controls, periodic reporting and settlement procedures.\n•\nMoney Transfer.\n Elements of our cash access and money transmission businesses are registered as a Money Services Business and are subject to various federal, state and international laws governing money transmission, including but not limited to the USA PATRIOT Act and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, as well as various U.S. federal, state and international sanctions requirements. These businesses may also be subject to certain state and local licensing requirements. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and licensing. In applicable states, we have obtained money transmitter licenses. However, changes to state money transmission laws and regulations, including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements, may result in the need for additional or expanded money transmitter licenses, additional capital allocations or changes in the way in which we deliver certain solutions.\n10\nTable of \nContents\n•\nConsumer Reporting and Protection.\n Our decision solutions subsidiary, ChexSystems, maintains a database of consumer information used to provide various account ope\nning services, including credit scoring analysis, and is subject to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\") and similar state laws. The FCRA regulates consumer reporting agencies (\"CRAs\"), including ChexSystems, and governs the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of CRAs that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating certain information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes. CRAs are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy of information concerning the individual to whom the report relates and, if a consumer disputes the accuracy of any information in the consumer's file, to conduct a reasonable investigation within statutory timelines. The FCRA imposes many other requirements on CRAs and users of consumer report information. Regulatory enforcement of the FCRA is under the purview of the United States Federal Trade Commission\n, the CFPB, and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with one another. CRAs are also regulated by a number of states, including New York, with consumer reporting laws that are not pre-empted by the FCRA. In furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy, fair treatment of consumers, protection of consumers' personal information, and compliance with these laws, we have made considerable investment to maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides, and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate accurate and timely handling of consumer requests for information and disputes. We also are focused on ensuring our operating environments safeguard and protect consumers' personal information in compliance with these laws.\nOur consumer reporting and consumer-facing businesses are subject to CFPB Bulletin 2013-7 (a successor to the former Regulation AA - Unfair Deceptive Acts or Practices), which defines Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices (\"UDAAP\"). This specific bulletin states that UDAAPs can cause significant financial injury to consumers, erode consumer confidence, and undermine fair competition in the financial marketplace. Original creditors and other covered persons and service providers under the Dodd-Frank Act involved in collecting debt related to any consumer \nfinancial product\n or service are subject to the prohibition against UDAAPs in the Dodd-Frank Act.\nIn addition, our U.K. regulated entity, Platform Securities LLP, is required to comply with the FCA’s Consumer Duty (the \"Duty\") in connection with its Wealth business. The Duty sets high standards of consumer protection across financial services and requires firms to put their customers' needs first.\n•\nDebt Collection.\n Our collection services are subject to the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements. The Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws.\nThe foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our Company is subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously. Enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business, directly and indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, and/or loss of revenue.\nHuman Capital Management\nEmployee Population\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had more than 50,000 employees, including over 32,000 employees principally employed outside of the U.S. None of our U.S. workforce currently is unionized. Approximately 6,000 of our employees, primarily in Brazil and Europe, are represented by labor unions or works councils as of December 31, 2024.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is a key priority. We have implemented a comprehensive wellness program focused on all aspects of employee wellness – physical, mental, social, and financial. Initiatives under this program are designed to promote healthy lifestyle habits. \nWe continue to operate FIS Cares, a global employee-funded giving program designed to help our employees in times of need. We remain committed to providing a safe working environment that minimizes health risks and prioritizes physical safety.\n11\nTable of \nContents\nCorporate Culture\nOur culture stems from embracing our corporate values as we work together to win as one team, lead with integrity and strive to \"be the change\" for our employees, clients and communities. We believe that inclusion and belonging are at the core of our corporate values. Our focus on continuous learning and a respectful, inclusive environment helps us use our collective strengths to innovate and deliver the best solutions for our clients and partners. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief People Officer regularly update our Board of Directors on human capital management and culture.\nTalent Management\nAlong with our clients and communities, our employees are primary stakeholders in our organization, and so we place a strategic priority on developing our talent and fostering a culture aligned with our corporate values and in which employees receive the support needed to grow and develop their skills and capabilities.\nOur talent development program provides an enterprise-wide, systematic foundation for career development tied to learning paths that enable skills development. Our talent practices are based on a future-focused development approach to equip FIS leaders with the skills required to enable business growth and exceed the needs of our clients. Our employees have a learning roadmap to ‘Build our Leaders of Tomorrow’ which is supported by access to an extensive selection of online self-paced learning resources, virtual instructor-led and face-to-face development offerings, and targeted development programs for high-potential and senior management employees. We engage in executive-level succession planning and provide extensive opportunities to apply for open roles within our organization.

As part of our business, FIS and its vendors, technology partners, and clients electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including sensitive customer information and consumer personal data. Our operations extend to managing payment systems, cash access and prepaid card systems. Cyberattacks on information technology systems and the vendors and technological supply chain they rely on continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. This is a trend we expect to continue. Cyberattacks have garnered significant attention from individuals, businesses, governmental entities and the media drawing the focus of a large ecosystem of criminal threat actors. The objectives of these cyberattacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, steal information, seek ransom payments from victims, perpetrate financial fraud, or sell stolen information. Perpetrators of cyberattacks attempt to exploit technical, human, social, and organizational vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. There is a growing trend of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in widely used technologies or vendor systems, allowing a single compromise or failure to extend unauthorized access to numerous systems.\nFIS takes actions to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats to our information systems and those of our vendors and technology partners. A significant focus of our ongoing efforts is how we identify these vulnerabilities and prevent and respond to cyberattacks. Our processes include the activities of the FIS Cyber Fusion Center, which provides 24x7x365 cybersecurity threat monitoring and response. They also include structured defense-in-depth initiatives, such as perimeter security, remote access security, endpoint security, application security and identity management. In addition, \nwe engage in extensive information security training of our employees who use and access our information systems.\n \nOur process for identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats includes regular communication with cyber experts, engagement of cybersecurity partners to review our systems, regular audits of our information security by third-party assessors and consultants, and regular interactions with vendors and technology partners to oversee and identify material risks associated with the information systems utilized by such persons.\nOur process of identifying and remediating cybersecurity risks has been integrated into our overall risk management system and processes.\n \nIt is overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Risk Officer, who report to our Board of Directors and its Risk and Technology Committee on a quarterly basis. The \nChief Information Security Officer\n provides ongoing oversight for the management of cybersecurity risks across the firm leveraging a series of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment routines.\n Risk escalations are facilitated through the enterprise risk management framework, including the Company's Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board of Directors via the Risk and Technology Committee. Facilitated via regular updates on cybersecurity risk, our Board of Directors takes an active role in overseeing, managing, and setting risk tolerances for our cybersecurity program.\n \nOur Chief Information Security Officer has over 15 years of technology and cybersecurity experience, including previous senior leadership roles at major financial institutions and possesses industry certifications such as the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).\n \nAdditional leaders and key contributors composing the cybersecurity leadership team possess specific expertise, certifications, and previous work experience aligned to their assigned responsibilities. \nOur Enterprise Risk Committee, responsible for providing oversight for cybersecurity risks, is a cross-functional representation of senior leadership with requisite experience and expertise to provide risk oversight, including the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, and FIS Business Presidents\n.\n \nFIS remains focused on making additional strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems from risks from cybersecurity threats. This includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses on hardware, software, staff and consulting services. These investments in the past have been and are reasonably likely to continue to be material to our results of operations. Further, notwithstanding our investments and other processes and efforts described above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we cannot guarantee that FIS will not be the subject of a cyberattack that would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
