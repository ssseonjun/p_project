The CSO participated in numerous exercises and crisis operations during his time in the military.  The CSO is a member of the Information Systems Audit and Control Association and a certified Information Privacy Manager from the International Association of Privacy Professionals.  The CSO also completed the Harvard Kennedy School Executive Education Program in Cybersecurity and the FBI Domestic Security Executive Academy.\nEntergy’s \nCISO\n is responsible for enterprise strategic and operational cybersecurity, physical security systems, and regulatory compliance.  The CISO oversees investments in tools, resources, and processes that allow for the continuous improvement and maturity of Entergy’s cybersecurity posture.  The CISO has expertise spanning more than 25 years in the realm of information technology, information security, and cyber/physical security management.  The CISO’s background includes serving as the Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer for an electric utility with responsibility for enterprise cybersecurity covering corporate, electric, nuclear, and gas operations.  Additionally, the CISO served as the Chief Security Officer for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas with overall responsibility for its cybersecurity, physical security, and emergency management programs.  Her previous experience includes multiple technical, managerial, and strategic roles within industries ranging from energy, telecommunication, software development, and cybersecurity consulting.  The CISO is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, Certified Information Security Manager, and Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control.\nEntergy’s \nCIO\n is responsible for ensuring that the organization’s information technology systems, infrastructure, and applications are designed, implemented, and maintained to provide secure and reliable performance in support of Entergy’s business objectives.  The CIO establishes and enforces IT policies, procedures, and controls to mitigate information technology policies, procedures, and controls to mitigate information technology-related risks and provides guidance and support to the business units in the effective use of information technology resources and the management of information technology-related risks.  By fulfilling these responsibilities across the three lines of defense model, the CIO plays a critical role in ensuring that Entergy’s information technology-related risks are effectively identified, managed, and mitigated, thereby supporting Entergy’s overall risk management and governance framework.  The CIO’s background includes serving in senior leadership roles, including CIO for multiple global manufacturing companies, serving on the board of directors for a telecommunications company, and consulting leadership positions providing services for numerous large, global organizations.\nIn the event of a suspected or actual cybersecurity incident, the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT), which includes the CISO, has primary responsibility for initial identification and evaluation of potential business impacts and escalation of the incident’s severity classification using pre-established criteria with a specified communication matrix and escalation thresholds.  The Security Incident Commander, which role is served by rotating leaders in the CISO organization, provides tactical leadership and oversight management at the cross-functional level for the incident.  The SIRT remains engaged throughout the incident response lifecycle, including detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident remediation, and coordinates with the impacted business functions, if warranted.  Once a cyber incident is confirmed, the SIRT is responsible for maintaining situational awareness and continuous monitoring of the need for escalation or de-escalation of the incident’s severity classification.  As certain escalation thresholds are exceeded, additional levels of management notification are required by the SIRT, including notification of and recurring communication with Entergy’s Incident Response Team, which includes the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the CSO, other executive management, and members of the affected business functions.  \nDepending upon the facts, analysis, materiality, and anticipated or current impacts, the Chief Executive Officer and the General Counsel will determine the timing and cadence for communication of the cyber incident with the Board of Directors or Audit Committee.\n317\nTable of Contents\nENTERGY ARKANSAS, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nResults of Operations\n2024 Compared to 2023\nNet Income\nNet income decreased $77.4 million primarily due to a $159.6 million reduction in income tax expense in 2023 as a result of the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit and a $131.8 million ($99.1 million net-of-tax) charge to reflect the write-off of a previously recorded regulatory asset as a result of an adverse decision in the opportunity sales proceeding in March 2024.  The decrease was partially offset by write-offs of $78.4 million ($58.8 million net-of-tax) in third quarter 2023 as a result of\n Entergy Arkansas’s approved motion to forgo recovery of identified costs resulting from the \n2013 ANO stator incident, higher retail electric price, higher volume/weather, and higher other income.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit.  \nSee Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the \nopportunity sales proceeding.  \nSee Note 8 to the financial statements for further discussion of the ANO stator incident and the approved motion to forgo recovery.\nOperating Revenues\nFollowing is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2024 to 2023:\nAmount\n(In Millions)\n2023 operating revenues\n$2,646.4 \nFuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income\n(202.1)\nRetail one-time bill credit\n(92.3)\nVolume/weather\n37.8 \nRetail electric price\n70.4 \n2024 operating revenues\n$2,460.2\n \nEntergy Arkansas’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income.  “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.\nThe retail one-time bill credit represents the disbursement of settlement proceeds in the form of a one-time bill credit provided to Entergy Arkansas’s retail customers during the August 2024 billing cycle \nthrough the Grand Gulf credit rider \nas a result of the System Energy settlement with the APSC.  \nThere is no effect on net income because Entergy Arkansas previously recorded a regulatory liability for the effects of the System Energy settlement with the APSC.  \nSee Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the System Energy settlement with the APSC and discussion of the Grand Gulf credit rider.\nThe volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in residential and industrial usage.\n \nThe increase in residential usage is primarily due to an increase in customers.\n  The increase in industrial usage is primarily due to an increase in demand from large industrial customers, primarily new customers in the technology industry, and an increase in demand from small industrial customers.\n318\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nThe retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan rates effective January 2024.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the 2023 formula rate plan filing.\nTotal electric energy sales for Entergy Arkansas for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n(GWh)\nResidential\n7,658 \n7,610 \n1 \nCommercial\n5,583 \n5,584 \n— \nIndustrial\n10,179 \n9,095 \n12 \nGovernmental\n185 \n192 \n(4)\n  Total retail  \n23,605 \n22,481 \n5 \nSales for resale:\n  Associated companies\n2,039 \n2,218 \n(8)\n  Non-associated companies\n4,058 \n5,777 \n(30)\nTotal\n29,702 \n30,476 \n(3)\nSee Note 19 to the financial statements for additional discussion of Entergy Arkansas’s operating revenues.\nOther Income Statement Variances\nOther operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:\n•\nan increase of $11.2 million in energy efficiency expenses primarily due to \nthe timing of recovery from customers;\n•\nthe effects of recording a final judgment in first quarter 2023 to resolve claims in the ANO damages case against the DOE related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs.  The damages awarded included the reimbursement of approximately $10.3 million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expenses.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation; and\n•\nan increase of $7.2 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher healthcare claims activity, including lower prescription drug rebates in 2024 as compared to 2023, and higher incentive-based accruals in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nThe increase was partially offset by:\n•\na decrease of $11.3 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to lower nuclear labor costs;\n•\na decrease of $8.8 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to lower vegetation maintenance costs; and\n•\na decrease of $4.4 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work during plant outages performed in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nAsset write-offs includes:\n•\na $131.8 million charge to reflect the write-off of a previously recorded regulatory asset as a result of an adverse decision in the opportunity sales proceeding in March 2024.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the opportunity sales proceeding; and\n•\nthe effects of Entergy Arkansas forgoing recovery of identified costs resulting from the 2013 ANO stator incident.  In third quarter 2023, Entergy Arkansas recorded write-offs of its regulatory asset for deferred \n319\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nfuel of $68.9 million and the undepreciated balance of $9.5 million in capital costs related to the ANO stator incident\n.  \nSee Note 8 to the financial statements for further discussion of the ANO stator incident and the approved motion to forgo recovery.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, including the Walnut Bend Solar facility, which was placed in service in September 2024.\nOther regulatory charges (credits) - net includes:\n•\nthe reversal in third quarter 2024 of a $92.3 million regulatory liability recognized for the obligation to return to customers the refund from the System Energy settlement with the APSC.  The reversal of the regulatory liability offsets a reduction in gross revenues from the retail one-time bill credits provided to customers in the August 2024 billing cycle through the Grand Gulf credit rider.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the System Energy settlement with the APSC and discussion of the Grand Gulf credit rider; and\n•\na regulatory credit of $15.5 million, recorded in fourth quarter 2024, \nto reflect the amount of the 2023 historical year netting adjustment included in the 2024 formula rate plan filing that it expects to collect from its customers during the 2025 rate effective period\n.  \nSee Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the 2024 \nformula rate plan filing.\nIn addition, Entergy Arkansas records a regulatory charge or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and nuclear decommissioning trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue.\nOther income increased primarily due to:\n•\nchanges in decommissioning trust fund activity, including portfolio rebalancing of decommissioning trust funds in first quarter 2024;\n•\nhigher interest earned on money pool investments;\n•\na decrease of $12.9 million in non-service pension costs primarily as a result of pension settlement charges recorded in 2023 and a reduction in 2024 in the amortization of deferred pension losses as a result of an amendment to a qualified pension plan spinning-off predominantly inactive participants into a new qualified plan, extending the amortization period for deferred losses.  See \n“\nMANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - \nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs; and\n•\nan increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2024, including the Driver Solar facility and the Walnut Bend Solar facility projects.\nInterest expense increased primarily due to the issuances of $400 million of 5.75% Series mortgage bonds and $400 million of 5.45% Series mortgage bonds, each in May 2024, and the issuance of $300 million of 5.30% Series mortgage bonds in August 2023.  The increase was partially offset by:\n•\nthe repayment of $375 million of 3.70% Series mortgage bonds in June 2024;\n•\nthe repayment of $250 million of 3.05% Series mortgage bonds in June 2023; and\n•\nan increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2024,\n \nincluding the Driver Solar facility and the Walnut Bend Solar facility projects.\nThe effective income tax rates were 18.9% for 2024 and (33.3%) for 2023.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates and for additional discussion regarding income taxes.\n320\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\n2023 Compared to 2022\nSee “\nMANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n - \nResults of Operations\n” in Item 7 of Entergy Arkansas’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, for discussion of results of operations for 2023 compared to 2022.\nIncome Tax Legislation and Regulation\nSee the “\nIncome Tax Legislation and Regulation\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of income tax legislation and regulation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow\nCash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In Thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n$3,632 \n$5,278 \n$12,915 \nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n978,680 \n941,021 \n699,732 \nInvesting activities\n(1,732,630)\n(1,032,952)\n(852,794)\nFinancing activities\n755,065 \n90,285 \n145,425 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n1,115 \n(1,646)\n(7,637)\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n$4,747 \n$3,632 \n$5,278 \n2024 Compared to 2023\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities increased $37.7 million in 2024 primarily due to:\n•\nlower fuel and purchased power payments;\n•\nthe timing of payments to vendors;\n•\na decrease of $34.1 million in storm spending in 2024 as compared to 2023;\n•\nhigher collections from customers; and\n•\nthe receipt of $92.7 million in settlement proceeds in 2024 as a result of the System Energy settlement with the APSC, which was subsequently refunded to retail customers in third quarter 2024 with one-time bill credits through the Grand Gulf credit rider.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the System Energy settlement with the APSC and discussion of the Grand Gulf credit rider.\nThe increase was partially offset by:\n•\nthe timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery;\n•\nan increase of $43.5 million in interest paid;\n•\nthe refund of $41.7 million received from System Energy in January 2023 related to the sale-leaseback renewal costs and depreciation litigation as calculated in System Energy’s January 2023 compliance report \n321\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nfiled with the FERC.

See Note 2 \nto the financial statements\n for further discussion of the refund and the related proceedings;\n•\n$23.2 million in proceeds received from the DOE in April 2023 resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously expensed.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation; and\n•\nan increase of $8.1 million in spending on nuclear refueling outages in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flow used in investing activities increased $699.7 million in 2024 primarily due to:\n•\nthe initial and substantial completion payments totaling approximately $392.8 million in 2024 for the purchase of the Driver Solar facility;\n•\nthe initial and substantial completion payments totaling approximately $240.4 million in 2024 for the purchase of the West Memphis Solar facility;\n•\nthe initial and substantial completion payments totaling approximately $185.5 million in 2024 for the purchase of the Walnut Bend Solar facility;\n•\nan increase of $18.7 million in nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to increased spending on various nuclear projects in 2024;\n•\n$17.9 million in proceeds received from the DOE in April 2023 resulting from litigation regarding spent nuclear fuel storage costs that were previously recorded as construction expenditures.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation; and\n•\nan increase in cash used of $13.7 million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity due to variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements, materials and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle.\nThe increase was partially offset by a decrease of $156.1 million in distribution construction expenditures and a decrease of $15.6 million in transmission construction expenditures, both primarily due to lower capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2024.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the Driver Solar facility, the West Memphis Solar facility, and the Walnut Bend Solar facility purchases.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities increased $664.8 million in 2024 primarily due to:\n•\nthe issuances of $400 million of 5.45% Series mortgage bonds and $400 million of 5.75% Series mortgage bonds, each in May 2024;\n•\ncapital contributions of approximately $695 million received from Entergy Corporation in 2024 to partially finance the acquisitions of the Walnut Bend Solar facility, the West Memphis Solar facility, and the Driver Solar facility;\n•\nthe repayment, at maturity, of $250 million of 3.05% Series mortgage bonds in June 2023;\n•\na decrease of $107 million in common equity distributions paid in 2024 in order to maintain Entergy Arkansas’s capital structure;\n•\nthe issuance of $70 million of 5.54% Series O notes by the Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in March 2024;\n•\nthe repayment, at maturity, of $40 million of 3.17% Series M notes by the Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in December 2023; and\n•\nan increase of $18.4 million in advance payments from customers for construction for transmission, distribution, and generator interconnection agreements.\n322\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nThe increase was partially offset by:\n•\nthe issuance of $425 million of 5.15% Series mortgage bonds in January 2023;\n•\nthe repayment, at maturity, of $375 million of 3.70% Series mortgage bonds in June 2024;\n•\nthe issuance of $300 million of 5.30% Series mortgage bonds in August 2023;\n•\nnet repayments of $47.7 million in 2024 as compared to net long-term borrowings of $70.2 million in 2023 on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility; and\n•\nmoney pool activity.\nDecreases in Entergy Arkansas’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas’s payable to the money pool decreased $130.2 million in 2024 compared to decreasing by $35.4 million in 2023.  The money pool is an intercompany cash management program that makes possible intercompany borrowing and lending arrangements, and the money pool and other borrowing arrangements are designed to reduce the Registrant Subsidiaries’ dependence on external short-term borrowings.\nSee Note 5 to the financial statements for further details of long-term debt.\n2023 Compared to 2022\nSee “\nMANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n - \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n - \nCash Flow\n” in Item 7 of Entergy Arkansas’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2023 compared to 2022.\nCapital Structure\nEntergy Arkansas’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table.  The decrease in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Arkansas is primarily due to capital contributions of $695 million received from Entergy Corporation in 2024, partially offset by the net issuance of long-term debt in 2024.\n \nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nDebt to capital\n53.6 \n%\n55.5 \n%\nEffect of subtracting cash\n— \n%\n— \n%\nNet debt to net capital (non-GAAP)\n53.6 \n%\n55.5 \n%\nNet debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion.  Capital consists of debt and equity.  Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.  Entergy Arkansas uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas’s financial condition.  The net debt to net capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure.  Entergy Arkansas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Arkansas’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nEntergy Arkansas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings.  To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.  To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Arkansas may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to \n323\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nmaintain its capital structure.  In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reduced distributions, Entergy Arkansas may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure.\nUses of Capital\nEntergy Arkansas requires capital resources for:\n•\nconstruction and other capital investments;\n•\ndebt maturities or retirements;\n•\nworking capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and\n•\ndistribution and interest payments.\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas’s planned construction and other capital investments.\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n \n(In Millions)\nPlanned construction and capital investment:\n \n \nGeneration\n$355 \n$260 \n$250 \nTransmission\n80 \n70 \n95 \nDistribution\n360 \n290 \n310 \nUtility Support\n80 \n70 \n65 \nTotal\n$875 \n$690 \n$720 \nIn addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Arkansas includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, expand, and diversify Entergy Arkansas’s portfolio; investments in ANO 1 and 2; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to improve reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion; and other investments.  Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, governmental actions, including trade-related governmental actions, such as tariffs and other measures, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital, including any changes to governmental programs, such as loans, grants, guarantees, and other subsidies.  Entergy Arkansas is not able to predict the effect of potential changes in regulation and law, changes to governmental programs, such as loans, grants, guarantees, and other subsidies, and trade-related governmental actions, such as tariffs and other measures, on its current and planned capital projects.\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments).\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028-2029\nAfter 2029\n \n(In Millions)\nLong-term debt (a)\n$211 \n$885 \n$210 \n$770 \n$6,858 \nOperating leases (b)\n$20 \n$18 \n$15 \n$14 \n$5 \nFinance leases (b)\n$6 \n$6 \n$5 \n$9 \n$24 \n(a)\nLong-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n(b)\nLease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.\n324\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nOther Obligations\nEntergy Arkansas currently expects to contribute approximately $35.5 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $529 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2025, although the 2025 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2025, valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2025.  See “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \n– Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.\nEntergy Arkansas has $15.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes plus interest for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn addition, Entergy Arkansas enters into fuel and purchased power agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations.  Entergy Arkansas has rate mechanisms in place to recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs incurred under these purchase obligations.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy Arkansas’s obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.\nAs a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy Arkansas pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly.\nLake Catherine Unit 5\nIn November 2024, Entergy Arkansas filed an application with the APSC seeking a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need for the construction and operation of Lake Catherine Unit 5, a 446 MW hydrogen-capable simple-cycle natural gas combustion turbine facility to be located at the existing Lake Catherine facility site in Hot Spring County, Arkansas.  In December 2024 other parties, including the APSC general staff, filed testimony opposing the resource, although the APSC general staff recognized the capacity need for the resource.  Entergy Arkansas filed testimony in January 2025 further supporting its application, and in February 2025 the opposing parties filed responsive rebuttal testimony continuing to dispute the estimated costs and to dispute that Entergy Arkansas performed a market solicitation sufficient to demonstrate that this resource is the most reasonable option for customers.  Also in February 2025, Entergy Arkansas filed surrebuttal testimony responding to the opposing parties’ testimony.  A hearing, if necessary, is scheduled for early March 2025, with an APSC decision requested by the end of March 2025.  Subject to receipt of required regulatory approval and other conditions, the facility is expected to be in service by the end of 2028.\nSources of Capital\nEntergy Arkansas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:\n•\ninternally generated funds;\n•\ncash on hand;\n•\nthe Entergy system money pool;\n•\ndebt or preferred membership interest issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness;\n•\ncapital contributions; and\n•\nbank financing under new or existing facilities.\nCircumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future.  In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, \n325\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nEntergy Arkansas expects to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit.\nAll debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Arkansas require prior regulatory approval.  Debt issuances are also subject to requirements set forth in Entergy Arkansas’s bond indenture and other agreements.  Entergy Arkansas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\nEntergy Arkansas’s payables to the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n(In Thousands)\n($15,190)\n($145,385)\n($180,795)\n($139,904)\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.\nEntergy Arkansas has a credit facility in the amount of $300 million scheduled to expire in June 2029.  Entergy Arkansas also has a $25 million credit facility scheduled to expire in April 2026.  The $300 million credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $5 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility.  As of December 31, 2024, there were no cash borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facilities.  In addition, Entergy Arkansas is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO.  As of December 31, 2024, there were $18.1 million in letters of credit outstanding under Entergy Arkansas’s uncommitted letter of credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of the credit facilities.\nThe Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity has a credit facility in the amount of $80 million scheduled to expire in June 2027.  As of December 31, 2024, there were $22.5 million in loans outstanding under the credit facility for the Entergy Arkansas nuclear fuel company variable interest entity.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility.\nEntergy Arkansas obtained authorization from the FERC through January 2027 for short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $250 million at any time outstanding and borrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entity.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Arkansas’s short-term borrowing limits.  The long-term securities issuances of Entergy Arkansas are limited to amounts authorized by the FERC.  The APSC has concurrent jurisdiction over Entergy Arkansas’s first mortgage bond/secured issuances.  Entergy Arkansas has obtained long-term financing authorization from the FERC that extends through January 2027.  Entergy Arkansas has obtained first mortgage bond/secured financing authorization from the APSC that extends through December 2025.\n326\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nState and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery\nThe rates that Entergy Arkansas charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy Arkansas is regulated, and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings.  A governmental agency, the APSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.\nRetail Rates\n2022 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn July 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2022 formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2023 calendar year.  The filing contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas’s earnings for the projected year 2023 and a netting adjustment for the historical year 2021.  The filing showed that Entergy Arkansas’s earned rate of return on common equity for the 2023 projected year was 7.40% resulting in a revenue deficiency of $104.8 million.  The earned rate of return on common equity for the 2021 historical year was 8.38% resulting in a $15.2 million netting adjustment.  The total proposed revenue change for the 2023 projected year and 2021 historical year netting adjustment was $119.9 million.  By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas’s recovery of the revenue requirement is subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint.  Because Entergy Arkansas’s revenue requirement in this filing exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to $79.3 million.  In October 2022 other parties filed their testimony recommending various adjustments to Entergy Arkansas’s overall proposed revenue deficiency, and Entergy Arkansas filed a response including an update to actual revenues through August 2022, which raised the constraint to $79.8 million.  In November 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a settlement agreement reached with other parties resolving all issues in the proceeding.  As a result of the settlement agreement, the total revenue change was $102.8 million, including a $87.7 million increase for the 2023 projected year and a $15.2 million netting adjustment.  Because Entergy Arkansas’s revenue requirement exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to $79.8 million.  In December 2022 the APSC approved the settlement agreement as being in the public interest and approved Entergy Arkansas’s compliance tariff effective with the first billing cycle of January 2023.\n2023 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn July 2023, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2023 formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2024 calendar year.  The filing contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas’s earnings for the projected year 2024 and a netting adjustment for the historical year 2022.  The filing showed that Entergy Arkansas’s earned rate of return on common equity for the 2024 projected year was 8.11% resulting in a revenue deficiency of $80.5 million.  The earned rate of return on common equity for the 2022 historical year was 7.29% resulting in a $49.8 million netting adjustment.  The total proposed revenue change for the 2024 projected year and 2022 historical year netting adjustment was $130.3 million.  By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas’s recovery of the revenue requirement is subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint.  Because Entergy Arkansas’s revenue requirement in this filing exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to $88.6 million.  The APSC general staff and intervenors filed their errors and objections in October 2023, proposing certain adjustments, including the APSC general staff’s update to annual filing year revenues which lowers the constraint to $87.7 million.  Entergy Arkansas filed its rebuttal in October 2023.  In October 2023, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a settlement agreement reached with other parties resolving all issues in the proceeding, none of which affected Entergy Arkansas’s requested recovery up to the constraint of $87.7 million.  The settlement agreement provided for amortization of the approximately $39 million regulatory asset for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic over a 10-year period as well as recovery of $34.9 million related to the resolution of the 2016 and 2017 IRS audits from previous tax positions that are no longer uncertain, partially offset by $24.7 million in excess accumulated deferred income taxes from reductions in state income tax rates, each before consideration of their respective tax gross-up.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit and the State of Arkansas corporate income tax rate changes.  In December \n327\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\n2023 the APSC approved the settlement agreement as being in the public interest and approved Entergy Arkansas’s compliance tariff effective with the first billing cycle of January 2024.\n2024 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn July 2024, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC its 2024 formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2025 calendar year.  The filing contained an evaluation of Entergy Arkansas’s earnings for the 2025 projected year and a netting adjustment for the 2023 historical year.  The filing showed that Entergy Arkansas’s earned rate of return on common equity for the 2025 projected year was 8.43% resulting in a revenue deficiency of $69.5 million.  The earned rate of return on common equity for the 2023 historical year was 7.48% resulting in a $33.1 million netting adjustment.  The total proposed revenue change for the 2025 projected year and 2023 historical year netting adjustment is $102.6 million.  By operation of the formula rate plan, Entergy Arkansas’s recovery of the revenue requirement is subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint.  Because Entergy Arkansas’s revenue requirement in this filing exceeded the constraint, the resulting increase was limited to $82.6 million.  The APSC general staff and intervenors filed their errors and objections in October 2024, proposing certain adjustments, including the APSC general staff’s update to annual filing year revenues that increases the constraint to $83.5 million.  Entergy Arkansas filed its rebuttal in October 2024, and later in October 2024 the parties submitted a joint issues list and stipulations setting forth the disputed issues and the noncontested issues.  In December 2024 the APSC approved the parties’ stipulations without modification, approved Entergy Arkansas’s adjustment with respect to storm costs, directed Entergy Arkansas to adjust its projected year distribution reliability capital closings, and deferred the recoverability of Entergy Arkansas’s opportunity sales legal fees until the next general rate case.  Also in December 2024 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas’s compliance tariff effective with the first billing cycle of January 2025.  As a result of the proceeding, the total revenue change was $82.7 million, including a $63.7 million increase for the 2025 projected year and a $31.4 million netting adjustment for the 2023 historical year.  In fourth quarter 2024, Entergy Arkansas recorded a regulatory asset of $15.5 million to reflect the amount of the 2023 historical year netting adjustment that it expects to collect from its customers during the 2025 rate effective period.  Pursuant to the terms of the parties’ stipulations, Entergy Arkansas made a filing with the APSC in January 2025 to refund customers $30.1 million in excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the reduction in the State of Arkansas’s income tax rate from 4.8% to 4.3% in 2024.  Entergy Arkansas will make this refund over a 24-month period effective with the first billing cycle of February 2025.\nGrand Gulf Credit Rider\nIn June 2024, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a tariff to provide retail customers a credit resulting from the terms of the settlement agreement between Entergy Arkansas, System Energy, additional named Entergy parties, and the APSC pertaining to System Energy’s billings for wholesale sales of energy and capacity from the Grand Gulf nuclear plant.  See\n “\nComplaints Against System Energy\n \n- \nSystem Energy Settlement with the APSC\n” in Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the settlement.  \nIn July 2024 the APSC approved the tariff, under which Entergy Arkansas will refund to retail customers a total of $100.6 million.  To date, Entergy Arkansas has refunded $92.3 million of the total through one-time bill credits during the August 2024 billing cycle and is finalizing plans for the refund of the remaining regulatory liability balance.\nEnergy Cost Recovery Rider\nEntergy Arkansas’s retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills.  The rider utilizes the prior calendar-year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over- or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy costs for the prior calendar year.  The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.\n328\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nIn January 2014, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion with the APSC relating to its upcoming energy cost rate redetermination filing that was made in March 2014.  In that motion, Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to exclude from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate $65.9 million of incremental fuel and replacement energy costs incurred in 2013 as a result of the ANO stator incident.  Entergy Arkansas requested that the APSC authorize Entergy Arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information was available regarding various claims associated with the ANO stator incident.  In February 2014 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas’s request to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance.  In July 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed for a change in rates pursuant to its formula rate plan rider.  In that proceeding, the APSC approved a settlement agreement agreed upon by the parties, including a provision that requires Entergy Arkansas to initiate a regulatory proceeding for the purpose of recovering funds currently withheld from rates and related to the stator incident, including the $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs and costs related to the incremental oversight previously noted, subject to certain timelines and conditions set forth in the settlement agreement.  In October 2023, Entergy Arkansas made a commitment to the APSC to make a filing to forgo its opportunity to seek recovery of the incremental fuel and purchased energy expense, among other identified costs, resulting from the ANO stator incident.  As a result, in third quarter 2023, Entergy Arkansas recorded a write-off of its regulatory asset for deferred fuel of $68.9 million, which includes interest, related to the ANO stator incident.  Consistent with its October 2023 commitment, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion to forgo recovery in November 2023, and the motion was approved by the APSC in December 2023.  See the “\nANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews\n” section in Note 8 to the financial statements \nfor further discussion of the ANO stator incident and the approved motion to forgo recovery\n.\nIn March 2017, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from $0.01164 per kWh to $0.01547 per kWh.  The APSC staff filed testimony in March 2017 recommending that the redetermined rate be implemented with the first billing cycle of April 2017 under the normal operation of the tariff.  Accordingly, the redetermined rate went into effect on March 31, 2017 pursuant to the tariff.  In July 2017 the Arkansas Attorney General requested additional information to support certain of the costs included in Entergy Arkansas’s 2017 energy cost rate redetermination.\nIn March 2018, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from $0.01547 per kWh to $0.01882 per kWh.  The Arkansas Attorney General filed a response to Entergy Arkansas’s annual redetermination filing requesting that the APSC suspend the proposed tariff to investigate the amount of the redetermination or, alternatively, to allow recovery subject to refund.  Among the reasons the Attorney General cited for suspension were questions pertaining to how Entergy Arkansas forecasted sales and potential implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  Entergy Arkansas replied to the Attorney General’s filing and stated that, to the extent there are questions pertaining to its load forecasting or the operation of the energy cost recovery rider, those issues exceed the scope of the instant rate redetermination.  Entergy Arkansas also stated that potential effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are appropriately considered in the APSC’s separate proceeding regarding potential implications of the tax law.  The APSC general staff filed a reply to the Attorney General’s filing and agreed that Entergy Arkansas’s filing complied with the terms of the energy cost recovery rider.  The redetermined rate became effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018.  Subsequently in April 2018 the APSC issued an order declining to suspend Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery rider rate and declining to require further investigation at that time of the issues suggested by the Attorney General in the proceeding.  Following a period of discovery, the Attorney General filed a supplemental response in October 2018 raising new issues with Entergy Arkansas’s March 2018 rate redetermination and asserting that $45.7 million of the increase should be collected subject to refund pending further investigation.  Entergy Arkansas filed to dismiss the Attorney General’s supplemental response, the APSC general staff filed a motion to strike the Attorney General’s filing, and the Attorney General filed a supplemental response disputing Entergy Arkansas and the APSC staff’s filing.  Applicable APSC rules and processes authorize its general staff to initiate periodic audits of Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery rider.  In late-2018 the APSC general staff notified Entergy Arkansas it initiated an audit of the 2017 fuel costs.  The time in which the audit will be complete is uncertain at this time.\n329\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nIn March 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from $0.00959 per kWh to $0.01785 per kWh.  The primary reason for the rate increase was a large under-recovered balance as a result of higher natural gas prices in 2021, particularly in the fourth quarter 2021.  At the request of the APSC general staff, Entergy Arkansas deferred its request for recovery of $32 million from the under-recovery related to the February 2021 winter storms until the 2023 energy cost rate redetermination, unless a request for an interim adjustment to the energy cost recovery rider is necessary.  This resulted in a redetermined rate of $0.016390 per kWh, which became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2022 through the normal operation of the tariff.  In February 2023 the APSC issued orders initiating proceedings with the utilities under its jurisdiction to address the prudence of costs incurred and appropriate cost allocation of the February 2021 winter storms.  With respect to any prudence review of Entergy Arkansas fuel costs, as part of the APSC’s draft report issued in its February 2021 winter storms investigation docket, the APSC included findings that the load shedding plans of the investor-owned utilities and some cooperatives were appropriate and comprehensive, and, further, that Entergy Arkansas’s emergency plan was comprehensive and had a multilayered approach supported by a system-wide response plan, which is considered an industry standard.  In September 2023 the APSC issued an order in Entergy Arkansas's company-specific proceeding and found that Entergy Arkansas’s practices during the winter storms were prudent.\nIn March 2023, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from $0.01639 per kWh to $0.01883 per kWh.  The primary reason for the rate increase is a large under-recovered balance as a result of higher natural gas prices in 2022 and a $32 million deferral related to the February 2021 winter storms consistent with the APSC general staff’s request in 2022.  The under-recovered balance included in the filing was partially offset by the proceeds of the $41.7 million refund that System Energy made to Entergy Arkansas in January 2023 related to the sale-leaseback renewal costs and depreciation litigation as calculated in System Energy’s January 2023 compliance report filed with the FERC.  See “\nComplaints Against System Energy\n - Grand Gulf Sale-leaseback Renewal Complaint and Uncertain Tax Position Rate Base Issue\n” in Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the compliance report filed by System Energy with the FERC in January 2023.  The redetermined rate of $0.01883 per kWh became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2023 through the normal operation of the tariff.\nIn March 2024, Entergy Arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected a decrease in the rate from $0.01883 per kWh to $0.00882 per kWh.  Due to a change in law in the State of Arkansas, the annual redetermination included $9 million, recorded as a credit to fuel expense in first quarter 2024, for recovery attributed to net metering costs in 2023.  The primary reason for the rate decrease is a large over-recovered balance as a result of lower natural gas prices in 2023.  To mitigate the effect of projected increases in natural gas prices in 2024, Entergy Arkansas adjusted the over-recovered balance included in the March 2024 annual redetermination filing by $43.7 million.  This adjustment is expected to reduce the rate change that will be reflected in the 2025 energy cost rate redetermination.  The redetermined rate of $0.00882 per kWh became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2024 through the normal operation of the tariff.\nOpportunity Sales Proceeding\nIn June 2009 the LPSC filed a complaint requesting that the FERC determine that certain of Entergy Arkansas’s sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the System Agreement that allocated the energy generated by Entergy System resources; (b) imprudently denied the Entergy System and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost Entergy System generating capacity; and (c) violated the provision of the System Agreement that prohibited sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other Utility operating companies.  The LPSC’s complaint challenged sales made beginning in 2002 and requested refunds.  In July 2009 the Utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint arguing among other things that the System Agreement contemplates that the Utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the applicable Utility operating company.  The FERC subsequently ordered a hearing in the proceeding.\n330\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nAfter a hearing, the ALJ issued an initial decision in December 2010.  The ALJ found that the System Agreement allowed for Entergy Arkansas to make the sales to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the same manner as joint account sales.  The ALJ concluded that “shareholders” should make refunds of the damages to the Utility operating companies, along with interest.  Entergy disagreed with several aspects of the ALJ’s initial decision and in January 2011 filed with the FERC exceptions to the decision.\nThe FERC issued a decision in June 2012 and held that, while the System Agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual Utility operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and Entergy Arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith.  The FERC found, however, that the System Agreement does not provide authority for an individual Utility operating company to allocate the energy associated with such opportunity sales as part of its load but provides a different allocation authority.  The FERC further found that the after-the-fact accounting methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales was inconsistent with the System Agreement.  The FERC in its decision established further hearing procedures to quantify the effect of repricing the opportunity sales in accordance with the FERC’s June 2012 decision.  The hearing was held in May 2013 and the ALJ issued an initial decision in August 2013.  The LPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and FERC staff filed briefs on exceptions and/or briefs opposing exceptions.  Entergy filed a brief on exceptions requesting that the FERC reverse the initial decision and a brief opposing certain exceptions taken by the LPSC and FERC staff.\nIn April 2016 the FERC issued orders addressing requests for rehearing filed in July 2012 and the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision.  The first order denied Entergy’s request for rehearing and affirmed the FERC’s earlier rulings that Entergy’s original methodology for allocating energy costs to the opportunity sales was incorrect and, as a result, Entergy Arkansas must make payments to the other Utility operating companies to put them in the same position that they would have been in absent the incorrect allocation.  The FERC clarified that interest should be included with the payments.  The second order affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the rulings in the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision regarding the methodology that should be used to calculate the payments Entergy Arkansas is to make to the other Utility operating companies.  The FERC affirmed the ALJ’s ruling that a full re-run of intra-system bills should be performed but required that methodology be modified so that the sales have the same priority for purposes of energy allocation as joint account sales.  The FERC reversed the ALJ’s decision that any payments by Entergy Arkansas should be reduced by 20%.  The FERC also reversed the ALJ’s decision that adjustments to other System Agreement service schedules and excess bandwidth payments should not be taken into account when calculating the payments to be made by Entergy Arkansas.  The FERC held that such adjustments and excess bandwidth payments should be taken into account but ordered further proceedings before an ALJ to address whether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology.\nIn May 2016, Entergy Services filed a request for rehearing of the FERC’s April 2016 order arguing that payments made by Entergy Arkansas should be reduced as a result of the timing of the LPSC’s approval of certain contracts.  Entergy Services also filed a request for clarification and/or rehearing of the FERC’s April 2016 order addressing the ALJ’s August 2013 initial decision.  The APSC and the LPSC also filed requests for rehearing of the FERC’s April 2016 order. \n \nIn September 2017 the FERC issued an order denying the request for rehearing on the issue of whether any payments by Entergy Arkansas to the other Utility operating companies should be reduced due to the timing of the LPSC’s approval of Entergy Arkansas’s wholesale baseload contract with Entergy Louisiana.  In November 2017 the FERC issued an order denying all of the remaining requests for rehearing of the April 2016 order.  In November 2017, Entergy Services filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit of the FERC’s orders in the first two phases of the opportunity sales case.  In December 2017 the D.C. Circuit granted Entergy Services’ request to hold the appeal in abeyance pending final resolution of the related proceeding before the FERC.  In January 2018 the APSC and the LPSC filed separate petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit consolidated the appeals with Entergy Services’ appeal.\n331\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nThe hearing required by the FERC’s April 2016 order was held in May 2017.  In July 2017 the ALJ issued an initial decision addressing whether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and whether to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology.  In August 2017 the Utility operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, and FERC staff filed individual briefs on exceptions challenging various aspects of the initial decision.  In September 2017 the Utility operating companies, the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, the City Council, and FERC staff filed separate briefs opposing exceptions taken by various parties.\nBased on testimony previously submitted in the case and its assessment of the April 2016 FERC orders, in the first quarter 2016, Entergy Arkansas recorded a liability of $87 million, which included interest, for its estimated increased costs and payment to the other Utility operating companies, and a deferred fuel regulatory asset of $75 million.  Following its assessment of the course of the proceedings, including the FERC’s denial of rehearing in November 2017 described above, in the fourth quarter 2017, Entergy Arkansas recorded an additional liability of $35 million and a regulatory asset of $31 million.\nIn October 2018 the FERC issued an order addressing the ALJ’s July 2017 initial decision.  The FERC reversed the ALJ’s decision to cap the reduction in Entergy Arkansas’s payment to account for the increased bandwidth payments that Entergy Arkansas made to the other operating companies.  The FERC also reversed the ALJ’s decision that Grand Gulf sales from January through September 2000 should be included in the calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s payment.  The FERC affirmed on other grounds the ALJ’s rejection of the LPSC’s claim that certain joint account sales should be accounted for as part of the calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s payment.  In November 2018 the LPSC requested rehearing of the FERC’s October 2018 decision.  In December 2019 the FERC denied the LPSC’s request for rehearing.  In January 2020 the LPSC appealed the December 2019 decision to the D.C. Circuit.\nIn December 2018, Entergy made a compliance filing in response to the FERC’s October 2018 order.  The compliance filing provided a final calculation of Entergy Arkansas’s payments to the other Utility operating companies, including interest.  No protests were filed in response to the December 2018 compliance filing.  Refunds and interest in the following amounts were paid by Entergy Arkansas to the other operating companies in December 2018:\n \nTotal refunds including interest\nPayment/(Receipt)\n \n(In Millions)\nPrincipal\nInterest\nTotal\nEntergy Arkansas\n$68\n$67\n$135\nEntergy Louisiana\n($30)\n($29)\n($59)\nEntergy Mississippi\n($18)\n($18)\n($36)\nEntergy New Orleans\n($3)\n($4)\n($7)\nEntergy Texas\n($17)\n($16)\n($33)\nEntergy Arkansas previously recognized a regulatory asset with a balance of $116 million as of December 31, 2018 for a portion of the payments due as a result of this proceeding.\nAs described above, the FERC’s opportunity sales orders were appealed to the D.C. Circuit.  In February 2020 all of the appeals were consolidated and in April 2020 the D.C. Circuit established a briefing schedule.  Briefing was completed in September 2020 and oral argument was heard in December 2020.  In July 2021 the D.C. Circuit issued a decision denying all of the petitions for review filed in response to the FERC’s opportunity sales orders.\nIn February 2019 the LPSC filed a new complaint relating to two issues that were raised in the opportunity sales proceeding, but that, in its October 2018 order, the FERC held were outside the scope of the proceeding.  In \n332\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nMarch 2019, Entergy Services filed an answer and motion to dismiss the new complaint.  In November 2019 the FERC issued an order denying the LPSC’s complaint.  The order concluded that the settlement agreement approved by the FERC in December 2015 terminating the System Agreement barred the LPSC’s new complaint.  In December 2019 the LPSC requested rehearing of the FERC’s November 2019 order, and in July 2020 the FERC issued an order dismissing the LPSC’s request for rehearing.  In September 2020 the LPSC appealed to the D.C. Circuit the FERC’s orders dismissing the new opportunity sales complaint.  In November 2020 the D.C. Circuit issued an order establishing that briefing will occur in January 2021 through April 2021.  Oral argument was held in September 2021.  In December 2021 the D.C. Circuit denied the LPSC’s Petition for Review of the new opportunity sales complaint.  The opportunity sales cases are complete at FERC and at the D.C. Circuit and no additional refund amounts are owed by Entergy Arkansas.\nIn May 2019, Entergy Arkansas filed an application and supporting testimony with the APSC requesting approval of a special rider tariff to recover the costs of these payments from its retail customers over a 24-month period.  The application requested that the APSC approve the rider to take effect within 30 days or, if suspended by the APSC as allowed by commission rule, approve the rider to take effect in the first billing cycle of the first month occurring 30 days after issuance of the APSC’s order approving the rider.  In June 2019 the APSC suspended Entergy Arkansas’s tariff and granted Entergy Arkansas’s motion asking the APSC to establish the proceeding as the single designated proceeding in which interested parties may assert claims related to the appropriate retail rate treatment of the FERC’s October 2018 order and related FERC orders in the opportunity sales proceeding.  In January 2020 the APSC adopted a procedural schedule with a hearing in April 2020.  In January 2020 the Attorney General and Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed a joint motion seeking to dismiss Entergy Arkansas’s application alleging that the APSC, in a prior proceeding, ruled on the issues addressed in the application and determined that Entergy Arkansas’s requested relief violates the filed rate doctrine and the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking.  Entergy Arkansas responded to the joint motion in February 2020 rebutting these arguments, including demonstrating that the claims in this proceeding differ substantially from those the APSC addressed previously and that the payment resulting from a FERC tariff violation for which Entergy Arkansas seeks retail cost recovery in this proceeding differs materially from the refunds resulting from a FERC tariff amendment that the APSC previously rejected on filed rate doctrine and the retroactive ratemaking grounds.  In addition, in January 2020 the Attorney General and Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed testimony opposing the recovery by Entergy Arkansas of the opportunity sales payment but also claiming that certain components of the payment should be segregated and refunded to customers.  In March 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed rebuttal testimony.\nIn July 2020 the APSC issued a decision finding that Entergy Arkansas’s application is not in the public interest.  The order also directed Entergy Arkansas to refund to its retail customers within 30 days of the order the FERC-determined over-collection of $13.7 million, plus interest, associated with a recalculated bandwidth remedy.  In addition to these primary findings, the order also denied the Attorney General’s request for Entergy Arkansas to prepare a compliance filing detailing all of the retail impacts from the opportunity sales and denied a request by the Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers to recalculate all costs using the revised responsibility ratio.  Entergy Arkansas filed a motion for temporary stay of the 30-day requirement to allow Entergy Arkansas a reasonable opportunity to seek rehearing of the APSC order, but in July 2020 the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas’s request for a stay and directed Entergy Arkansas to refund to its retail customers the component of the total FERC-determined opportunity sales payment that was associated with increased bandwidth remedy payments of $13.7 million, plus interest.  The refunds were issued in the August 2020 billing cycle.  While the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas’s stay request, Entergy Arkansas believes its actions were prudent and, therefore, the costs, including the $13.7 million, plus interest, are recoverable.  In July 2020, Entergy Arkansas requested rehearing of the APSC order, which rehearing was denied by the APSC in August 2020.  In September 2020, Entergy Arkansas filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas challenging the APSC’s order denying Entergy Arkansas’s request to recover the costs of these payments.  In October 2020 the APSC filed a motion to dismiss Entergy Arkansas’s complaint, to which Entergy Arkansas responded.  Also in December 2020, Entergy Arkansas and the APSC held a pre-trial conference, and filed a report with the court in January 2021.  The court held a hearing in February 2021 regarding issues addressed in the pre-trial conference report, and in June 2021 the \n333\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\ncourt stayed all discovery until it rules on pending motions, after which the court will issue an amended schedule if necessary. \n \nIn March 2022 the court denied the APSC’s motion to dismiss, and, in April 2022, issued a scheduling order including a trial date in February 2023.  In June 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion asserting that it is entitled to summary judgment because Entergy Arkansas’s position that the APSC’s order is pre-empted by the filed rate doctrine and violates the Dormant Commerce Clause is premised on facts that are not subject to genuine dispute.  In July 2022, Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc., an industrial customer association, filed a motion to intervene and to hold Entergy Arkansas’s motion for summary judgment in abeyance pending a ruling on the motion to intervene.  Entergy Arkansas filed a consolidated opposition to both motions.  In August 2022 the APSC filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the APSC is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  In September 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed an opposition to the motion.  In October 2022 the APSC filed a motion asking the court to hold further proceedings in abeyance pending a decision on the motions for summary judgment filed by Entergy Arkansas and the APSC.  Also in October 2022, Entergy Arkansas filed an opposition to the motion, and the APSC filed a reply in support of its motion for summary judgment.  In January 2023 the judge assigned to the case, on her own motion, identified facts that may present a conflict and recused herself; a new judge was assigned to the case, but he also recused due to a conflict.  The case again was reassigned to a new judge.  In January 2023 the court denied all pending motions (including those described above) except for a motion by the APSC to exclude certain testimony and further ruled that the matter would proceed to trial.  In January 2023, Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed a notice of appeal of the court’s order denying its motion to intervene to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and a motion with the district court to stay the proceedings pending the appeal, which was denied.  In February 2023, Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc. filed a motion with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to stay the proceedings pending the appeal, which also was denied.  The trial was held in February 2023.  Following the trial, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to expedite the appeal filed by Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted Entergy Arkansas’s request, and oral arguments were held in June 2023.  In August 2023 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the order of the court denying Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers, Inc.’s motion to intervene.\nIn March 2024 the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas issued a judgment in favor of the APSC and against Entergy Arkansas.  In March 2024 Entergy Arkansas filed a notice of appeal and a motion to expedite oral arguments with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and the court granted the motion to expedite.  Briefing to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit concluded in July 2024 and oral arguments concluded in September 2024.  As a result of the adverse decision by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Entergy Arkansas concluded that it could no longer support the recognition of its $131.8 million regulatory asset reflecting the previously-expected recovery of a portion of the costs at issue in the opportunity sales proceeding and recorded a $131.8 million ($99.1 million net-of-tax) charge to earnings in first quarter 2024.  In December 2024 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the decision of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, and Entergy Arkansas filed a petition for rehearing \nen banc\n.  In January 2025 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied Entergy Arkansas’s petition.  Entergy Arkansas is evaluating a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.\nNet Metering Legislation\nAfter the passage of an Arkansas net metering law that was enacted effective July 2019, the APSC approved numerous applications allowing Entergy Arkansas customers to enter into purchase power agreements with third parties and to utilize these purchase power agreements to offset power usage by Entergy Arkansas, despite the lack of proximity between the purchase power agreement and the end-use customer.  The APSC also allowed the aggregation of accounts by net metering customers.  These decisions by the APSC created subsidies in favor of eligible net metering customers to the detriment of non-participating customers.  The level of this subsidy grew as additional net metering applications were approved by the APSC.  The size and number of customers eligible under the 2019 law present a risk of loss of load and shifting of costs to customers.\n334\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nAnother Arkansas law was enacted effective March 2023 that revised the billing arrangements for net metering facilities in order to reduce the cost shift to non-net metering customers.  The new law also imposes a new limit of 5 MW for future net metering facilities, allows utilities to recover net metering credits in the same manner as fuel, and grandfathers certain net metering facilities that are online or in process to be online by September 2024.  As of October 2024, new net metering facilities are subject to two-channel billing.  Because of the new law, in May 2023, the APSC closed its prior cost-shifting proceeding and grandfathering rulemaking relating to the prior net metering rate structure.  Under the new law, the APSC had to approve revisions to utilities’ net metering tariffs to conform to the new law no later than December 2023.  The APSC opened a new rulemaking in April 2023 to consider implementation of the new law and tariffs.  In October 2023 the APSC issued new net metering rules to conform to the new law, and utilities, including Entergy Arkansas, filed revised net metering tariffs to comply with the new rules on October 16, 2023.  Entergy Arkansas’s revised net metering tariff was approved by the APSC in December 2023.\nFederal Regulation\nSee the “\nRate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation\n \n– Federal Regulation\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation.\nNuclear Matters\nEntergy Arkansas owns and, through an affiliate, operates the ANO 1 and 2 nuclear generating plants and is, therefore, subject to the risks related to such ownership and operation.  These include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues related to equipment reliability, to position Entergy Arkansas’s nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license amendments, and decommissioning; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts of insurance recoveries for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident.  In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ANO 1 or 2, Entergy Arkansas may be required to file with the APSC a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.  ANO 1’s operating license expires in 2034 and ANO 2’s operating license expires in 2038.\nEnvironmental Risks\nEntergy Arkansas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy Arkansas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “\nRegulation of Entergy’s Business\n - \nEnvironmental Regulation\n” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree \n335\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nof uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in these assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNuclear Decommissioning Costs\nSee “\nNuclear Decommissioning Costs\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\nSee “\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation.\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\nSee “\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nEntergy Arkansas’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are affected by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.   See “\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.\nCost Sensitivity\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Qualified Pension Cost\nImpact on 2024 Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$684\n$23,229\nRate of return on plan assets\n(0.25%)\n$2,591\n$—\nRate of increase in compensation\n0.25%\n$957\n$4,945\n336\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefits cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Postretirement Benefits Cost\nImpact on 2024 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$140\n$3,257\nHealth care cost trend\n0.25%\n$393\n$2,080\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.\nCosts and Employer Contributions\nTotal qualified pension cost for Entergy Arkansas in 2024 was $19.6 million.  Entergy Arkansas anticipates 2025 qualified pension cost to be $21.4 million.  Entergy Arkansas contributed $55.1 million to its qualified pension plans in 2024 and estimates pension contributions will be approximately $35.5 million in 2025, although the 2025 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2025 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2025.\nTotal postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy Arkansas in 2024 was $5.5 million.  Entergy Arkansas expects 2025 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $6.8 million.  In 2024, Entergy Arkansas’ contributions to its other postretirement plans, specifically contributions to the external trusts plus claims payments, were offset by trust claims reimbursements, resulting in a net reimbursement of $604 thousand.  Entergy Arkansas\n \nestimates that 2025 contributions will be approximately $529 thousand.\nOther Contingencies\nSee “\nOther Contingencies\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the estimates associated with environmental, litigation, and other risks.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee the “\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n” section of Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\n337\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the member and Board of Directors of\nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in equity (pages \n340\n through \n344\n and applicable items in pages \n47\n through 239), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRate and Regulatory Matters\n — \nEntergy Arkansas, LLC and Subsidiaries\n — \nRefer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Arkansas Public Service Commission (the “APSC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric companies in Arkansas, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n338\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight.  Because the APSC and the FERC set the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities.  The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the APSC and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers. Auditing management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the APSC and the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the APSC and the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the APSC and the FERC for the Company to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the APSC’s and the FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the APSC and the FERC and orders issued, and considered the filings with the APSC and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions\n.\n•\nWe obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or refund or a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nFebruary 18, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001.\n339\nTable of Contents\nENTERGY ARKANSAS, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In Thousands)\nOPERATING REVENUES\n \n \n \nElectric\n$\n2,460,181\n \n$\n2,646,396\n \n$\n2,673,194\n \nOPERATING EXPENSES\n \n \n \nOperation and Maintenance:\n \n \n \nFuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale\n274,282\n \n514,885\n \n640,344\n \nPurchased power\n239,281\n \n257,890\n \n201,726\n \nNuclear refueling outage expenses\n51,840\n \n59,973\n \n53,438\n \nOther operation and maintenance\n742,573\n \n737,649\n \n754,293\n \nAsset write-offs\n131,775\n \n78,434\n \n—\n \nDecommissioning\n93,582\n \n87,321\n \n82,326\n \nTaxes other than income taxes\n141,225\n \n141,502\n \n136,565\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n422,767\n \n400,944\n \n386,272\n \nOther regulatory charges (credits) -

See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the agreement in principle\n and the subsequently filed global stipulated settlement agreement\n;\n•\na $179.1 million reduction in income tax expense in 2023 as a result of the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit, partially offset by a $38 million regulatory charge ($27.8 million net-of-tax) to reflect credits expected to be provided to customers as a result of the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit;\n•\nthe reversal of a $105.6 million regulatory liability, primarily associated with the Hurricane Isaac securitization, recognized in 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, recorded in fourth quarter 2023, as part of the settlement of Entergy Louisiana’s test year 2017 formula rate plan filing.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;\n•\nthe net effects of Entergy Louisiana’s storm cost securitization in March 2023, including a $133.4 million reduction in income tax expense, partially offset by a $103.4 million ($76.4 million net-of-tax) regulatory charge to reflect Entergy Louisiana’s obligation to provide credits to its customers as described in an LPSC ancillary order issued as part of the securitization regulatory proceeding.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the March 2023 storm cost securitization;\n•\nhigher depreciation and amortization expenses; and\n•\nhigher interest expense.\nThe decrease was partially offset by higher other income, higher retail electric price, and higher volume/weather.\nOperating Revenues\nFollowing is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2024 to 2023:\n \nAmount\n \n(In Millions)\n2023 operating revenues\n$5,147.8 \nFuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income\n(80.2)\nStorm restoration carrying costs\n(30.6)\nVolume/weather\n52.0 \nRetail electric price\n55.0 \n2024 operating revenues\n$5,144.0\n \n345\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nEntergy Louisiana’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income.  “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.\nStorm \nrestoration carrying costs\n represent the equity component of storm restoration carrying costs recognized as part of the securitization of Hurricane Ida restoration costs in March 2023.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the March 2023 storm cost securitization.\nThe volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in industrial usage driven by an increase in demand from large industrial customers, primarily in the petroleum refining and chlor-alkali industries.  In addition, there was an increase in commercial usage and an increase in weather-adjusted residential usage, partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales.  The increase in weather-adjusted residential usage is the result of higher fixed charges, partially offset by lower volumetric rates, applied to lower usage.\nThe retail electric price variance is primarily due to increases in formula rate plan revenues, including increases in the distribution and transmission recovery mechanisms, effective September 2023 and September 2024.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the formula rate plan proceedings.\nTotal electric energy sales for Entergy Louisiana for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n(GWh)\nResidential\n14,000 \n14,207 \n(1)\nCommercial\n11,108 \n11,074 \n— \nIndustrial\n34,759 \n31,599 \n10 \nGovernmental\n836 \n801 \n4 \n  Total retail  \n60,703 \n57,681 \n5 \nSales for resale:\n  Associated companies\n5,808 \n4,406 \n32 \n  Non-associated companies\n1,574 \n1,534 \n3 \nTotal\n68,085 \n63,621 \n7 \nSee Note 19 to the financial statements for additional discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s operating revenues.\nOther Income Statement Variances\nOther operation and maintenance expenses remained relatively unchanged primarily due to the following activity:\n•\nan increase of $13.6 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher healthcare claims activity, including lower prescription drug rebates in 2024 as compared to 2023, and higher incentive-based accruals in 2024 as compared to 2023;\n•\nan increase of $7.9 million in transmission costs allocated by MISO.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the recovery of these costs;\n•\nan increase of $7 million in loss provisions;\n•\nan increase of $4.4 million in energy efficiency expenses primarily due to higher energy efficiency costs;\n•\na decrease of $4.5 million in customer service center support costs primarily due to lower contract costs;\n346\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\n•\na decrease of $5.6 million in information technology costs primarily due to enhancements made in 2023 to certain information technology systems; and\n•\na decrease of $13.8 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to lower vegetation maintenance costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service and an increase in nuclear depreciation rates effective September 2024 in accordance with the global stipulated settlement agreement approved by the LPSC in August 2024.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the global stipulated settlement agreement.\nOther regulatory charges (credits) - net includes:\n•\nregulatory charges of $150.2 million, recorded in second quarter 2024, to reflect the effects of an agreement in principle between Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff and the intervenors in July 2024 to renew Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan and resolve a number of other retail dockets and matters, including all formula rate plan test years prior to 2023.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the agreement in principle\n and the subsequently filed global stipulated settlement agreement;\n•\na regulatory charge of $103.4 million, recorded in first quarter 2023, to reflect Entergy Louisiana’s obligation to provide credits to its customers \nas described in an LPSC ancillary order iss\nued in the Hurricane Ida securitization regulatory proceeding.  See Note 2 to the financial statements \nfor discussion of the March 2023 storm cost securitization; and\n•\na regulatory charge of $38 million, recorded in fourth quarter 2023, to reflect credits expected to be provided to customers as a result of the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the resolution of the 2016-2018 IRS audit.\nIn addition, Entergy Louisiana records a regulatory charge or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and nuclear decommissioning trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue.\nOther income increased primarily due to:\n•\nchanges in decommissioning trust fund activity, including portfolio rebalancing of decommissioning trust funds in 2024;\n•\na decrease of $27.4 million in non-service pension costs primarily as a result of pension settlement charges recorded in 2023 and a reduction in 2024 in the amortization of deferred pension losses as a result of an amendment to a qualified pension plan spinning-off predominantly inactive participants into a new qualified plan, extending the amortization period for deferred losses.

The increase in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Louisiana is primarily due to the net issuance of long-term debt in 2024.\n \nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nDebt to capital\n46.0 \n%\n44.9 \n%\nEffect of subtracting cash\n(0.8 \n%)\n0.0 \n%\nNet debt to net capital (non-GAAP)\n45.2 \n%\n44.9 \n%\nNet debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion.  Capital consists of debt and equity.  Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.  Entergy Louisiana uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana’s financial condition.  The net debt to net capital ratio is a non-GAAP measure.  Entergy Louisiana also uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Louisiana’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nEntergy Louisiana seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings.  To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.  To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Louisiana may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure.  In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reduced distributions, Entergy Louisiana may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure.\nUses of Capital\nEntergy Louisiana requires capital resources for:\n•\nconstruction and other capital investments;\n•\ndebt maturities or retirements;\n•\nworking capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and\n•\ndistribution and interest payments.\n351\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana’s planned construction and other capital investments.\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n \n(In Millions)\nPlanned construction and capital investment:\n \n \nGeneration\n$1,635 \n$1,975 \n$2,570 \nTransmission\n945 \n1,435 \n1,270 \nDistribution\n1,140 \n1,100 \n685 \nUtility Support\n110 \n105 \n210 \nTotal\n$3,830 \n$4,615 \n$4,735 \nIn addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Louisiana includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, expand, and diversify Entergy Louisiana’s portfolio, as well as to support customer growth, including St. Jacques Facility, Sterlington facility, Bayou Power S\ntation, and new generation resources in north Louisiana; inve\nstments in River Bend and Waterford 3; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to improve reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion and customer growth; and other investments.  Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, governmental actions, including trade-related governmental actions, such as tariffs and other measures, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital, including any changes to governmental programs, such as loans, grants, guarantees, and other subsidies.  Entergy Louisiana is not able to predict the effect of potential changes in regulation and law, changes to governmental programs, such as loans, grants, guarantees, and other subsidies, and trade-related governmental actions, such as tariffs and other measures, on its current and planned capital projects.\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments).\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028-2029\nAfter 2029\n \n(In Millions)\nLong-term debt (a)\n$686 \n$1,088 \n$909 \n$1,081 \n$12,568 \nOperating leases (b)\n$20 \n$18 \n$15 \n$18 \n$4 \nFinance leases (b)\n$7 \n$6 \n$5 \n$7 \n$5 \n(a)\nLong-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n(b)\nLease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.\nOther Obligations\nEntergy Louisiana currently expects to contribute approximately $41.3 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $14.4 million to its other postretirement plans in 2025, although the 2025 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2025, valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2025.  See “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \n- \nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.\nEntergy Louisiana has $114 million of unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes plus interest for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.\n352\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nIn addition, Entergy Louisiana enters into fuel and purchased power agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations.  Entergy Louisiana has rate mechanisms in place to recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs incurred under these purchase obligations.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s obligations under and divestiture from the Unit Power Sales Agreement and its obligations under the Vidalia purchased power agreement.\nAs a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly.\n2021 Solar Certification and the Geaux Green Option\nIn November 2021, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking certification of and approval for the addition of four new solar photovoltaic resources with a combined nameplate capacity of 475 megawatts (the 2021 Solar Portfolio) and the implementation of a new green tariff, the Geaux Green Option (Rider GGO).  The 2021 Solar Portfolio consists of four resources that are expected to provide $242 million in net benefits to Entergy Louisiana’s customers.  These resources, all of which would be constructed in Louisiana, include (i) the Vacherie Facility, a 150 megawatt resource in St. James Parish; (ii) the Sunlight Road Facility, a 50 megawatt resource in Washington Parish; (iii) the St. Jacques Facility, a 150 megawatt resource in St. James Parish; and (iv) the Elizabeth Facility, a 125 megawatt resource in Allen Parish.  The St. Jacques Facility would be acquired through a build-own-transfer agreement; the remaining resources involve power purchase agreements.  The Sunlight Road Facility and the Elizabeth Facility each achieved commercial operation in 2024, and the Vacherie Facility and the St. Jacques Facility originally had estimated in service dates in 2025, but are now expected to be no sooner than 2027.  The filing proposed to recover the costs of the power purchase agreements through the fuel adjustment clause and the formula rate plan and the acquisition costs through the formula rate plan.\nThe proposed Rider GGO is a voluntary rate schedule that will enhance Entergy Louisiana’s ability to help customers meet their sustainability goals by allowing customers to align some or all of their electricity requirements with renewable energy from the resources.  Because subscription fees from Rider GGO participants are expected to help offset the cost of the resources, the design of Rider GGO also preserves the benefits of the 2021 Solar Portfolio for non-participants by providing them with the reliability and capacity benefits of locally-sited solar generation at a discounted price.\nIn March 2022 direct testimony from Walmart, the Louisiana Energy Users Group (LEUG), and the LPSC staff was filed.  Each party recommended that the LPSC approve the resources proposed in Entergy Louisiana’s application, and the LPSC staff witness indicated that the process through which Entergy Louisiana solicited or obtained the proposals for the resources complied with applicable LPSC orders.  The LPSC staff and LEUG’s witnesses made recommendations to modify the proposed Rider GGO and Entergy Louisiana’s proposed rate relief.  In April 2022 the LPSC staff and LEUG filed cross-answering testimony concerning each other’s proposed modifications to Rider GGO and the proposed rate recovery.  Entergy Louisiana filed rebuttal testimony in June 2022.  In August 2022 the parties reached a settlement certifying the 2021 Solar Portfolio and approving implementation of Rider GGO.  In September 2022 the LPSC approved the settlement.  Following the LPSC approval, the St. James Parish council issued a moratorium on new land use permits for solar facilities until the later of March 2023 or the completion of an environmental and economic impact study.  In November 2023, St. James Parish lifted the moratorium and adopted an ordinance modifying the parish’s land use plan to establish solar as an approved land use and defining corresponding solar regulations.  In March 2024 the project developer submitted a solar energy facility farm permit application to the St. James Parish planning commission to request approval for the Vacherie and St. Jacques Facilities.  In June 2024 the St. James Parish council denied the application and following this denial, the project developer and one of the project’s ground lessors filed separate lawsuits seeking to overturn the council’s decision.  Entergy Louisiana is currently monitoring the status of the aforementioned lawsuits and also considering alternate paths forward.\n353\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\n2022 Solar Portfolio and Expansion of the Geaux Green Option\nIn February 2023, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking certification of the Iberville/Coastal Prairie facility, which will provide 175 MW of capacity through a PPA with a third party, and the Sterlington facility, a 49 MW self-build project located near the deactivated Sterlington power plant (the 2022 Solar Portfolio).  Entergy Louisiana is seeking to include these resources within the portfolio supporting the Rider GGO rate schedule to help fulfill customer interest in access to renewable energy.  Entergy Louisiana has requested the costs of these facilities, as offset by Rider GGO revenues, be deemed eligible for recovery in accordance with the terms of the formula rate plan and fuel adjustment clause rate mechanisms that exist at the time the facilities are placed into service.  In January 2024, the parties filed an uncontested stipulated settlement agreement on the key issues in the case, which stated that the 2022 Solar Portfolio should be constructed, found that Entergy Louisiana’s proposed cost recovery mechanisms were appropriate, and confirmed the resources’ eligibility for inclusion in Rider GGO.  The settlement was approved by the LPSC in January 2024.  The Sterlington facility is expected to achieve commercial operation in January 2026.\nAlternative RFP and Certification\nIn 2023, Entergy Louisiana made a filing to seek approval from the LPSC for an alternative to the requests for proposals (RFP) process that would enable the acquisition of up to 3 GW of solar resources on a faster timeline than the current RFP and certification process allows.  The initial phase of the filing established the need for the acquisition of additional resources and the need for an alternative to the RFP process.  The second phase of the filing contained the details of the proposal for the alternative competitive procurement process and the information necessary to support certification.  In addition to the acquisition of up to 3 GW of solar resources, the filing also sought approval of a new renewable energy credits-based tariff, the Geaux ZERO rider\n. \n In June 2024 the LPSC issued an order approving the application.  In August 2024, Entergy Louisiana issued the first RFP pursuant to this order in solicitation of solar resources that meet the requirements of the LPSC’s order.  For the first RFP, the initial selection of proposals has been completed, and negotiations are in progress.\nBayou Power Station\nIn March 2024, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking certification that the public convenience and necessity would be served by the construction of the Bayou Power Station, a 112 MW aggregated capacity floating natural gas power station with black-start capability in Leeville, Louisiana and an associated microgrid that would serve nearby areas, including Port Fourchon, Golden Meadow, Leeville, and Grand Isle.  In its application, Entergy Louisiana noted that the estimated cost of the Bayou Power Station was $411 million, including estimated costs of transmission interconnection and other related costs.  In October 2024, Entergy Louisiana filed a motion to suspend the procedural schedule in this proceeding in order to evaluate certain recent developments related to the project including potential changes to the estimated cost of the project.  Entergy Louisiana will determine next steps for the project after fully evaluating these developments.  Subject to timely approval by the LPSC and receipt of other permits and approvals, commercial operation is expected to occur by the end of 2028.\nAdditional Generation and Transmission Resources\nIn October 2024, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking approval of a variety of generation and transmission resources proposed in connection with establishing service to a new data center to be developed by a subsidiary of Meta Platforms, Inc. in north Louisiana, for which an electric service agreement has been executed.  The filing requests LPSC certification of three new combined cycle combustion turbine generation resources totaling 2,262 MW, each of which will be enabled for future carbon capture and storage, a new 500 kV transmission line, and 500 kV substation upgrades.  The application also requests approval to implement a corporate sustainability rider applicable to the new customer.  The corporate sustainability rider contemplates the new customer contributing to the costs of the planned future addition of 1,500 MW of new solar and energy storage \n354\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nresources, agreements involving carbon capture and storage at Entergy Louisiana’s existing Lake Charles Power Station, and potential future wind and nuclear resources.  The combined cost of the first two new combined cycle combustion turbine generation resources is estimated to be approximately $2,387 million, and these units are expected to achieve commercial operation in 2028.  The third new generation resource is currently expected to have an estimated cost similar to the first two new generation resources and is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2029.  The cost of the new 500 kV transmission line is estimated to be $546 million.  Entergy Louisiana anticipates funding the incremental cost to serve the customer through direct financial contributions from the customer and the revenues it expects to earn under the electric service agree\nment.  The electric service agreement also contains provisions for termination payments that will help ensure that there is no harm to Entergy Louisiana and its customers in the event of early termination.\n \nA directive was issued at the LPSC’s November 2024 meeting for the matter to be decided by October 2025.  Consistent with this directive, a procedural schedule was adopted setting the matter for hearing in July 2025.  In February 2025 intervenors filed a motion asking the LPSC to deny Entergy Louisiana’s requested exemption from the LPSC’s order addressing competitive solicitation procedures and further asking the LPSC to dismiss the application.\nIn February 2025, Entergy Louisiana filed supplemental testimony with the LPSC stating that the third combined cycle combustion turbine resource presented in the October 2024 application would be sited at Entergy Louisiana’s Waterford site in Killona, Louisiana, alongside existing Entergy Louisiana generation resources.  The testimony also notes that Entergy Louisiana is negotiating with the customer to increase the load associated with the customer’s project in north Louisiana and that the additional load can be served without additional generation capacity beyond what was presented in the October 2024 application, but that additional transmission facilities, which will be funded directly by the customer, are needed to serve this additional load\n.\nTransmission Projects\nIn March 2024, Entergy Louisiana filed an application seeking an exemption determination, or alternatively, a certificate of public convenience and necessity, for a transmission project that includes a new 500 kV/230 kV Commodore substation and an approximately 60-mile 230 kV line connecting the new Commodore substation to the Waterford substation.  The project, which was approved by MISO in the 2023 MISO Transmission Expansion Plan, also includes certain common elements with, and right-of-way acquisition for, a future transmission project in the same area consisting of 500 kV elements.  The estimated cost of the project is $498.8 million.  In February 2025, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff jointly filed, for consideration by the LPSC, an uncontested stipulated settlement agreement resolving all issues in the proceeding.  In the motion requesting approval of the uncontested stipulated settlement agreement, the parties requested a settlement hearing in March 2025.\nIn December 2024, Entergy Louisiana filed an application seeking a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a 500 kV transmission project that includes the construction of a new 84-mile Commodore to Churchill 500 kV transmission line, the expansion of the Waterford 500 kV substation, the construction of a new Churchill 500 kV substation and improvements to the Churchill 230 kV substation, and the conversion of the existing 230 kV Waterford to Churchill transmission line to 500 kV, forming a 500 kV loop into the Downstream of Gypsy load pocket.  The project, which was approved by MISO in the 2023 MISO Transmission Expansion Plan, shares common elements with a future transmission project in the same area consisting of 230 kV elements.  The estimated cost of the project is $954.7 million.\nResilience and Grid Hardening\nIn December 2022, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC seeking a public interest finding regarding Phase I of Entergy Louisiana’s Future Ready resilience plan and approval of a rider mechanism to recover the program’s costs.  Phase I in the December 2022 application reflected the first five years of a ten-year resilience plan and included investment of approximately $5 billion, including hardening investment, transmission dead-end structures, enhanced vegetation management, and telecommunications improvement.  In April 2024 the LPSC approved a framework which includes an initial five-year resilience plan providing for an investment of \n355\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\napproximately $1.9 billion with cost recovery via a forward-looking rider with semi-annual true-ups.  The plan is subject to specified reporting requirements and includes a performance review of the hardened assets.  The LPSC order approving the framework does not include any restrictions on Entergy Louisiana’s ability to file applications for approval of additional investments in resilience.\nThe LPSC had previously opened a formal rulemaking proceeding in December 2021 to investigate efforts to improve resilience of electric utility infrastructure.  In April 2023 the LPSC staff issued a draft rule in the rulemaking proceeding related to a requirement to file a grid resilience plan.  The procedural schedule entered in the rulemaking proceeding contemplated adoption of a final rule in October 2023, but this did not occur, and a new date has not been set.  The LPSC also has pending rulemakings addressing issues related to pole viability and grid maintenance practices.  In December 2023, in those rulemakings, the LPSC staff issued a report and recommendation proposing to impose significant new reporting and compliance obligations related to jurisdictional utilities’ distribution and transmission operations, including new obligations related to grid hardening plans, pole inspections, pole replacement, vegetation management, storm restoration plans, new reliability metrics, software for handling customer complaints and complaint resolution, required use of drone technology, and new penalties and incentives for reliability performance and for compliance with the new obligations.  In February 2024, Entergy Louisiana and other parties filed comments on the LPSC staff’s report.\nSources of Capital\nEntergy Louisiana’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:\n•\ninternally generated funds;\n•\ncash on hand;\n•\nthe Entergy system money pool;\n•\nstorm reserve escrow accounts;\n•\ndebt or preferred membership interest issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness;\n•\ncapital contributions; and\n•\nbank financing under new or existing facilities.\nCircumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future.  In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Entergy Louisiana expects to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit.\nAll debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Louisiana require prior regulatory approval.  Debt issuances are also subject to requirements set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements.

The credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $15 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility.  As of December 31, 2024, there were no cash borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility.  In addition, Entergy Louisiana is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO.  As of December 31, 2024, $46.2 million in letters of credit were outstanding under Entergy Louisiana’s uncommitted letter of credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities.\nThe Entergy Louisiana nuclear fuel company variable interest entities have two separate credit facilities, each in the amount of $105 million and scheduled to expire in June 2027.  As of December 31, 2024, $18.7 million in loans were outstanding under the credit facility for the Entergy Louisiana River Bend nuclear fuel company variable interest entity.  As of December 31, 2024, $18.9 million in loans were outstanding under the Entergy Louisiana Waterford nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facilities.\nEntergy Louisiana obtained authorizations from the FERC through January 2027 for the following:\n•\nshort-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $450 million at any time outstanding;\n•\nlong-term borrowings and security issuances; and\n•\nborrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entities.\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s short-term borrowing limits.\nHurricane Francine\nIn September 2024, Hurricane Francine caused damage to the areas served by Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans.  The storm resulted in widespread power outages, primarily due to damage to distribution infrastructure as a result of strong winds and heavy rain, and the loss of sales during the power outages.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the December 2024 storm cost recovery filing related to Hurricane Francine.\nState and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery\nThe rates that Entergy Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy Louisiana is regulated, and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings.  A governmental agency, the LPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.\nRetail Rates - Electric\nFilings with the LPSC\n2020 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn June 2021, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2020 calendar year operations.  The 2020 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of 8.45%, with a base formula rate plan revenue increase of $63 million.  Certain reductions in formula rate plan revenue driven by lower sales volumes, reductions in capacity cost and net MISO cost, and higher credits resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act offset the base formula rate plan revenue increase, leading to a net increase in formula rate plan revenue of $50.7 million.  The report also included multiple new adjustments to account for, among other things, the calculation of distribution recovery mechanism revenues.  The effects of the changes to total formula rate plan revenue were different for each legacy company, primarily due to differences in the legacy companies’ capacity cost \n357\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nchanges, including the effect of true-ups.  Legacy Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $27 million and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $23.7 million.  Subject to LPSC review, the resulting changes became effective for bills rendered during the first billing cycle of September 2021, subject to refund.  Discovery commenced in the proceeding.  In August 2021, Entergy Louisiana submitted an update to its evaluation report to account for various changes.  Relative to the June 2021 filing, the total formula rate plan revenue increased by $14.2 million to an updated total of $64.9 million.  Legacy Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $32.8 million and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $32.1 million.  The results of the 2020 test year evaluation report bandwidth calculation were unchanged as there was no change in the earned return on common equity of 8.45%.  In September 2021 the LPSC staff filed a letter with a general statement of objections/reservations because it had not completed its review and indicated it would update the letter once its review was complete.\nIn November 2023 the LPSC approved a global settlement which resolved all outstanding issues related to the 2017, 2018, and 2019 formula rate plan filings and resolved certain issues with respect to the 2020 and 2021 formula rate plan filings.  See “Formula Rate Plan Global Settlement” below for further discussion of the settlement.  In September 2024 the LPSC issued an order approving a settlement that resolved, with prejudice, all other issues identified by the staff in the matter and closed the docket.  See “2023 Entergy Louisiana Rate Case and Formula Rate Plan Extension Request” below for further discussion.\n2021 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn May 2022, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2021 calendar year operations.  The 2021 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of 8.33%, with a base formula rate plan revenue increase of $65.3 million.  Other increases in formula rate plan revenue driven by reductions in Tax Cut and Jobs Act credits and additions to transmission and distribution plant in service reflected through the transmission recovery mechanism and distribution recovery mechanism are partly offset by an increase in net MISO revenues, leading to a net increase in formula rate plan revenue of $152.9 million.  The effects of the changes to total formula rate plan revenue are different for each legacy company, primarily due to differences in the legacy companies’ capacity cost changes, including the effect of true-ups.  Legacy Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $86 million and legacy Entergy Gulf States Louisiana formula rate plan revenues increased by $66.9 million.  In August 2022 the LPSC staff filed a list of objections/reservations, including outstanding issues from the test years 2017-2020 formula rate plan filings, utilizing the extraordinary cost mechanism to address one-time changes such as state tax rate changes, and failing to include an adjustment for revenues not received as a result of Hurricane Ida.  Subject to LPSC review, the resulting changes to formula rate plan revenues became effective for bills rendered during the first billing cycle of September 2022, subject to refund.\nIn November 2023 the LPSC approved a global settlement which resolved all outstanding issues related to the 2017, 2018, and 2019 formula rate plan filings and resolved certain issues with respect to the 2020 and 2021 formula rate plan filings.  See “Formula Rate Plan Global Settlement” below for further discussion of the settlement.  In September 2024 the LPSC issued an order approving a settlement that resolved, with prejudice, all other issues identified by the staff in the matter and closed the docket.  See “2023 Entergy Louisiana Rate Case and Formula Rate Plan Extension Request” below for further discussion.\n2022 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn May 2023, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2022 calendar year operations.  The 2022 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of 8.33%, requiring an approximately $70.7 million increase to base rider revenue.  Due to a cap for the 2021 and 2022 test years, however, base rider formula rate plan revenues were only increased by approximately $4.9 million, resulting in a revenue deficiency of approximately $65.9 million and providing for prospective return on common equity opportunity of approximately 8.38%.  Other changes in formula rate plan revenue driven by increases in capacity costs, primarily legacy capacity costs, additions eligible for recovery through the transmission recovery mechanism \n358\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nand distribution recovery mechanism, and higher sales during the test period were offset by reductions in net MISO costs as well as credits for FERC-ordered refunds.  Also included in the 2022 test year distribution recovery mechanism revenue requirement was a $6 million credit relating to the distribution recovery mechanism performance accountability standards and requirements.  In total, the net increase in formula rate plan revenues, including base formula rate plan revenues inside the formula rate plan bandwidth and subject to the cap, as well as other formula rate plan revenues outside of the bandwidth, was $85.2 million.  In August 2023 the LPSC staff filed a list of objections/reservations, including outstanding issues from the test years 2017-2021 formula rate plan filings, the calculation of certain refunds from System Energy, and certain calculations relating to the tax reform adjustment mechanism.  Subject to LPSC review, the resulting net increase in formula rate plan revenues of $85.2 million became effective for bills rendered during the first billing cycle of September 2023, subject to refund.  In September 2024 the LPSC issued an order approving a settlement that resolved, with prejudice, all other issues identified by the staff in the matter and closed the docket.  See “2023 Entergy Louisiana Rate Case and Formula Rate Plan Extension Request” below for further discussion.\n2023 Entergy Louisiana Rate Case and Formula Rate Plan Extension Request\nIn August 2023, Entergy Louisiana filed an application for approval of a regulatory blueprint necessary for it to strengthen the electric grid for the State of Louisiana, which contained a dual-path request to update rates through either: (1) extension of Entergy Louisiana’s current formula rate plan (with certain modifications) for three years (the Rate Mitigation Proposal), which is Entergy Louisiana’s recommended path; or (2) implementation of rates resulting from a cost-of-service study (the Rate Case path).  The application complied with Entergy Louisiana’s previous formula rate plan extension order requiring that for Entergy Louisiana to obtain another extension of its formula rate plan that included a rate reset, Entergy Louisiana would need to submit a full cost-of-service rate case.  Entergy Louisiana’s filing supported the need to extend Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan with credit supportive mechanisms needed to facilitate investment in the distribution, transmission, and generation functions.\nIn July 2024, Entergy Louisiana reached an agreement in principle with the LPSC staff and the intervenors in the proceeding and filed with the LPSC a joint motion to suspend the procedural schedule to allow for all parties to finalize a stipulated settlement agreement.\nIn August 2024, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff jointly filed a global stipulated settlement agreement for consideration by the LPSC with key terms as follows:\n•\ncontinuation of the formula rate plan for 2024-2026 (test years 2023-2025);\n•\na base formula rate plan revenue increase of $120 million for test year 2023, effective for rates beginning September 2024;\n•\na $140 million cumulative cap on base formula rate plan revenue increases, if needed, for test years 2024 and 2025, excluding outside the bandwidth items;\n•\n$184 million of customer rate credits to be given over two years, including increasing customer sharing of income tax benefits resulting from the 2016-2018 IRS audit, to resolve any remaining disputed issues stemming from formula rate plan test years prior to test year 2023, including but not limited to the investigation into Entergy Services costs billed to Entergy Louisiana.  As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, a $38 million regulatory liability was recorded in 2023 in connection with the 2016-2018 IRS audit;\n•\n$75.5 million of customer rate credits, as provided for in the System Energy global settlement, to be credited over three years subject to and conditioned upon FERC approval of the System Energy global settlement, which was approved in November 2024.  See “\nComplaints Against System Energy\n – System Energy Settlement with the LPSC\n” in Note 2 to the financial statements for further details of the System Energy global settlement;\n359\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\n•\n$5.8 million of customer rate credits provided for in the Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan global settlement agreement approved by the LPSC in November 2023 credited over one year.  See “Formula Rate Plan Global Settlement” below for further discussion of the settlement;\n•\nan increase in the allowed midpoint return on common equity from 9.5% to 9.7%, with a bandwidth of 40 basis points above and below the midpoint, for the extended term of the formula rate plan, except that for test year 2023 in which the authorized return on common equity shall have no bearing on the change in base formula rate plan revenue described above and, for test year 2024, any earnings above the authorized return on common equity shall be returned to customers through a credit;\n•\nan increase in nuclear depreciation rates by $15 million in each of the 2023, 2024, and 2025 test years outside of the formula rate plan bandwidth calculation; and\n•\nfor the transmission recovery mechanism and the distribution recovery mechanism, no change to the existing floors, but the caps for both would be $350 million for test year 2023, $375 million for test year 2024, and $400 million for test year 2025.  Transmission projects filed with the LPSC will be exempt from the transmission recovery mechanism cap.\nThe global stipulated settlement agreement was unanimously approved by the LPSC in August 2024 and an order was issued by the LPSC in September 2024 reflecting the approval of the settlement.\nBased on the July 2024 agreement in principle, in second quarter 2024 Entergy Louisiana recorded expenses of $151 million ($112 million net-of-tax) primarily consisting of regulatory charges to reflect the effects of the agreement in principle.\nFormula Rate Plan Global Settlement\nIn October 2023 the LPSC staff and Entergy Louisiana reached a global settlement which resolved all outstanding issues related to the 2017, 2018, and 2019 formula rate plan filings and resolved certain issues with respect to the 2020 and 2021 formula rate plan filings.  The settlement was approved by the LPSC in November 2023.  The settlement resulted in a one-time cost of service credit to customers of $5.8 million, allowed Entergy Louisiana to retain approximately $6.2 million of securitization over-collection as recovery of a regulatory asset associated with late fees related to the 2016 Baton Rouge flood, and resulted in Entergy Louisiana recording the reversal of a $105.6 million regulatory liability, primarily associated with the Hurricane Isaac securitization, recognized in 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the reversal of the regulatory liability.\n2023 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn August 2024, pursuant to the global stipulated settlement agreement, Entergy Louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2023 calendar year operations.  Consistent with the global stipulated settlement agreement, the filing reflected a 9.7% allowed return on common equity with a bandwidth of 40 basis points above and below the midpoint.  For the 2023 test year, however, the bandwidth provisions of the formula rate plan were temporarily suspended and, pursuant to the terms of the global stipulated settlement agreement, Entergy Louisiana implemented the September 2024 formula rate plan rate adjustments effective with the first billing cycle of September 2024.  Those adjustments included a $120 million increase in base rider formula rate plan revenue and a $101.8 million one-time incremental net decrease consistent with the terms of the global stipulated settlement.  The formula rate plan rate adjustments reflected in the evaluation report also include a redetermination of the transmission recovery mechanism, the distribution recovery mechanism, the additional capacity mechanism, the tax adjustment mechanism, the MISO cost recovery mechanism, and other one-time adju\nstments.  In January 2025, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC filed a joint report indicating that no disputed issues remained in the proceeding and requesting that the LPSC issue an order accepting Entergy Louisiana’s evaluation report and, ultimately, resolving this matter.  Entergy Louisiana expects a decision on the joint report in first quarter 2025.\n360\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nInvestigation of Costs Billed by Entergy Services\nIn November 2018 the LPSC issued a notice of proceeding initiating an investigation into costs incurred by Entergy Services that are included in the retail rates of Entergy Louisiana.  As stated in the notice of proceeding, the LPSC observed an increase in capital construction-related costs incurred by Entergy Services.  Discovery was issued and included efforts to seek highly detailed information on a broad range of matters unrelated to the scope of the audit.  In September 2024 the LPSC issued an order approving a settlement that resolved, with prejudice, all other issues identified by the staff in the matter and closed the docket.  See “2023 Entergy Louisiana Rate Case and Formula Rate Plan Extension Request” above for further discussion.\nFuel and purchased power cost recovery\nEntergy Louisiana recovers electric fuel and purchased power costs for the billing month based upon the level of such costs incurred two months prior to the billing month.  Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustments include estimates for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.\nTo mitigate high electric bills, primarily driven by high summer usage and elevated gas prices, Entergy Louisiana deferred approximately $225 million of fuel expense incurred in April, May, June, July, August, and September 2022 (as reflected on June, July, August, September, October, and November 2022 bills).  These deferrals were included in the over/under calculation of the fuel adjustment clause, which is intended to recover the full amount of the costs included on a rolling twelve-month basis.\nIn March 2020 the LPSC staff provided notice of an audit of Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings.  The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause for the period from 2016 through 2019.  The LPSC staff issued its audit report in September 2021, and although certain internal record keeping recommendations were made, the LPSC staff did not recommend any disallowances.  The next step is for the LPSC to review the report, but there is not a deadline for the review.\nIn January 2023 the LPSC staff provided notice of an audit of Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustment clause filings.  The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustment clause for the period from 2021 through 2022.  Discovery is ongoing, and no audit report has been filed.\nIn January 2023 the LPSC staff provided notice of an audit of Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause filings.  The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through Entergy Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause for the period from 2020 through 2022.  Discovery is ongoing, and no audit report has been filed.\nCOVID-19 Orders\nIn April 2020 the LPSC issued an order authorizing utilities to record as a regulatory asset expenses incurred from the suspension of disconnections and collection of late fees imposed by LPSC orders associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nIn April 2023, Entergy Louisiana filed an application proposing to utilize approximately $1.6 billion in certain low interest debt to generate earnings to apply toward the reduction of the COVID-19 regulatory asset, as well as to conduct additional outside right-of-way vegetation management activities and fund the minor storm reserve account.  In that filing, Entergy Louisiana proposed to delay repayment of certain shorter-term first mortgage bonds that were issued to finance storm restoration costs until the costs could be securitized, and to invest the funds that otherwise would be used to repay those bonds in the money pool to take advantage of the spread between prevailing interest rates on investments in the money pool and the interest rates on the bonds.  The LPSC approved Entergy Louisiana’s requested relief in June 2023.  In November 2024, Entergy Louisiana submitted a filing to the LPSC requesting that the LPSC review Entergy Louisiana’s computation of the COVID-19 regulatory asset as well as Entergy Louisiana’s proposal to offset the regulatory asset against the interest earned on \n361\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nthe short-term debt funds, resulting in no increased costs to customers.  At the time of the filing, Entergy Louisiana had a regulatory asset of $47.8 million for costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.  As of December 31, 2024, Entergy Louisiana had a regulatory liability of $48.9 million for the deferred earnings related to the approximately $1.6 billion in low interest debt\n, which had been fully repaid by August 2024\n.  \nIn granting Entergy Louisiana’s requested relief in June 2023, the LPSC ordered that any amount of earnings exceeding the amount of the COVID-19 regulatory asset be transferred to Entergy Louisiana’s storm reserve escrow account.\nIndustrial and Commercial Customers\nEntergy Louisiana’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs.  In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Louisiana’s industrial customer base.  Entergy Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles.  Entergy Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers.\nFederal Regulation\nSee the “\nRate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation\n \n– Federal Regulation\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation.\nNuclear Matters\nEntergy Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the River Bend and Waterford 3 nuclear generating plants and is, therefore, subject to the risks related to such ownership and operation.  These include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues related to equipment reliability, to position Entergy Louisiana’s nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license amendments, and decommissioning; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts of insurance recoveries for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident.  In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of River Bend or Waterford 3, Entergy Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.  Waterford 3’s operating license expires in 2044 and River Bend’s operating license expires in 2045.\nEnvironmental Risks\nEntergy Louisiana’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “\nRegulation of Entergy’s Business\n - \nEnvironmental Regulation\n” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.\n362\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in these assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNuclear Decommissioning Costs\nSee “\nNuclear Decommissioning Costs\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\nSee “\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation.\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\nSee “\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nEntergy Louisiana’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are affected by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.   See “\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.\nCost Sensitivity\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Qualified Pension Cost\nImpact on 2024 Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$960\n$25,042\nRate of return on plan assets\n(0.25%)\n$2,759\n$—\nRate of increase in compensation\n0.25%\n$1,193\n$6,054\n363\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefits cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Postretirement Benefits Cost\nImpact on 2024 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$284\n$3,760\nHealth care cost trend\n0.25%\n$487\n$2,455\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.\nCosts and Employer Contributions\nTotal qualified pension cost for Entergy Louisiana in 2024 was $10.7 million.

Entergy Louisiana expects 2025 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $1.1 million.  Entergy Louisiana contributed $16.9 million to its other postretirement plans in 2024 and estimates that 2025 contributions will be approximately $14.4 million.\nOther Contingencies\nSee “\nOther Contingencies\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the estimates associated with environmental, litigation, and other risks.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee the “\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n” section of Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\n364\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the member and Board of Directors of\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity (pages \n367\n through \n372\n and applicable items in pages \n47\n through 239), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRate and Regulatory Matters\n — \nEntergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries\n — \nRefer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Louisiana Public Service Commission (the “LPSC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric companies in Louisiana, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n365\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight.  Because the LPSC and the FERC set the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities.  The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the LPSC and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs, and refunds to customers. Auditing management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the LPSC and the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the LPSC and the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the LPSC and the FERC for the Company to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the LPSC’s and the FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the LPSC and the FERC and orders issued, and considered the filings with the LPSC and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions\n.\n•\nWe obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order, to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or refund or a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nFebruary 18, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001.\n366\nTable of Contents\nENTERGY LOUISIANA, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In Thousands)\nOPERATING REVENUES\n \n \n \nElectric\n$\n5,068,158\n \n$\n5,073,239\n \n$\n6,246,933\n \nNatural gas\n75,860\n \n74,531\n \n91,835\n \nTOTAL\n5,144,018\n \n5,147,770\n \n6,338,768\n \nOPERATING EXPENSES\n \n \n \nOperation and Maintenance:\n \n \n \nFuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale\n1,026,343\n \n1,080,485\n \n2,002,456\n \nPurchased power\n670,874\n \n654,721\n \n1,076,715\n \nNuclear refueling outage expenses\n76,020\n \n63,429\n \n59,698\n \nOther operation and maintenance\n1,097,283\n \n1,097,233\n \n1,139,605\n \nDecommissioning\n80,663\n \n75,962\n \n72,122\n \nTaxes other than income taxes\n248,472\n \n245,191\n \n241,908\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n770,904\n \n726,389\n \n695,204\n \nOther regulatory charges (credits) -

This increase is the result of higher fixed charges, partially offset by lower volumetric rates, applied to lower usage.  The increase was substantially offset by a decrease in industrial usage primarily due to a decrease in demand from large industrial customers, primarily in the primary metals and transportation industries.\nThe retail electric price variance is primarily due to increases in formula rate plan rates effective April 2024 and July 2024, including the implementation of the interim facilities rate adjustment effective over six months beginning in July 2024.  See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for discussion of the formula rate plan filings.\n373\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nTotal electric energy sales for Entergy Mississippi for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n(GWh)\nResidential\n5,443 \n5,460 \n— \nCommercial\n4,587 \n4,640 \n(1)\nIndustrial\n2,317 \n2,347 \n(1)\nGovernmental\n397 \n407 \n(2)\n  Total retail  \n12,744 \n12,854 \n(1)\nSales for resale:\n  Non-associated companies\n5,568 \n4,598 \n21 \nTotal\n18,312 \n17,452 \n5 \nSee Note 19 to the financial statements for additional discussion of Entergy Mississippi’s operating revenues.\nOther Income Statement Variances\nOther operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of $12.9 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to lower vegetation maintenance costs and \na decrease of $7.5 million in non-nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work during plant outages performed in 2024 as compared to 2023.  \nThe decrease was partially offset by:\n•\nan increase of $6.4 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher healthcare claims activity, including lower prescription drug rebates in 2024 as compared to 2023 and higher incentive-based accruals in 2024 as compared to 2023;\n•\nan increase of $4.1 million in storm damage provisions.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy Mississippi’s storm damage mitigation and restoration rider; and\n•\nan increase of $3.1 million in energy efficiency expenses primarily due to \nthe timing of recovery from customers.\nTaxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to\n \nincreases in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.\nOther regulatory charges (credits) - net includes regulatory credits of $7.3 million, recorded in second quarter 2024, to reflect the effects of the joint stipulation reached in the 2024 formula rate plan filing proceeding.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the 2024 formula rate plan filing.\nOther income increased primarily due to \na decrease of $4.5 million in non-service pension costs primarily as a result of pension settlement charges recorded in 2023 and a reduction in 2024 in the amortization of deferred pension losses as a result of an amendment to a qualified pension plan spinning-off predominantly inactive participants into a new qualified plan, extending the amortization period for deferred losses.  See \n“\nMANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - \nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs.\nInterest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of 5.85% Series mortgage bonds in May 2024 and higher carrying costs related to the deferred fuel balance, partially offset by the repayment of a $150 \n374\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nmillion unsecured term loan, of which $50 million was repaid in May 2023 and $100 million was repaid in December 2023.\nThe effective income tax rates were 24.7% for 2024 and 23.0% for 2023.

See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of  Entergy Mississippi’s storm escrow account activity.\nThe increase was partially offset by:\n•\na decrease of $46.3 million\n \nin distribution construction expenditures primarily due to lower capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2024;\n•\nthe substantial completion and final payments totaling approximately $35.1 million in 2023 for the purchase of the Sunflower Solar facility by a consolidated tax equity partnership.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for discussion of the Sunflower Solar facility purchase; and\n•\na decrease of $11 million in facilities construction expenditures primarily due to the construction of a new transmission office in 2023.\nIncreases in Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool increased $15.2 million in 2024 compared to decreasing by $26.9 million in 2023.  \nThe money pool is an intercompany cash management program that makes possible intercompany borrowing and lending arrangements, and the money pool and other borrowing arrangements are designed to reduce the Registrant Subsidiaries’ dependence on external short-term borrowings.\nFinancing Activities\nEntergy Mississippi’s financing activities provided $154.8 million of cash in 2024 compared to using $41.8 million of cash in 2023 \nprimarily due to the following activity:\n•\nthe repayment, prior to maturity, of $250 million of 3.10% Series mortgage bonds in June 2023;\n•\nthe repayment of a $150 million unsecured term loan in 2023;\n•\nan increase of $75.4 million in advance payments from customers for construction related to transmission, distribution, and generator interconnection agreements;\n•\na capital contribution of $25.7 million \nreceived in April 2023 from the noncontrolling tax equity investor in MS Sunflower Partnership, LLC and used by the partnership for payments in the acquisition of the Sunflower Solar facility.

Entergy Mississippi uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Mississippi’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nEntergy Mississippi seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings.  To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.  To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Mississippi may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions,  or both, to maintain its capital structure.  In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reduced distributions, Entergy Mississippi may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure.\nUses of Capital\nEntergy Mississippi requires capital resources for:\n•\nconstruction and other capital investments;\n•\ndebt maturities or retirements;\n377\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\n•\nworking capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and\n•\ndistributions and interest payments.\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi’s planned construction and other capital investments.\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n \n(In Millions)\nPlanned construction and capital investment:\n \n \nGeneration\n$1,135 \n$1,605 \n$895 \nTransmission\n195 \n200 \n110 \nDistribution\n270 \n360 \n405 \nUtility Support\n55 \n40 \n55 \nTotal\n$1,655 \n$2,205 \n$1,465 \nIn addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Mississippi includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, expand, and diversify Entergy Mississippi’s portfolio, as well as to support customer growth, including Delta Blues Advanced Power Station, Delta Solar, and Penton Solar; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to improve reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion and customer growth; and other investments.  Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, governmental actions, including trade-related governmental actions, such as tariffs and other measures, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital, including any changes to governmental programs, such as loans, grants, guarantees, and other subsidies.  Entergy Mississippi is not able to predict the effect of potential changes in regulation and law, changes to governmental programs, such as loans, grants, guarantees, and other subsidies, and trade-related governmental actions, such as tariffs and other measures, on its current and planned capital projects.\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments).\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028-2029\nAfter 2029\n \nLong-term debt (a)\n$98 \n$98 \n$248 \n$545 \n$3,516 \nOperating leases (b)\n$10 \n$9 \n$8 \n$9 \n$3 \nFinance leases (b)\n$4 \n$3 \n$3 \n$4 \n$24 \n(a)\nLong-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n(b)\nLease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.\nOther Obligations\nEntergy Mississippi currently expects to contribute approximately $8.1 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $178 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2025, although the 2025 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2025, valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2025.  See “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \n– Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.\n378\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nEntergy Mississippi has $1.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes plus interest for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn addition, Entergy Mississippi enters into fuel and purchased power agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations.  Entergy Mississippi has rate mechanisms in place to recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs incurred under these purchase obligations.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy Mississippi’s obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.\nAs a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy Mississippi pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly.\nAdditional Generation and Transmission Resources\nIn January 2024, Amazon Web Services announced its plan to invest in two data centers located in Madison County, Mississippi.  In March 2024, Entergy Mississippi executed a large customer supply and service agreement to serve the two data centers.  Entergy Mississippi will need generation and transmission resources to reliably serve all Entergy Mississippi customers, including the data centers.  The large customer supply and service agreement also contains provisions which cover Entergy Mississippi’s incremental investment costs in the event of early termination.  In May 2024 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s revisions to its formula rate plan to comply with state legislation passed in January 2024 allowing Entergy Mississippi to make interim rate adjustments, including the collection of a return on construction-work-in-process on a cash basis, to recover the non-fuel related annual ownership cost of certain facilities that directly or indirectly provide service to customers who own certain data processing center projects as specified in the legislation.  Entergy Mississippi anticipates recovering the incremental cost to serve the customer through the revenues it expects to collect under the large customer supply and service agreement.\nIn February 2025, Entergy Mississippi entered into a new large customer supply and service agreement with a customer.  The planned capital investment estimates for 2025-2027, shown above, include amounts related to the generation and transmission resources needed to reliably serve all Entergy Mississippi customers.\nDelta Blues Advanced Power Station\nIn September 2024, Entergy Mississippi announced plans to construct, own, and operate the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station, a 754 MW combined-cycle combustion turbine facility, to be located in Washington County, Mississippi.  The facility will primarily be powered by natural gas, and it will also be enabled for future carbon capture and storage and for hydrogen co-firing optionality.  The Delta Blues Advanced Power Station will cost an estimated $1.2 billion.  State legislation passed in January 2024 provides for the pre-certification of construction for certain types of facilities that directly or indirectly provide electric service to customers who own certain data processing center projects as specified in the legislation.  Construction of the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station qualifies under this legislation for pre-certification.  As enabled by this legislation, Entergy Mississippi began recovery of certain costs of construction of the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station through the interim facilities rate adjustments provision of its formula rate plan rider, which rates became effective in July 2024.  Non-fuel revenue collected from the data center customer will be included in the formula rate plan to offset the facility’s revenue requirement.  Construction is in progress and the facility is expected to be in service by the end of 2028.\nDelta Solar\nIn December 2024 the Bolivar County Board of Supervisors approved Entergy Mississippi’s plans to construct, own, and operate the Delta Solar facility, an 80 MW solar facility to be located in Bolivar County, \n379\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nMississippi. The Delta Solar facility will cost an estimated $157.2 million, inclusive of estimated transmission interconnection costs.

Entergy Mississippi is regulated, and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings.  A governmental agency, the MPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.\nFilings with the MPSC\nRetail Rates\n2022 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn March 2022, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2022 test year filing and 2021 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned return for the historical 2021 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2022 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth.  The 2022 test year filing showed a $69 million rate increase was necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s earned return on common equity to the specified point of adjustment of 6.70% return on rate base, within the formula rate plan bandwidth.  The change in formula rate plan revenues, however, was capped at 4% of retail revenues, which equated to a revenue change of $48.6 million.  The 2021 look-back filing compared actual 2021 results to the approved benchmark return on rate base and reflected the need for a $34.5 million interim increase in formula rate plan revenues.  In fourth quarter 2021, Entergy Mississippi recorded a regulatory asset of $19 million to reflect the then-current estimate in connection with the look-back feature of the formula rate plan.  In accordance with the provisions of the formula rate plan, Entergy Mississippi implemented a $24.3 million interim rate increase, reflecting a cap equal to 2% of 2021 retail revenues, effective in April 2022.  With the implementation of the interim formula rate plan rates, Entergy Mississippi began recovery of the bad debt expense deferral resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic over a three-year period.\nIn June 2022, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation that confirmed the 2022 test year filing that resulted in a total rate increase of $48.6 million.  Pursuant to the joint stipulation, Entergy Mississippi’s 2021 look-back filing reflected an earned return on rate base of 5.99% in calendar year 2021, which was below the look-back bandwidth, resulting in a $34.3 million increase in the formula rate plan revenues on an interim basis through June 2023.  In July 2022 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation with rates effective in August 2022.  In July 2022, Entergy Mississippi recorded regulatory credits of $22.6 million to reflect the effects of the joint stipulation.\nIn July 2022 the MPSC directed Entergy Mississippi to flow $14.1 million of the power management rider over-recovery balance to customers beginning in August 2022 through December 2022 to mitigate the bill impact of the increase in formula rate plan revenues.\n2023 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn March 2023, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2023 test year filing and 2022 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned return on rate base for the historical 2022 calendar year to be \n381\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nbelow the formula rate plan bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2023 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth.  The 2023 test year filing showed a $39.8 million rate increase was necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s earned return on rate base to the specified point of adjustment of 6.67%, within the formula rate plan bandwidth.  The 2022 look-back filing compared actual 2022 results to the approved benchmark return on rate base and reflected the need for a $19.8 million temporary increase in formula rate plan revenues, including the refund of a $1.3 million over-recovery resulting from the demand-side management costs true-up for 2022.  In fourth quarter 2022, Entergy Mississippi recorded a regulatory asset of $18.2 million in connection with the look-back feature of the formula rate plan to reflect that the 2022 estimated earned return was below the formula rate plan bandwidth.  In accordance with the provisions of the formula rate plan, Entergy Mississippi implemented a $27.9 million interim rate increase, reflecting a cap equal to 2% of 2022 retail revenues, effective in April 2023.\nIn May 2023, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation that confirmed a 2023 test year filing resulting in a total revenue increase of $26.5 million for 2023.  Pursuant to the joint stipulation, Entergy Mississippi’s 2022 look-back filing reflected an earned return on rate base of 6.10% in calendar year 2022, which was below the look-back bandwidth, resulting in a $19.0 million increase in the formula rate plan revenues on an interim basis through June 2024.  Entergy Mississippi recorded a regulatory credit of $0.8 million in June 2023 to reflect the increase in the look-back regulatory asset.  In addition, certain long-term service agreement and conductor handling costs were authorized for realignment from the formula rate plan to the annual power management and grid modernization riders effective January 2023, resulting in regulatory credits recorded in June 2023 of $4.1 million and $4.3 million, respectively.  Also, the amortization of Entergy Mississippi’s COVID-19 bad debt expense deferral was suspended for calendar year 2023, but resumed in July 2024.  In June 2023 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation with rates effective in July 2023.\n2024 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn March 2024, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2024 test year filing and 2023 look-back filing showing Entergy Mississippi’s earned return on rate base for the historical 2023 calendar year to be within the formula rate plan bandwidth and projected earned return for the 2024 calendar year to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth.  The 2024 test year filing showed a $63.4 million rate increase was necessary to reset Entergy Mississippi’s earned return on rate base to the specified point of adjustment of 7.10%, within the formula rate plan bandwidth.  The 2023 look-back filing compared actual 2023 results to the approved benchmark return on rate base and reflected no change in formula rate plan revenues.  In accordance with the provisions of the formula rate plan, Entergy Mississippi implemented a $32.6 million interim rate increase, reflecting a cap equal to 2% of 2023 retail revenues, effective April 2024.\nIn December 2014 the MPSC ordered Entergy Mississippi to file an updated depreciation study at least once every four years.  Pursuant to this order and Entergy Mississippi’s filing cycle, Entergy Mississippi would have filed an updated depreciation report with its formula rate plan filing in 2023.  However, in July 2022 the MPSC directed Entergy Mississippi to file its next depreciation study in connection with its 2024 formula rate plan filing notwithstanding the MPSC’s prior order.  Accordingly, Entergy Mississippi filed a depreciation study in February 2024.  The study showed a need for an increase in annual depreciation expense of $55.2 million.  The calculated increase in annual depreciation expense was excluded from Entergy Mississippi’s 2024 formula rate plan revenue increase request because the MPSC had not yet approved the proposed depreciation rates.\nIn June 2024, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff entered into a joint stipulation that confirmed the 2024 test year filing, with the exception of immaterial adjustments to certain operation and maintenance expenses.  After performance adjustments, the formula rate plan reflected an earned return on rate base of 6.08% for calendar year 2024, which resulted in a total revenue increase of $64.6 million for 2024.  The joint stipulation also recommended approval of a revised customer charge of $31.82 per month for residential customers and $53.10 per month for general service customers.  Pursuant to the stipulation, Entergy Mississippi’s 2023 look-back filing reflected an earned return on rate base of 6.81%, resulting in an increase of $0.3 million in the formula rate plan revenues for 2023.  Finally, the stipulation recommended approval of Entergy Mississippi’s proposed \n382\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\ndepreciation rates with those rates to be implemented upon request and approval at a later date.  In June 2024 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation with rates effective in July 2024.  The approval also included a reduction to the energy cost factor, resulting in a net bill decrease for a typical residential customer using 1,000 kWh per month.  Also in June 2024, Entergy Mississippi recorded regulatory credits of $7.3 million to reflect the difference between interim rates placed in effect in April 2024 and the rates reflected in the joint stipulation.\nIn May 2024, Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC for formula rate plan revisions that were necessary for Entergy Mississippi to comply with state legislation passed in January 2024.  The legislation allows Entergy Mississippi to make interim rate adjustments to recover the non-fuel related annual ownership cost of certain facilities that directly or indirectly provide service to customers who own certain data processing center projects as specified in the legislation.  Entergy Mississippi filed the first of its annual interim facilities rate adjustment reports in May 2024 to recover approximately $8.7 million of these costs over a six-month period with rates effective beginning in July 2024.  Entergy Mississippi filed its second annual interim facilities rate adjustment report in December 2024 to recover approximately $46.7 million of these costs over a 12-month period with rates effective beginning in January 2025.\nGrand Gulf Capacity Filing\nIn September 2024, Entergy Mississippi filed a notice of intent with the MPSC to implement revisions to its unit power cost recovery rider that would allow Entergy Mississippi to recover the first year of costs associated with the transfer of Entergy Louisiana’s entitlements to Grand Gulf capacity and energy, which consists of Entergy Louisiana’s interest in and purchases of Grand Gulf capacity and energy under the revised rider schedule, effective by January 1, 2025.  This notice filing related to the divestiture of Entergy Louisiana’s 14% share of Grand Gulf capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and 2.43% share of capacity and energy from Entergy Arkansas under the MSS-4 replacement tariff.  This divestiture is being effectuated initially through Entergy Mississippi’s purchases from Entergy Louisiana pursuant to a PPA governed by the MSS-4 replacement tariff, a tariff governing the sales of energy and capacity among the Utility operating companies as described in the System Energy global settlement with the LPSC and Entergy Louisiana. \n \nThe MSS-4 replacement PPA to effectuate this divestiture was approved by the FERC in November 2024.  In February 2025 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s notice of intent, finding that it was just and reasonable for Entergy Mississippi to obtain Entergy Louisiana’s entitlements to Grand Gulf capacity and energy and that Entergy Mississippi should be allowed to recover the costs associated with the transfer of such entitlements to Grand Gulf capacity and energy, as described above.  The MPSC approved the MSS-4 replacement PPA, effective as of January 1, 2025.  See “\nComplaints Against System Energy\n \n- System Energy Settlement with the LPSC\n” in Note 2 to the financial statements for further details of the System Energy global settlement with the LPSC and Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the Unit Power Sales Agreement.\nFuel and purchased power cost recovery\nEntergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider and a power management rider, both of which are adjusted annually to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries.  Entergy Mississippi recovers fuel and purchased energy costs through its energy cost recovery rider and recovers costs associated with natural gas hedging and capacity payments through its power management rider.  Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC.\nIn November 2021, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider.  The calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately $80.6 million as of September 30, 2021.  In December 2021, at the request of the MPSC, Entergy Mississippi submitted a proposal to mitigate the impact of rising fuel costs on customer bills during 2022.  Entergy Mississippi proposed that the deferred fuel balance as of December 31, 2021, which was $121.9 million, be amortized over three years and that the MPSC authorize Entergy Mississippi to apply its weighted-average cost of capital as the carrying cost for the unamortized fuel balance.  In January 2022 the MPSC approved the amortization \n383\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nof $100 million of the deferred fuel balance over two years and authorized Entergy Mississippi to apply its weighted-average cost of capital as the carrying cost for the unamortized fuel balance.  The MPSC approved the proposed energy cost factor effective for February 2022 bills.\nSee\n “\nComplaints Against System Energy\n - System Energy Settlement with the MPSC” \nin Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the settlement agreement filed with the FERC in June 2022.  The settlement, which was approved by the FERC in November 2022, provided for a refund of $235 million from System Energy to Entergy Mississippi.  In July 2022 the MPSC directed the disbursement of settlement proceeds, ordering Entergy Mississippi to provide a one-time $80 bill credit to each of its approximately 460,000 retail customers to be effective during the September 2022 billing cycle and to apply the remaining proceeds to Entergy Mississippi’s under-recovered deferred fuel balance.  In accordance with the MPSC’s directive, Entergy Mississippi provided approximately $36.7 million in customer bill credits as a result of the settlement.  In November 2022, Entergy Mississippi applied the remaining settlement proceeds in the amount of approximately $198.3 million to Entergy Mississippi’s under-recovered deferred fuel balance.\nEntergy Mississippi had a deferred fuel balance of approximately $291.7 million under the energy cost recovery rider as of July 31, 2022, along with an over-recovery balance of $51.1 million under the power management rider.  Without further action, Entergy Mississippi anticipated a year-end deferred fuel balance of approximately $200 million after application of a portion of the System Energy settlement proceeds, as discussed above.  In September 2022, Entergy Mississippi filed for interim adjustments under both the energy cost recovery rider and the power management rider.  Entergy Mississippi proposed five monthly incremental adjustments to the net energy cost factor designed to collect the under-recovered fuel balance as of July 31, 2022 and to reflect the recovery of a higher natural gas price.  Entergy Mississippi also proposed five monthly incremental adjustments to the power management adjustment factor designed to flow through to customers the over-recovered power management rider balance as of July 31, 2022.  In October 2022 the MPSC approved modified interim adjustments to Entergy Mississippi’s energy cost recovery rider and power management rider.  The MPSC approved dividing the energy cost recovery rider interim adjustment into two components that would allow Entergy Mississippi to (1) recover a natural gas fuel rate that is better aligned with current prices; and (2) recover the estimated under-recovered deferred fuel balance as of September 30, 2022 over a period of 20 months.  The MPSC approved six monthly incremental adjustments to the net energy cost factor designed to reflect the recovery of a higher natural gas price.  The MPSC also approved six monthly incremental adjustments to the power management adjustment factor designed to flow through to customers the over-recovered power management rider balance.  In accordance with the order of the MPSC, Entergy Mississippi did not file an annual redetermination of the energy cost recovery rider or the power management rider in November 2022.\nIn June 2023 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation agreement between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff for Entergy Mississippi’s 2023 formula rate plan filing.  The stipulation directed Entergy Mississippi to make a compliance filing to revise its power management cost adjustment factor, to revise its grid modernization cost adjustment factor, and to include a revision to reduce the net energy cost factor to a level necessary to reflect an average natural gas price of $4.50 per MMBtu.  The MPSC approved the compliance filing in June 2023, effective for July 2023 bills.  See “\nRetail Rate Proceedings\n - \nFilings with the MPSC (Entergy Mississippi)\n - \nRetail Rates\n - 2023 Formula Rate Plan Filing” in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the 2023 formula rate plan filing and the joint stipulation agreement.\nIn November 2023 Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redeterminations of the energy cost factor and the power management cost adjustment factor.  The calculation of the annual factor for the energy cost recovery rider included a projected over-recovery balance of approximately $142 million at the end of January 2024.  The calculation of the annual factor for the power management rider included a projected under-recovery of $47 million at the end of January 2024.  In January 2024 the MPSC approved the proposed energy cost factor and the proposed power management cost factor effective for February 2024 bills.\n384\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nIn June 2024 the MPSC approved the joint stipulation agreement between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff for Entergy Mississippi’s 2024 formula rate plan filing.  The 2024 formula rate plan filing included the conclusion of the modified interim adjustments to Entergy Mississippi’s energy cost recovery rider and power management rider, which were approved in October 2022 and allowed Entergy Mississippi to recover certain under-collected fuel balances, effective for July 2024 bills..  The stipulation provided for Entergy Mississippi to reduce its net energy cost factor.  See “\nRetail Rate Proceedings\n - \nFilings with the MPSC (Entergy Mississippi)\n - \nRetail Rates\n - 2024 Formula Rate Plan Filing” in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the 2024 formula rate plan filing and the joint stipulation agreement.\nIn November 2024, Entergy Mississippi filed its annual redeterminations of the energy cost factor and the power management cost adjustment factor.  The calculation of the annual factor for the energy cost recovery rider included a projected over-recovery balance of approximately $144.6 million as of September 2024.  The calculation of the annual factor for the power management rider included a projected under-recovery of $60.1 million as of September 2024.  In January 2025 the MPSC approved a revised energy cost factor, effective for February 2025 bills, that did not reflect the fuel savings associated with Entergy Mississippi’s incremental increase in its share of capacity and energy in connection with Entergy Mississippi’s assumption of Entergy Louisiana’s entitlements to Grand Gulf capacity and energy, which was subject to the MPSC’s review at such time.  In February 2025 the MPSC approved Entergy Mississippi’s notice of intent for Entergy Mississippi’s assumption of Entergy Louisiana’s entitlements to Grand Gulf capacity and energy, with associated fuel savings to be reflected in Entergy Mississippi’s energy cost recovery rider, effective for March 2025 bills.  Additionally, in February 2025 the MPSC approved the proposed power management cost adjustment factor, effective for March 2025 bills.\nStorm Cost Recovery Filings with Retail Regulators\nPrior to June 2024, Entergy Mississippi had approval from the MPSC to collect a storm damage provision of $1.75 million per month.  If Entergy Mississippi’s accumulated storm damage provision balance exceeded $15 million, the collection of the storm damage provision ceased until such time that the accumulated storm damage provision became less than $10 million.  Entergy Mississippi’s storm damage provision balance had been less than $10 million since May 2019, and Entergy Mississippi had been billing the monthly storm damage provision since July 2019.\nIn December 2023, Entergy Mississippi filed a Notice of Storm Escrow Disbursement and Request for Interim Relief notifying the MPSC that Entergy Mississippi had requested disbursement of approximately $34.5 million of storm escrow funds from its restricted storm escrow account.  The filing also requested authorization from the MPSC, on a temporary basis, that the $34.5 million of storm escrow funds be credited to Entergy Mississippi’s storm damage provision, pending the MPSC’s review of Entergy Mississippi’s storm-related costs, and that Entergy Mississippi continue to bill its monthly storm damage provision without suspension in the event the storm damage provision balance exceeded $15 million, in anticipation of a subsequent filing by Entergy Mississippi  in this proceeding.  The storm damage provision exceeded $15 million upon receipt of the storm escrow funds.  Because the MPSC had not entered an order on Entergy Mississippi’s filing on the requested relief to continue billing this provision, Entergy Mississippi suspended billing the monthly storm damage provision effective with February 2024 bills.\nIn March 2024, Entergy Mississippi made a combined dual filing which included a notice of intent to make routine change in rates and schedules and a motion for determination relating to the above-described notice of storm escrow disbursement.  The notice of intent proposed a new storm damage mitigation and restoration rider to supersede both the then-current storm damage rate schedule and the vegetation management rider schedule, in which the collection of both expenses would be combined.  The proposal requested that the MPSC authorize Entergy Mississippi to collect approximately $5.2 million per month for vegetation management and a storm damage provision.  Furthermore, if Entergy Mississippi’s accumulated vegetation management and storm damage provision balance were to exceed $70 million\n, collection under the storm damage mitigation and restoration rider \n385\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nwould cease until such time that the accumulated vegetation management and storm damage provision would become less than $60 million.\nThe Mississippi Public Utilities Staff reviewed the storm-related costs submitted by Entergy Mississippi and found them prudent.  In June 2024 the MPSC considered and unanimously granted the relief sought by Entergy Mississippi, including authorization to credit any remaining funds in the storm escrow account to Entergy Mississippi’s storm damage provision and to close the storm escrow account and approving the new storm damage mitigation and restoration rider.  Entergy Mississippi’s storm escrow account was liquidated in July 2024, and t\nhe new combined storm damage mitigation and restoration rider became effective with the July 2024 billing cycle.  Additionally, Entergy Mississippi made a compliance filing to cease billing under the existing vegetation management rider schedule as of the same billing cycle.\nFederal Regulation\nSee the “\nRate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation\n \n– Federal Regulation\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation.\nNuclear Matters\nSee the “\nNuclear Matters\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of nuclear matters.\nEnvironmental Risks\nEntergy Mississippi’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy Mississippi is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “\nRegulation of Entergy’s Business\n - \nEnvironmental Regulation\n” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in these assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\nSee “\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation.\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\nSee “\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\n386\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nEntergy Mississippi’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are affected by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  See “\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.\nCost Sensitivity\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Qualified Pension Cost\nImpact on 2024 Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$178\n$5,973\nRate of return on plan assets\n(0.25%)\n$726\n$—\nRate of increase in compensation\n0.25%\n$249\n$1,397\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefits cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Postretirement Benefits Cost\nImpact on 2024 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$77\n$912\nHealth care cost trend\n0.25%\n$112\n$594\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.\nCosts and Employer Contributions\nTotal qualified pension cost for Entergy Mississippi in 2024 was $3.3 million.  Entergy Mississippi anticipates 2025 qualified pension cost to be $3.5 million.  Entergy Mississippi contributed $15 million to its qualified pension plans in 2024 and estimates 2025 pension contributions will be approximately $8.1 million\n,\n although the 2025 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2025 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2025.\nTotal postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy Mississippi in 2024 was $3.7 million.  Entergy Mississippi expects 2025 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $3.9 million.  In 2024, Entergy Mississippi’s contributions to its other postretirement plans, specifically its contributions to the external trusts plus claims payments, were offset by trust claims reimbursements, resulting in a net reimbursement of $23 thousand.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRate and Regulatory Matters\n — \nEntergy Mississippi, LLC and Subsidiaries\n — \nRefer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (the “MPSC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric companies in Mississippi, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n389\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight.  Because the MPSC and the FERC set the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities.  The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the MPSC and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers. Auditing management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the MPSC and the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the MPSC and the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the MPSC and the FERC for the Company to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the MPSC’s and FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the MPSC and the FERC and orders issued, and considered the filings with the MPSC and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.\n•\nWe obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or refund or a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nFebruary 18, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001.\n390\nTable of Contents\nENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In Thousands)\nOPERATING REVENUES\n \n \n \nElectric\n$\n1,764,593\n \n$\n1,802,533\n \n$\n1,624,234\n \nOPERATING EXPENSES\n \n \n \nOperation and Maintenance:\n \n \n \nFuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale\n270,015\n \n563,296\n \n252,760\n \nPurchased power\n273,580\n \n281,761\n \n322,674\n \nOther operation and maintenance\n315,651\n \n320,192\n \n314,902\n \nTaxes other than income taxes\n166,195\n \n150,921\n \n137,541\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n270,483\n \n262,624\n \n246,063\n \nOther regulatory charges (credits) -

The decrease in industrial usage is primarily due to a decrease in demand from large industrial customers, primarily in the industrial gases industry\n.\nStorm restoration carrying costs represent the equity component of storm restoration carrying costs, recorded in fourth quarter 2023, recognized as part of the City Council’s approval of the Hurricane Ida storm cost certification report in December 2023.

The increase in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy New Orleans is primarily due to common equity distributions of $125 million in 2024 and the net issuance of long-term debt in 2024.\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nDebt to capital\n51.5 \n%\n45.8 \n%\nEffect of excluding securitization bonds \n— \n%\n(0.2 \n%)\nDebt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a)\n51.5 \n%\n45.6 \n%\nEffect of subtracting cash\n(1.1 \n%)\n— \n%\nNet debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a)\n50.4 \n%\n45.6 \n%\n(a)\nCalculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy New Orleans.\nNet debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion, and the long-term payable due to an associated company.  Capital consists of debt and equity.  Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.  The debt to capital ratio excluding securitization bonds and net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds are non-GAAP measures.  Entergy New Orleans uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans’s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy New Orleans, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements.  Entergy New Orleans also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy New Orleans’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nEntergy New Orleans seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings.  To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.  To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy New Orleans may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure.  In addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as financing of large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reduced distributions, Entergy New Orleans may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure.\nUses of Capital\nEntergy New Orleans requires capital resources for:\n•\nconstruction and other capital investments;\n•\nworking capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs;\n•\ndebt maturities or retirements; and\n•\ndistribution and interest payments.\n401\nTable of Contents\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy New Orleans’s planned construction and other capital investments.\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n \n(In Millions)\nPlanned construction and capital investment:\n \nGeneration\n$30 \n$15 \n$10 \nTransmission\n20 \n5 \n30 \nDistribution\n125 \n190 \n110 \nUtility Support\n20 \n20 \n15 \nTotal\n$195 \n$230 \n$165 \nIn addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy New Orleans includes distribution and Utility support spending to deliver reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to improve reliability and resilience; and other investments.  Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, governmental actions, including trade-related governmental actions, such as tariffs and other measures, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital, including any changes to governmental programs, such as loans, grants, guarantees, and other subsidies.  Entergy New Orleans is not able to predict the effect of potential changes in regulation and law, changes to governmental programs, such as loans, grants, guarantees, and other subsidies, and trade-related governmental actions, such as tariffs and other measures, on its current and planned capital projects.\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy New Orleans’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments).\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028-2029\nAfter 2029\n \n(In Millions)\nLong-term debt (a)\n$111 \n$116 \n$29 \n$92 \n$873 \nOperating leases (b)\n$2 \n$2 \n$2 \n$2 \n$1 \nFinance leases (b)\n$1 \n$1 \n$1 \n$3 \n$1 \n(a)\nLong-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n(b)\nLease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.\nOther Obligations\nEntergy New Orleans currently expects to contribute approximately $5 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $205 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2025, although the 2025 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2025, valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2025.  See “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.\nEntergy New Orleans has $7.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes plus interest for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn addition, Entergy New Orleans enters into fuel and purchased power agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations.  Entergy New Orleans has rate mechanisms in place to recover fuel, purchased power, and \n402\nTable of Contents\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nassociated costs incurred under these purchase obligations.  See Note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy New Orleans’s obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.\nAs a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Utility Holding Company, LLC, Entergy New Orleans pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly.\nResilience and Grid Hardening\nIn October 2021 the City Council passed a resolution and order establishing a docket and procedural schedule with respect to system resiliency and storm hardening.  In July 2022, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council a response identifying a preliminary plan for storm hardening and resiliency projects, including microgrids, to be implemented over ten years at an approximate cost of $1.5 billion.  In February 2023 the City Council approved a revised procedural schedule requiring Entergy New Orleans to make a filing in April 2023 containing a narrowed list of proposed hardening projects.  In April 2023, Entergy New Orleans filed the required application and supporting testimony seeking City Council approval of the first phase (five years and $559 million) of a ten-year infrastructure hardening plan totaling approximately $1 billion.  Entergy New Orleans also sought, among other relief, City Council approval of a resilience and storm hardening cost recovery rider to recover from customers the costs of the infrastructure hardening plan.  In February 2024 the City Council approved a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to implement a resilience project to be partially funded by $55 million of matching funding through the DOE’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program.  The resolution also required Entergy New Orleans to submit, no later than July 2024, a revised resilience plan consisting of projects over a three-year period.  In March 2024, Entergy New Orleans filed with the City Council for approval the requested three-year resilience plan, which includes $168 million in hardening projects.  The three-year resilience plan was to be in addition to the previously authorized resilience project to be partially funded by the DOE’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program.  In October 2024 the City Council approved a resolution authorizing a two-year resilience plan totaling $100 million and approved the requested resilience and storm hardening cost recovery rider.  In December 2024, Entergy New Orleans notified the City Council of the subset of hardening projects from the revised three-year resilience plan to be included in the two-year resilience plan.  Entergy New Orleans implemented the approved resilience and storm hardening cost recovery rider effective with the first billing cycle of January 2025.\nSources of Capital\nEntergy New Orleans’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:\n•\ninternally generated funds;\n•\ncash on hand;\n•\nthe Entergy system money pool;\n•\nstorm reserve escrow accounts;\n•\ndebt and preferred membership interest issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness;\n•\ncapital contributions; and\n•\nbank financing under new or existing facilities.\nCircumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future.  In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Entergy New Orleans expects to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit.\nAll debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy New Orleans require prior regulatory approval.  Debt issuances are also subject to requirements set forth in its bond indenture and other \n403\nTable of Contents\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nagreements.  Entergy New Orleans has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\nEntergy New Orleans’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n(In Thousands)\n$3,146\n($21,651)\n$147,254\n$36,410\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.\nEntergy New Orleans has a credit facility in the amount of $25 million scheduled to expire in June 2027.  The credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $10 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility.  As of December 31, 2024, there were no cash borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. \n \nIn addition, Entergy New Orleans is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO.  As of December 31, 2024, a $0.5 million letter of credit was outstanding under Entergy New Orleans’s uncommitted letter of credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities.\nEntergy New Orleans obtained authorization from the FERC through January 2027 for short-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $150 million at any time outstanding and long-term borrowings and securities issuances.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy New Orleans’s short-term borrowing limits.  The long-term securities issuances of Entergy New Orleans are limited to amounts authorized not only by the FERC, but also by the City Council, and the current City Council authorization extends through December 2025.\nHurricane Francine\nIn September 2024, Hurricane Francine caused damage to the areas served by Entergy New Orleans.  The storm resulted in widespread power outages, primarily due to damage to distribution infrastructure as a result of strong winds and heavy rain, and the loss of sales during the power outages.  In December 2024, in accordance with the terms of its storm recovery reserve escrow agreement, Entergy New Orleans transmitted to the City Council a notice of intent to withdraw up to $20 million in estimated storm costs resulting from Hurricane Francine from its storm recovery reserve escrow account, subject to the City Council’s certification of those costs.  In January 2025, the City Council authorized the withdrawal and in February 2025, Entergy New Orleans withdrew $10.3 million from its storm recovery reserve escrow account.\nState and Local Rate Regulation\nThe rates that Entergy New Orleans charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy New Orleans is regulated, and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings.  A governmental agency, the City Council, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.\nRetail Rates\n2022 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn April 2022, Entergy New Orleans submitted to the City Council its formula rate plan 2021 test year filing.  The 2021 test year evaluation report, subsequently updated in a July 2022 filing, produced an earned return on equity of 6.88% compared to the authorized return on equity of 9.35%.  Entergy New Orleans sought approval of \n404\nTable of Contents\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\na $42.1 million rate increase based on the formula set by the City Council in the 2018 rate case.  The formula resulted in an increase in authorized electric revenues of $34.1 million and an increase in authorized gas revenues of $3.3 million.  Entergy New Orleans also sought to commence collecting $4.7 million in electric revenues that were previously approved by the City Council for collection through the formula rate plan.  In July 2022 the City Council’s advisors issued a report seeking a reduction to Entergy New Orleans’s proposed increase of approximately $17.1 million in total for electric and gas revenues.  Effective with the first billing cycle of September 2022, Entergy New Orleans implemented rates reflecting an amount agreed upon by Entergy New Orleans and the City Council including adjustments filed in the City Council’s advisors’ report, per the approved process for formula rate plan implementation.  The total formula rate plan increase implemented was $24.7 million, which includes an increase of $18.2 million in electric revenues, $4.7 million in previously approved electric revenues, and an increase of $1.8 million in gas revenues.  Additionally, credits of $13.9 million funded by certain regulatory liabilities currently held by Entergy New Orleans for customers were issued over an eight-month period beginning September 2022.\n2023 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn April 2023, Entergy New Orleans submitted to the City Council its formula rate plan 2022 test year filing.  The 2022 test year evaluation report produced an electric earned return on equity of 7.34% and a gas earned return on equity of 3.52% compared to the authorized return on equity for each of 9.35%.  Entergy New Orleans sought approval of a $25.6 million rate increase based on the formula set by the City Council in the 2018 rate case.  The formula would result in an increase in authorized electric revenues of $17.4 million and an increase in authorized gas revenues of $8.2 million.  Entergy New Orleans also sought to commence collecting $3.4 million in electric revenues that were previously approved by the City Council for collection through the formula rate plan.  In July 2023, Entergy New Orleans filed a report to decrease its requested formula rate plan revenues by approximately $0.5 million to account for minor errors discovered after the filing.  The City Council advisors issued a report seeking a reduction in the requested formula rate plan revenues of approximately $8.3 million, combined for electric and gas, due to alleged errors.  The City Council advisors proposed additional rate mitigation in the amount of $12 million through offsets to the formula rate plan rate increase by certain regulatory liabilities.  In September 2023 the City Council approved an agreement to settle the 2023 formula rate plan filing.  Effective with the first billing cycle of September 2023, Entergy New Orleans implemented rates reflecting an amount agreed upon by Entergy New Orleans and the City Council, per the approved process for formula rate plan implementation.  The agreement provides for a total increase in electric revenues of $10.5 million and a total increase in gas revenues of $6.9 million.  The agreement also provides for a minor storm accrual of $0.5 million per year and the distribution of $8.9 million of currently held customer credits to implement the City Council advisors’ mitigation recommendations.\nRequest for Extension and Modification of Formula Rate Plan\nIn September 2023, Entergy New Orleans filed a motion seeking City Council approval of a three-year extension of Entergy New Orleans’s electric and gas formula rate plans.  In October 2023 the City Council granted Entergy New Orleans’s request for an extension, subject to minor modifications which included a 55% equity ratio for rate setting purposes.\n2024 Formula Rate Plan Filing\nIn April 2024, Entergy New Orleans submitted to the City Council its formula rate plan 2023 test year filing.  Without the requested rate change in 2024, the 2023 test year evaluation report produced an electric earned return on equity of 8.66% and a gas earned return on equity of 5.87% compared to the authorized return on equity for each of 9.35%.  Entergy New Orleans sought approval of a $12.6 million rate increase based on the formula set by the City Council in the 2018 rate case and approved again by the City Council in 2023.  The formula would result in an increase in authorized electric revenues of $7.0 million and an increase in authorized gas revenues of $5.6 million.  Following City Council review, the City Council’s advisors issued a report in July 2024 seeking a \n405\nTable of Contents\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nreduction in Entergy New Orleans’s requested formula rate plan revenues in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.6 million for electric and gas together due to alleged errors.  Effective with the first billing cycle of September 2024, Entergy New Orleans implemented rates reflecting an amount agreed upon by Entergy New Orleans and the City Council, per the approved process for formula rate plan implementation.  The total formula rate plan increase implemented was $11.2 million, which includes an increase of $5.8 million in electric revenues and an increase of $5.4 million in gas revenues.\nFuel and purchased power cost recovery\nEntergy New Orleans’s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.\nEntergy New Orleans’s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.\nRenewable Portfolio Standard Rulemaking\nIn March 2019 the City Council initiated a rulemaking proceeding to consider whether to establish a renewable portfolio standard.  The four components of the Renewable and Clean Portfolio Standard that the City Council expressed a desire to implement were: (1) a mandatory requirement that Entergy New Orleans achieve 100% net zero carbon emissions by 2040; (2) reliance on renewable energy credits purchased without the associated energy for compliance with the standard being phased out over the ten-year period from 2040 to 2050; (3) no carbon-emitting resources in the portfolio of resources Entergy New Orleans uses to serve New Orleans by 2050; and (4) a mechanism to limit costs in any one plan year to no more than one percent of plan year total utility retail sales revenues.  The City Council adopted the Utility Committee resolution in April 2020.  The City Council approved the rule in May 2021, establishing the Renewable and Clean Portfolio Standard.\nIn March 2022 the City Council approved Entergy New Orleans’s initial compliance plan and established an alternative compliance payment value of $8.45 per MWh, which Entergy New Orleans will pay if it is unable to comply with the Renewable and Clean Portfolio Standard for the 2022 compliance year.  Such compliance payments are paid into a clean energy fund established by the City Council.  The City Council also approved the electric vehicle credit calculation methodology for use in the compliance demonstration report for 2022, to be filed prior to May 1, 2023.  Entergy New Orleans’s proposal to create a 5% contingency reserve was considered reasonable for the initial compliance plan.\nIn August 2022, Entergy New Orleans submitted its compliance plan covering compliance years 2023-2025.  After receiving comments from intervenors and Entergy New Orleans, in December 2022 the City Council adopted a resolution that (a) approved Entergy New Orleans's proposal to purchase unbundled renewable energy credits, as needed; (b) denied Entergy New Orleans’s request to treat the Sewerage and Water Board’s 230 kV Sullivan substation electrification as a “qualified measure;” (c) approved the alternative compliance payment for years 2023-2025 at $8.45 per MWh; and (d) approved the Tier 3 credit calculations for electric vehicle charging infrastructure but denied the request to approve a Tier 3 credit for the Sewerage and Water Board substation electrification project at this time while the substation is not yet in service.\nIn May 2023, Entergy New Orleans submitted its compliance demonstration report to the City Council for the 2022 compliance year, which describes and demonstrates Entergy New Orleans’s compliance with the Renewable and Clean Portfolio Standard in 2022 and satisfies certain informational requirements.  Entergy New Orleans requested, among other things, that the City Council determine that Entergy New Orleans achieved the target under the portfolio standard for 2022 and remains within the customer protection cost cap, and that the City \n406\nTable of Contents\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nCouncil approve a proposal to recover costs associated with 2022 compliance.  In April 2024 the City Council approved a resolution finding Entergy New Orleans was in compliance with the 2022 requirements and that Entergy New Orleans did not exceed the customer protection cost cap, as well as approving Entergy New Orleans’s proposal to recover costs.\nIncome Tax Audits\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, in November 2023 the IRS completed its examination of the 2016 through 2018 tax years and issued a Revenue Agent Report for each federal filer under audit.  Based on prior regulatory agreements and general rate-making principles, in fourth quarter 2023 Entergy New Orleans recorded a regulatory liability and associated regulatory charge of $60 million ($44 million net-of-tax).  In April 2024, Entergy New Orleans and the City Council entered into a settlement in principle whereby Entergy New Orleans agreed to share with customers $138 million of income tax benefits from the resolution of the 2016–2018 IRS audit.  Based on this settlement in principle, in first quarter 2024, Entergy New Orleans increased the associated regulatory liability from $60 million to $138 million and recorded a corresponding $78 million regulatory charge ($57 million net-of-tax).  The settlement in principle requires that the regulatory liability be amortized over 25 years beginning in January 2025 with the unamortized balance included in rate base and the amortization treated as a reduction to Entergy New Orleans’s retail revenue requirement.  In May 2024 the City Council approved the settlement.\nFederal Regulation\nSee the “\nRate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation\n \n– Federal Regulation\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation.\nNuclear Matters\nSee the “\nNuclear Matters\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of nuclear matters.\nEnvironmental Risks\nEntergy New Orleans’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy New Orleans is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “\nRegulation of Entergy’s Business\n - \nEnvironmental Regulation\n” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in these assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n407\nTable of Contents\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\nSee “\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation.\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\nSee “\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nEntergy New Orleans’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are affected by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  See “\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.\nCost Sensitivity\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Qualified Pension Cost\nImpact on 2024 Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$101\n$2,787\nRate of return on plan assets\n(0.25%)\n$313\n$—\nRate of increase in compensation\n0.25%\n$140\n$601\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefits cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Postretirement Benefits Cost\nImpact on 2024 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$30\n$430\nHealth care cost trend\n0.25%\n$43\n$236\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.\nCosts and Employer Contributions\nTotal qualified pension cost for Entergy New Orleans in 2024 was $1.1 million.  Entergy New Orleans anticipates 2025 qualified pension cost to be $1.2 million.  Entergy New Orleans contributed $4.9 million to its qualified pension plans in 2024 and estimates 2025 pension contributions will be approximately $5 million, \n408\nTable of Contents\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nalthough the 2025 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2025 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2025.\nTotal postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy New Orleans in 2024 was $5.5 million.  Entergy New Orleans expects 2025 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $5.6 million.\n  \nEntergy New Orleans contributed\n \n$134 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2024 and estimates 2025 contributions will be approximately $205 thousand.\nOther Contingencies\nSee “\nOther Contingencies\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the estimates associated with environmental, litigation, and other risks.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee the “\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n” section of Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\n409\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the member and Board of Directors of\nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and changes in member’s equity (pages \n412\n through \n416\n and applicable items in pages \n47\n through 239), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRate and Regulatory Matters\n — \nEntergy New Orleans, LLC and Subsidiaries\n — \nRefer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Council of the City of New Orleans, Louisiana (the “City Council”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric companies in the City of New Orleans, Louisiana, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n410\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight.  Because the City Council and the FERC set the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities.  The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the City Council and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers. Auditing management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the City Council and the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the City Council and the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the City Council and the FERC for the Company to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the City Council’s and the FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the City Council and the FERC and orders issued, and considered the filings with the City Council and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions\n.\n•\nWe obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or refund or a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nFebruary 18, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001.\n411\nTable of Contents\nENTERGY NEW ORLEANS, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In Thousands)\nOPERATING REVENUES\n \n \n \nElectric\n$\n708,354\n \n$\n737,974\n \n$\n855,248\n \nNatural gas\n102,210\n \n105,959\n \n142,085\n \nTOTAL\n810,564\n \n843,933\n \n997,333\n \nOPERATING EXPENSES\n \n \n \nOperation and Maintenance:\n \n \n \nFuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale\n99,055\n \n122,400\n \n244,994\n \nPurchased power\n252,863\n \n268,478\n \n314,283\n \nOther operation and maintenance\n172,101\n \n167,719\n \n156,653\n \nTaxes other than income taxes\n60,476\n \n62,979\n \n63,743\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n84,937\n \n81,282\n \n76,938\n \nOther regulatory charges (credits) -

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nResults of Operations\n2024 Compared to 2023\nNet Income\nNet income increased $2.3 million primarily due to higher other income and higher retail electric price, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses and higher other operation and maintenance expenses.\nOperating Revenues\nFollowing is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2024 to 2023:\n \nAmount\n \n(In Millions)\n2023 operating revenues\n$2,028.6 \nFuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income\n3.4 \nRetail electric price\n15.4 \nVolume/weather\n2.8 \n2024 operating revenues\n$2,050.2\n \nEntergy Texas’s results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income.  “Fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income” includes the revenue variance associated with these items.\nThe retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in base rates effective June 2023 and the implementation of the distribution cost recovery factor rider effective with the first billing cycle in October 2024, partially offset by the implementation of the generation cost recovery relate-back rider for the Hardin County Peaking Facility effective over three months beginning in May 2023.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the 2022 base rate case, the distribution cost recovery factor rider, and the generation cost recovery rider filings.\nThe volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in commercial usage and an increase in weather-adjusted residential usage, partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales.  The increases in commercial usage and in weather-adjusted residential usage were primarily due to an increase in customers.\n417\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nTotal electric energy sales for Entergy Texas for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n(GWh)\nResidential\n6,597 \n6,731 \n(2)\nCommercial\n4,879 \n4,797 \n2 \nIndustrial\n9,457 \n9,343 \n1 \nGovernmental\n269 \n275 \n(2)\n  Total retail  \n21,202 \n21,146 \n— \nSales for resale:\n  Non-associated companies\n687 \n462 \n49 \nTotal\n21,889 \n21,608 \n1 \nSee Note 19 to the financial statements for additional discussion of Entergy Texas’s operating revenues.\nOther Income Statement Variances\nOther operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:\n•\nan increase of $8.7 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher healthcare claims activity, including lower prescription drug rebates in 2024 as compared to 2023;\n•\na gain of $6.9 million on the partial sale of a service center in April 2023 as part of an eminent domain proceeding;\n•\nan increase of $3.9 million in bad debt expense;\n•\nan increase of $3.2 million in storm damage provisions;\n•\nan increase of $2.6 million in transmission costs allocated by MISO; and\n•\nseveral individually insignificant items.\nThe increase was partially offset by a decrease of $13.3 million in power delivery expenses primarily due to lower vegetation maintenance costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the recognition of $27.6 million in depreciation expense in 2024 for the 2022 base rate case relate back period, effective over six months beginning January 2024.  The recognition of depreciation expense for the relate back period was effective over the same period as collections from the relate back surcharge rider and results in no effect on net income.  Also contributing to the increase were additions to plant in service.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the 2022 base rate case.\nOther regulatory charges (credits) - net includes the reversal in third quarter 2023 of $21.9 million of regulatory liabilities to reflect the recognition of certain receipts by Entergy Texas under affiliated PPAs that have been resolved.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the 2022 base rate case.\nOther income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2024, including the Orange County Advanced Power Station project.\nInterest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $350 million of 5.80% Series mortgage bonds in August 2023 and the issuance of $350 million of 5.55% Series mortgage bonds in August 2024, partially offset by \n418\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nan increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2024, including the Orange County Advanced Power Station project.\nThe effective income tax rates were 18.3% for 2024 and 17.8% for 2023.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates and for additional discussion regarding income taxes.\n2023 Compared to 2022\nSee “\nMANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n - \nResults of Operations\n” in Item 7 of Entergy Texas’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, for discussion of results of operations for 2023 compared to 2022.\nIncome Tax Legislation and Regulation\nSee the “\nIncome Tax Legislation and Regulation\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of income tax legislation and regulation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow\n    Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In Thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n$21,986 \n$3,497 \n$28 \nNet cash provided by (used in):\n \n \n \nOperating activities\n823,649 \n641,691 \n409,427 \nInvesting activities\n(928,418)\n(1,125,948)\n(764,069)\nFinancing activities\n267,780 \n502,746 \n358,111 \nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n163,011 \n18,489 \n3,469 \nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n$184,997 \n$21,986 \n$3,497 \n2024 Compared to 2023\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities increased $182 million in 2024 primarily due to lower fuel and purchased power costs and the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel and purchased power cost recovery.  The increase was partially offset by:\n•\nthe timing of payments to vendors;\n•\nan increase of $22.6 million in interest paid; and\n•\nan increase of $14.5 million in storm spending primarily due to Hurricane Beryl restoration efforts in 2024.\n419\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flow used in investing activities decreased $197.5 million in 2024 primarily due to money pool activity and cash collateral of $7 million posted in 2023, and subsequently returned to Entergy Texas in 2024, to support Entergy Texas’s obligations to MISO.  The decrease was partially offset by:\n•\nan increase of $148.8 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to higher capital expenditures as a result of increased development in Entergy Texas’s service area and increased spending on various transmission projects in 2024;\n•\nan increase of $108.2 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to higher capital expenditures for storm restoration in 2024 and higher capital expenditures as a result of increased development in Entergy Texas’s service area.  The increase in storm restoration expenditures is primarily due to Hurricane Beryl restoration efforts in 2024;\n•\nan increase of $92.4 million in non-nuclear generation construction expenditures primarily due to higher spending on the Legend Power Station project; and\n•\nthe partial sale of a service center in April 2023 for $11 million as part of an eminent domain proceeding.\nDecreases in Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool decreased $299.4 million in 2024 compared to increasing by $218.4 million in 2023.  The money pool is an intercompany cash management program that makes possible intercompany borrowing and lending arrangements, and the money pool and other borrowing arrangements are designed to reduce the Registrant Subsidiaries’ dependence on external short-term borrowings.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities decreased $235 million in 2024 primarily due to:\n•\na capital contribution of $150 million received from Entergy Corporation in 2023 in order to maintain Entergy Texas’s capital structure and in anticipation of various capital expenditures;\n•\nthe payment of $69 million of common stock dividends in 2024.  No common stock dividends were paid in 2023 in order to maintain Entergy Texas’s capital structure; and\n•\na decrease of $13.2 million in advance payments from customers for construction related to transmission, distribution, and generator interconnection agreements.\n2023 Compared to 2022\nSee “\nMANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n - \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n - \nCash Flow\n” in Item 7 of Entergy Texas’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2024, for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2023 compared to 2022.\n420\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nCapital Structure\nEntergy Texas’s debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table.\n \nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nDebt to capital\n51.6 \n%\n50.9 \n%\nEffect of excluding securitization bonds\n(1.7 \n%)\n(2.1 \n%)\nDebt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a)\n49.9 \n%\n48.8 \n%\nEffect of subtracting cash\n(1.5 \n%)\n(0.2 \n%)\nNet debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (non-GAAP) (a)\n48.4 \n%\n48.6 \n%\n(a)\nCalculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Texas.\nNet debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of finance lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion.  Capital consists of debt and equity.  Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents.  The debt to capital ratio excluding securitization bonds and net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds are non-GAAP measures.  Entergy Texas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas’s financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements.  Entergy Texas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas’s financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy Texas’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nEntergy Texas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings.  To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.  To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, Entergy Texas may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its capital structure.  In addition, Entergy Texas may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure for certain circumstances such as financing of large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reduced dividends.\nUses of Capital\nEntergy Texas requires capital resources for:\n•\nconstruction and other capital investments;\n•\ndebt maturities or retirements;\n•\nworking capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and\n•\ndividend and interest payments.\n421\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Texas’s planned construction and other capital investments.\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n \n(In Millions)\nPlanned construction and capital investment:\n \n \nGeneration\n$835 \n$850 \n$350 \nTransmission\n310 \n410 \n830 \nDistribution\n450 \n395 \n325 \nUtility Support\n45 \n55 \n30 \nTotal\n$1,640 \n$1,710 \n$1,535 \nIn addition to routine capital spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Texas includes investments in generation projects to modernize, decarbonize, expand, and diversify Entergy Texas’s portfolio, including Orange County Advanced Power Station, Lone Star Power Station, Segno Solar, and Votaw Solar; distribution and Utility support spending to improve reliability, resilience, and customer experience; transmission spending to improve reliability and resilience while also supporting renewables expansion and customer growth; and other investments.  Estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints and requirements, governmental actions, including trade-related governmental actions, such as tariffs and other measures, environmental compliance, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital, including any changes to governmental programs, such as loans, grants, guarantees, and other subsidies.  Entergy Texas is not able to predict the effect of potential changes in regulation and law, changes to governmental programs, such as loans, grants, guarantees, and other subsidies, and trade-related governmental actions, such as tariffs and other measures, on its current and planned capital projects.\nFollowing are the amounts of Entergy Texas’s existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments).\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028-2029\nAfter 2029\n \n(In Millions)\nLong-term debt (a)\n$160 \n$289 \n$308 \n$595 \n$4,944 \nOperating leases (b)\n$9 \n$8 \n$6 \n$7 \n$2 \nFinance leases (b)\n$3 \n$2 \n$2 \n$3 \n$2 \n(a)\nLong-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.\n(b)\nLease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements.\nOther Obligations\nEntergy Texas currently expects to contribute approximately $7.7 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $156 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2025, although the 2025 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2025, valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2025.  See “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.\nEntergy Texas has $69.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes plus interest and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.\n422\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nIn addition, Entergy Texas enters into fuel and purchased power agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations.  Entergy Texas has rate mechanisms in place to recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs incurred under these purchase obligations.\nAs a subsidiary, Entergy Texas dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly.\nOrange County Advanced Power Station\nIn September 2021, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking PUCT approval to amend Entergy Texas’s certificate of convenience and necessity to construct, own, and operate the Orange County Advanced Power Station, a new 1,215 MW combined-cycle combustion turbine facility to be located in Bridge City, Texas at an initially-estimated expected total cost of $1.2 billion inclusive of the estimated costs of the generation facilities, transmission upgrades, contingency, an allowance for funds used during construction, and necessary regulatory expenses, among others.  The project includes combustion turbine technology with dual fuel capability, able to co-fire up to 30% hydrogen by volume upon commercial operation and upgradable to support 100% hydrogen operations in the future.  In December 2021 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings. \n \nIn March 2022 certain intervenors filed testimony opposing the hydrogen co-firing component of the proposed project and others filed testimony opposing the project outright.  Also in March 2022 the PUCT staff filed testimony opposing the hydrogen co-firing component of the proposed project, but otherwise taking no specific position on the merits of the project.  The PUCT staff also proposed that the PUCT establish a maximum amount that Entergy Texas may recover in rates attributable to the project.  In April 2022, Entergy Texas filed rebuttal testimony addressing and rebutting these various arguments.  The hearing on the merits was held in June 2022, and post-hearing briefs were submitted in July 2022.  In September 2022 the ALJs with the State Office of Administrative Hearings issued a proposal for decision recommending the PUCT approve Entergy Texas’s application for certification of Orange County Advanced Power Station subject to certain conditions, including a cap on cost recovery at $1.37 billion, the exclusion of investment associated with co-firing hydrogen, weatherization requirements, and customer receipt of any contractual benefits associated with the facility’s guaranteed heat rate.  In October 2022 the parties in the proceeding filed exceptions and replies to exceptions to the proposal for decision.  Also in October 2022, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT information regarding a new fixed pricing option for an estimated project cost of approximately $1.55 billion associated with Entergy Texas’s issuance of limited notice to proceed by mid-November 2022.  In November 2022 the PUCT issued a final order approving the requested amendment to Entergy Texas’s certificate of convenience and necessity to construct, own, and operate the Orange County Advanced Power Station without the investment associated with hydrogen co-firing capability, without a cap on cost recovery, and subject to certain conditions, including weatherization requirements and customer receipt of any contractual benefits associated with the facility’s guaranteed heat rate.\nIn December 2022, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers and Sierra Club filed motions for rehearing of the PUCT’s final order alleging the PUCT erred in granting the certification of the Orange County Advanced Power Station, in not imposing a cost cap, in including certain findings related to the reasonableness of Entergy Texas’s request for proposals from which the Orange County Advanced Power Station was selected, and in other regards.  Also in December 2022, Entergy Texas filed a response to the motions for rehearing refuting the points raised therein.  In January 2023 the PUCT issued letters noting that it voted to consider Texas Industrial Energy Consumers’ motion for rehearing at its upcoming January 2023 open meeting and voted not to consider Sierra Club’s motion for rehearing at an open meeting.  At the January 2023 open meeting, the PUCT voted to grant Texas Industrial Energy Consumers’ motion for rehearing for the limited purpose of issuing an order on rehearing that excludes three findings related to Entergy Texas’s request for proposals.  The order on rehearing does not change the PUCT’s certification of the Orange County Advanced Power Station or the conditions placed thereon in the PUCT’s November 2022 final order.  Construction is in progress, and subject to receipt of required permits, the facility is expected to be in service by mid-2026.\n423\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nLegend Power Station and Lone Star Power Station\nIn June 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking PUCT approval to amend Entergy Texas’s certificate of convenience and necessity to construct, own, and operate the Legend Power Station, a 754 MW combined-cycle combustion turbine facility, which will be enabled for future carbon capture and storage and for hydrogen co-firing optionality, to be located in Jefferson County, Texas, and the Lone Star Power Station, a 453 MW simple-cycle combustion turbine facility, which will be enabled with hydrogen co-firing optionality, to be located in Liberty County, Texas.  In its application, Entergy Texas noted that the Legend Power Station was expected to cost an estimated $1.46 billion and the Lone Star Power Station was expected to cost an estimated $735.3 million, in each case inclusive of the estimated costs of the generation facilities, interconnection costs, transmission network upgrades, and an allowance for funds used during construction.  As described in the application, Entergy Texas is considering alternative financing approaches for the Legend Power Station and plans to pursue the financing option that is in the best interest of its customers.  In July 2024 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings and, also in July 2024, the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted a procedural schedule, with a hearing on the merits scheduled to begin in October 2024.  In September 2024, Entergy Texas filed, and the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings granted, a motion to extend the procedural schedule in this proceeding in order to address certain developments relating to the cost and scope of the Legend Power Station and the Lone Star Power Station.  In December 2024, Entergy Texas filed supplemental testimony and exhibits addressing the cost and scope developments associated with the Legend Power Station and the Lone Star Power Station in further support of its application.  The cost and scope developments include cost estimate increases of $139 million for Legend Power Station and $63.7 million for Lone Star Power Station and the consideration of an alternate site for Lone Star Power Station, which would reduce the estimated cost increase of the Lone Star Power Station to $36.2 million.  Also in December 2024, the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted a procedural schedule with a hearing on the merits to be held in April 2025.  A PUCT decision is expected in July 2025.  Subject to receipt of required regulatory approval and other conditions, both facilities are expected to be in service by mid-2028.\nSegno Solar and Votaw Solar\nIn July 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application seeking PUCT approval to amend Entergy Texas’s certificate of convenience and necessity to construct, own, and operate the Segno Solar facility, a 170 MW solar facility to be located in Polk County, Texas, and the Votaw Solar facility, a 141 MW solar facility to be located in Hardin County, Texas.  The Segno Solar facility will cost an estimated $351.6 million, and the Votaw Solar facility will cost an estimated $303.8 million, in each case inclusive of estimated transmission interconnection and upgrade costs.  In September 2024 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  In December 2024 the ALJs with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted a revised agreed procedural schedule, with a hearing on the merits to be held in March 2025.  In January 2025 certain intervenors and the PUCT staff filed testimony opposing Entergy Texas’s application.  The opposing testimony argues that the proposed generation additions will have a net cost to customers, and it also challenges the design and effectiveness of the voluntary renewable energy tariff.  In addition, the opposing testimony recommends that the PUCT impose conditions on any approval of Entergy Texas’s application.  The conditions that certain intervenors and the PUCT staff propose include guarantees related to customer net benefits, resource production, independent investigation of any material cost overruns, and the addition of a mandatory sleeving tariff.  Entergy Texas plans to file rebuttal testimony in February 2025.  A PUCT decision is expected in third quarter 2025.  Subject to receipt of required regulatory approval and other conditions, the Segno Solar facility is expected to be in service by early 2027, and the Votaw Solar facility is expected to be in service by mid-2028.\nResilience and Grid Hardening\nIn June 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT requesting approval of Phase I of its Texas Future Ready Resiliency Plan, a cost-effective set of measures to begin accelerating the resiliency of Entergy Texas’s transmission and distribution system.  Phase I is comprised of projects totaling approximately $335.1 \n424\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nmillion, including approximately $137 million of projects to be funded by Entergy Texas and approximately $198 million of projects contingent upon Entergy Texas’s receipt of grant funds in that amount from the Texas Energy Fund.  The projects in Phase I include distribution and transmission hardening and modernization projects and targeted vegetation management projects to mitigate the risk of wildfire.  These projects are expected to be implemented within approximately three years of PUCT approval.  In October 2024, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed settlement that would resolve all issues in the proceeding and the PUCT staff filed testimony in support of the unopposed settlement. \n \nIn January 2025 the PUCT unanimously approved Phase I of Entergy Texas’s Texas Future Ready Resiliency Plan, including the approximately $137 million of projects to be funded by Entergy Texas and application of performance metrics consistent with the unopposed settlement.  The PUCT clarified that, while not part of Entergy Texas’s Phase I plan, Entergy Texas is permitted to pursue the remaining $198 million of identified projects and Texas Energy Fund grant funding for those projects.  In February 2025 the PUCT issued an order adopting a new rule establishing the procedures for application to the grant fund and Entergy Texas intends to pursue an application.\nHurricane Beryl\nIn July 2024, Hurricane Beryl caused extensive damage to Entergy Texas’s service area.  The storm resulted in widespread power outages, as a result of extensive debris and damage to distribution and transmission infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages.  Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of Entergy Texas’s electric facilities damaged by Hurricane Beryl are currently estimated to be approximately $85 million.  Based on the historic treatment of such costs in Entergy Texas’s service area, management believes that recovery of restoration costs is probable.  There are well established mechanisms and precedent for addressing these catastrophic events and providing for recovery of prudently incurred storm costs in accordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles.  Entergy Texas expects to recover the majority of the restoration costs associated with Hurricane Beryl through its transmission and distribution cost recovery factor riders.\nSources of Capital\nEntergy Texas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:\n•\ninternally generated funds;\n•\ncash on hand;\n•\nthe Entergy system money pool;\n•\ndebt or preferred stock issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness;\n•\ncapital contributions; and\n•\nbank financing under new or existing facilities.\nCircumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future.  In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Entergy Texas expects to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit.\nAll debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Texas require prior regulatory approval.  Debt issuances are also subject to requirements set forth in its bond indenture and other agreements.  Entergy Texas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\n425\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nEntergy Texas’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n(In Thousands)\n$18,504\n$317,882\n$99,468\n($79,594)\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.\nEntergy Texas has a credit facility in the amount of $300 million scheduled to expire in June 2029.  The credit facility includes fronting commitments for the issuance of letters of credit against $25 million of the borrowing capacity of the facility.  As of December 31, 2024, there were no cash borrowings and $1.1 million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility.  In addition, Entergy Texas is a party to an uncommitted letter of credit facility as a means to post collateral to support its obligations to MISO.  As of December 31, 2024, $93.4 million in letters of credit were outstanding under Entergy Texas’s uncommitted letter of credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the credit facilities.\nEntergy Texas obtained authorizations from the FERC through January 2027 for short-term borrowings, not to exceed an aggregate amount of $200 million at any time outstanding, and long-term borrowings and security issuances.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Texas’s short-term borrowing limits.\nState and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery\nThe rates that Entergy Texas charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy Texas is regulated, and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings.  A governmental agency, the PUCT, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.\nFilings with the PUCT and Texas Cities\nRetail Rates\n2022 Base Rate Case\nIn July 2022, Entergy Texas filed a base rate case with the PUCT seeking a net increase in base rates of approximately $131.4 million.  The base rate case was based on a 12-month test year ending December 31, 2021.  Key drivers of the requested increase were changes in depreciation rates as the result of a depreciation study and an increase in the return on equity.  In addition, Entergy Texas included capital additions placed into service for the period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2021, including those additions reflected in the then-effective distribution and transmission cost recovery factor riders and the generation cost recovery rider, all of which were reset to zero in June 2023 as a result of this proceeding.  In July 2022 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  In October 2022 intervenors filed direct testimony challenging and supporting various aspects of Entergy Texas’s rate case application.  The key issues addressed included the appropriate return on equity, generation plant deactivations, depreciation rates, and proposed tariffs related to electric vehicles.  In November 2022 the PUCT staff filed direct testimony addressing a similar set of issues and recommending a reduction of $50.7 million to Entergy Texas’s overall cost of service associated with the requested net increase in base rates of approximately $131.4 million.  Entergy Texas filed rebuttal testimony in November 2022.\nIn May 2023, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties an unopposed settlement resolving all issues in the proceeding, except for issues related to electric vehicle charging infrastructure which were eventually severed to a separate proceeding and resolved in October 2024, and Entergy Texas filed an agreed motion for interim rates, \n426\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nsubject to refund or surcharge to the extent that the interim rates differ from the final approved rates.  The unopposed settlement reflected a net base rate increase to be effective and relate back to December 2022 of $54 million, exclusive of, and incremental to, the costs being realigned from the distribution and transmission cost recovery factor riders and the generation cost recovery rider and $4.8 million of rate case expenses to be recovered through a rider over a period of 36 months.  The net base rate increase of $54 million includes updated depreciation rates and a total annual revenue requirement of $14.5 million for the accrual of a self-insured storm reserve and the recovery of the regulatory assets for the pension and postretirement benefits expense deferral, costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and retired non-advanced metering system electric meters.  In May 2023 the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings granted the motion for interim rates, which became effective in June 2023.  Additionally, the ALJ remanded the proceeding to the PUCT to consider the settlement.  In August 2023 the PUCT issued an order approving the unopposed settlement.  Concurrently, Entergy Texas recorded the reversal of $21.9 million of regulatory liabilities to reflect the recognition of certain receipts by Entergy Texas under affiliated PPAs that have been resolved.\nFollowing the PUCT’s approval of the unopposed settlement in August 2023, Entergy Texas recorded a regulatory liability of $10.3 million, which reflected the net effects of higher depreciation and amortizations for the relate back period, partially offset by the relate back of base rate revenues that would have been collected had the approved rates been in effect for the period from December 2022 through June 2023, the date the new base rates were implemented on an interim basis.  In October 2023, Entergy Texas filed a relate back surcharge rider to collect over six months beginning in January 2024 an additional approximately $24.6 million, which was the revenue requirement associated with the relate back of rates from December 2022 through June 2023, including carrying costs, as authorized by the PUCT’s August 2023 order.  In November 2023, Entergy Texas filed an amended relate back surcharge rider to collect approximately $24.1 million based on a revised carrying cost rate.  The amended relate back surcharge rider was approved by the PUCT in December 2023.  The higher depreciation and amortizations for the relate back period were also recognized over the six months beginning in January 2024, resulting in no effect on net income from the collection of the relate back surcharge rider.\nDistribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) Rider\nIn June 2024, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new DCRF rider.  The new rider was designed to collect from Entergy Texas’s retail customers approximately $40.3 million annually based on its capital invested in distribution between January 1, 2022 and March 31, 2024.  In September 2024 the PUCT approved the DCRF rider, consistent with Entergy Texas’s as-filed request, and rates became effective with the first billing cycle in October 2024.\nIn September 2024, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its DCRF rider.  The amended rider was designed to collect from Entergy Texas’s retail customers approximately $48.9 million annually, or $8.6 million in incremental annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas’s then-effective DCRF rider based on its capital invested in distribution between April 1, 2024 and June 30, 2024.  In December 2024, Entergy Texas filed an errata to revise its DCRF application for minor corrections, which decreased the requested annual revenue requirement to $48.5 million.  The amended request represented an incremental increase of $8.2 million in annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas’s then-effective DCRF rider.  Also in December 2024 the PUCT approved the DCRF rider, consistent with Entergy Texas’s filed errata, and rates became effective on December 20, 2024.\nTransmission Cost Recovery Factor (TCRF) Rider\nIn December 2018, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to set a new TCRF rider.  The new TCRF rider was designed to collect approximately $2.7 million annually from Entergy Texas’s retail customers based on its capital invested in transmission between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2018.  In April 2019 parties filed testimony proposing a load growth adjustment, which would fully offset Entergy Texas’s proposed TCRF revenue requirement.  In July 2019 the PUCT granted Entergy Texas’s application as filed to begin recovery of the requested $2.7 million annual revenue requirement, rejecting opposing parties’ proposed adjustment; however, the PUCT \n427\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nfound that the question of prudence of the actual investment costs should be determined in Entergy Texas’s next rate case similar to the procedure used for the costs recovered through the DCRF rider.  In October 2019 the PUCT issued an order on a motion for rehearing, clarifying and affirming its prior order granting Entergy Texas’s application as filed.  Also in October 2019 a second motion for rehearing was filed, and Entergy Texas filed a response in opposition to the motion.  The second motion for rehearing was overruled by operation of law.  In December 2019, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers filed an appeal to the PUCT order in district court alleging that the PUCT erred in declining to apply a load growth adjustment.\nIn October 2021, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF rider.  The amended rider was designed to collect from Entergy Texas’s retail customers approximately $66.1 million annually, or $15.1 million in incremental annual revenues beyond Entergy Texas’s then-effective TCRF rider based on its capital invested in transmission between September 1, 2020 and July 31, 2021 and changes in approved transmission charges.  In January 2022 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  In February 2022 the parties filed an unopposed settlement recommending that Entergy Texas be allowed to collect its full requested TCRF revenue requirement with interim rates effective March 2022.  In February 2022 the ALJ granted the motion for interim rates, admitted evidence, and remanded the case to the PUCT for consideration of a final order at a future open meeting.  In June 2022 the PUCT issued an order approving the settlement.\nIn October 2024, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to amend its TCRF rider, which was previously reset to zero in June 2023 as a result of the 2022 base rate case.  The proposed rider is designed to collect from Entergy Texas’s retail customers approximately $9.7 million annually based on its capital invested in transmission between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2024 and changes in other transmission charges.  In December 2024 the PUCT staff filed a recommendation that the PUCT approve Entergy Texas’s as-filed application.  In February 2025 the PUCT staff issued a proposed order that, if approved by the PUCT, would approve Entergy Texas’s TCRF rider as filed.\nGeneration Cost Recovery Rider\nIn October 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application to establish a generation cost recovery rider to begin recovering a return of and on its generation capital investment in the Montgomery County Power Station.  Entergy Texas filed an unopposed settlement agreement in December 2020, and the PUCT approved the generation cost recovery rider settlement rates on an interim basis in January 2021.  In March 2021, Entergy Texas filed to update its generation cost recovery rider, and an unopposed settlement agreement filed by Entergy Texas on behalf of the parties in October 2021 was approved by the PUCT in January 2022.  In February 2022, Entergy Texas filed a relate-back rider to collect over five months an additional approximately $5 million, which was the difference between the interim revenue requirement approved in January 2021 and the revenue requirement approved in January 2022 reflecting Entergy Texas’s full generation capital investment and ownership in Montgomery County Power Station on January 1, 2021, plus carrying costs from January 2021 through January 2022 when the updated revenue requirement took effect.  The PUCT approved the relate-back rider consistent with Entergy Texas’s as-filed request, and rates became effective over a five-month period, in August 2022.\nIn December 2020, Entergy Texas also filed an application to amend its generation cost recovery rider to reflect its acquisition of the Hardin County Peaking Facility, which closed in June 2021.  Because Hardin was to be acquired in the future, the initial generation cost recovery rider rates proposed in the application represented no change from the generation cost recovery rider rates established in Entergy Texas’s previous generation cost recovery rider proceeding.  In July 2021 the PUCT issued an order approving the application.  In August 2021, Entergy Texas filed an update application to recover its actual investment in the acquisition of the Hardin County Peaking Facility, and in January 2022, Entergy Texas filed an update to its application to align the requested revenue requirement with the terms of the generation cost recovery rider settlement approved by the PUCT in January 2022.  In April 2022, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties a unanimous settlement agreement that would adjust its generation cost recovery rider to recover an annual revenue requirement of approximately $92.8 million, which was $4.5 million in incremental annual revenue above the revenue requirement approved in \n428\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nJanuary 2022 described above and related to Entergy Texas’s investment in the Montgomery County Power Station.  The PUCT approved the settlement agreement and rates became effective in August 2022.  In September 2022, Entergy Texas filed a relate-back rider designed to collect over three months an additional approximately $5.7 million, which is the revenue requirement, plus carrying costs, associated with Entergy Texas’s acquisition of Hardin County Peaking Facility from June 2021 through August 2022 when the updated revenue requirement took effect.  In April 2023 the PUCT approved Entergy Texas’s as-filed request with rates effective over three months beginning in May 2023.\nFuel and purchased power cost recovery\nEntergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including interest, not recovered in base rates.  Historically, semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor have been made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix.  The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT.  In 2023 the Texas legislature modified the Texas Utilities Code to provide that material over- and under-recovered fuel balances are to be refunded or surcharged through interim fuel adjustments and that fuel reconciliations must be filed at least once every two years.  Entergy Texas expects the PUCT to undertake a rulemaking to effectuate the new legislation in 2025.\nIn May 2022, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to implement an interim fuel surcharge to collect the cumulative under-recovery of approximately $51.7 million, including interest, of fuel and purchased power costs incurred from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021.  The under-recovery balance was primarily attributable to the impacts of Winter Storm Uri, including historically high natural gas prices, partially offset by settlements received by Entergy Texas from MISO related to Hurricane Laura.  Entergy Texas proposed that the interim fuel surcharge be assessed over a period of six months beginning with the first billing cycle after the PUCT issues a final order, but no later than the first billing cycle of September 2022.  Also in May 2022, the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  In July 2022, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties an unopposed settlement resolving all issues in the proceeding.  In addition, Entergy Texas filed on behalf of the parties a motion to admit evidence, to approve interim rates as requested in the initial application, and to remand the proceeding to the PUCT to consider the unopposed settlement.  In August 2022 the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings issued an order granting Entergy Texas’s motion, approving interim rates effective with the first billing cycle of September 2022, and remanding the case to the PUCT for final approval.  The interim fuel surcharge was approved by the PUCT in January 2023.\nIn September 2022, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period from April 2019 through March 2022.  During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas incurred approximately $1.7 billion in eligible fuel and purchased power expenses, net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments.  As of the end of the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas’s cumulative under-recovery balance was approximately $103.1 million, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry over as the beginning balance for the subsequent reconciliation period beginning April 2022, pending future surcharges or refunds as approved by the PUCT.  In November 2022 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  In July 2023, Entergy Texas filed an unopposed settlement, supporting testimony, and an agreed motion to admit evidence and remand the proceeding to the PUCT.  Pursuant to the unopposed settlement, Entergy Texas would receive no disallowance of fuel costs incurred over the three-year reconciliation period and retain $9.3 million in margins from off-system sales made during the reconciliation period, resulting in a cumulative under-recovery balance of approximately $99.7 million, including interest, as of the end of the reconciliation period.  In July 2023 the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings granted the motion to admit evidence and remanded the proceeding to the PUCT for consideration of the unopposed settlement.  The PUCT approved the settlement in September 2023.\nIn September 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period from April 2022 through March 2024.  During the reconciliation period, Entergy Texas \n429\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nincurred approximately $1.6 billion in eligible fuel and purchased power expenses to generate and purchase electricity to serve its customers, net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments.  Entergy Texas’s cumulative under-recovery balance for the reconciliation period was approximately $30 million, including interest, which Entergy Texas requested authority to carry over as part of the cumulative fuel balance for the subsequent reconciliation period beginning April 2024.  In November 2024 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  In December 2024 the ALJs with the State Office of Administrative Hearings adopted a procedural schedule, with a hearing on the merits scheduled for May 2025.  A PUCT decision is expected in third quarter 2025.\nIn December 2024, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to implement an interim fuel refund of $45.5 million, including interest.  Entergy Texas proposed that the interim fuel refund be implemented over a three-month period beginning with the first billing cycle in February 2025 for residential and other small customers and through a one-time credit, or surcharge depending on historical usage for the respective customer, for certain transmission voltage level and seasonal agricultural customers in February 2025.  Also in December 2024 the PUCT referred the proceeding to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.  In January 2025 the ALJ with the State Office of Administrative Hearings issued an order approving the interim fuel refund consistent with Entergy Texas’s application and, because no hearing was requested in the proceeding, dismissing the case from the State Office of Administrative Hearings and the PUCT.\nFederal Regulation\nSee the “\nRate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation\n \n– Federal Regulation\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation.\nNuclear Matters\nSee the “\nNuclear Matters\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of nuclear matters.\nIndustrial and Commercial Customers\nEntergy Texas’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs.  In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Texas’s industrial customer base.  Entergy Texas responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide, under existing rate schedules, competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles.  Entergy Texas actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers.\nEnvironmental Risks\nEntergy Texas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that Entergy Texas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “\nRegulation of Entergy’s Business\n - \nEnvironmental Regulation\n” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of Entergy Texas’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on \n430\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nreported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in these assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Texas’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\nSee “\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation.\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\nSee “\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nEntergy Texas’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are affected by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  See “\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.\nCost Sensitivity\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Qualified Pension Cost\nImpact on 2024 Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$145\n$4,710\nRate of return on plan assets\n(0.25%)\n$570\n$—\nRate of increase in compensation\n0.25%\n$202\n$865\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefits cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Postretirement Benefits Cost\nImpact on 2024 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$16\n$1,029\nHealth care cost trend\n0.25%\n$50\n$611\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.\n431\nTable of Contents\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nCosts and Employer Contributions\nTotal qualified pension cost for Entergy Texas in 2024 was $436 thousand.  Entergy Texas anticipates 2025 qualified pension cost to be $2.3 million.  Entergy Texas contributed $8.3 million to its qualified pension plans in 2024 and estimates 2025 pension contributions will be approximately $7.7 million, although the 2025 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2025 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2025.\nTotal postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for Entergy Texas in 2024 was $10.9 million.  Entergy Texas expects 2025 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income to approximate $10.6 million.  Entergy Texas contributed $690 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2024 and estimates 2025 contributions will be approximately $156 thousand.\nOther Contingencies\nSee “\nOther Contingencies\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the estimates associated with environmental, litigation, and other risks.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee the “\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n” section of Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\n432\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and Board of Directors of\nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and changes in equity (pages \n435\n through \n440\n and applicable items in pages \n47\n through 239), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRate and Regulatory Matters\n — \nEntergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries\n — \nRefer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the “PUCT”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric companies in Texas, and to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\n433\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight.  Because the PUCT and the FERC set the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities.  The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the PUCT and the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and refunds to customers. Auditing management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the PUCT and the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the PUCT and the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the PUCT and the FERC for the Company to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the PUCT’s and the FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the PUCT and the FERC and orders issued, and considered the filings with the PUCT and the FERC by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions\n.\n•\nWe obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or refund or a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nFebruary 18, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001.\n434\nTable of Contents\nENTERGY TEXAS, INC.

As discussed in “\nComplaints Against System Energy\n” below, \nSystem Energy and the Unit Power Sales Agreement have been the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC.  Settlements that resolve all significant aspects of these complaints have been reached with the MPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and the LPSC, and these settlements have been approved by the FERC.\nResults of Operations\n2024 Compared to 2023\nNet Income\nNet income decreased $5.3 million primarily due to the lower authorized rate of return on equity and capital structure limitations reflected in monthly bills issued to Entergy Arkansas effective with the November 2023 service month per the settlement agreement with the APSC, the lower authorized rate of return on equity and capital structure limitations reflected in monthly bills issued to Entergy New Orleans effective with the June 2024 service month per the settlement agreement with the City Council, and the lower authorized rate of return on equity and capital structure limitations reflected in monthly bills issued to Entergy Louisiana effective with the September 2024 service month per the settlement agreement with the LPSC.  The decrease was partially offset by an increase in operating revenues resulting from changes in rate base.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the settlements with the APSC, the City Council, and the LPSC.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rates w\nere\n \n22.2% f\nor 2024 and 22.7% for 2023.

System Energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy’s financial condition because net debt indicates System Energy’s outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nSystem Energy seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings.  To the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend or a capital distribution, to the extent funds are legally available to do so, or a combination of the three, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.  To the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments and other uses of cash such as the payment of expenses in the ordinary course, System Energy may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its capital structure.  In addition, System Energy may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure for certain circumstances that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reduced dividends.\nUses of Capital\nSystem Energy requires capital resources for:\n•\nconstruction and other capital investments;\n•\ndebt maturities or retirements;\n•\nworking capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs and tax payments; and\n•\ndividend, distribution, and interest payments.\nFollowing are the amounts of System Energy’s planned construction and other capital investments.\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n \n(In Millions)\nPlanned construction and capital investment:\n \nGeneration\n$115 \n$140 \n$110 \nUtility Support\n25 \n5 \n5 \nTotal\n$140 \n$145 \n$115 \nIn addition to routine spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate includes amounts associated with Grand Gulf investments and initiatives.

System Energy is not able to predict the effect of potential changes in regulation and law, changes to governmental programs, such as loans, grants, guarantees, and other subsidies, and trade-related governmental actions, such as tariffs and other measures, on its current and planned capital projects.\nFollowing are the amounts of System Energy’s existing debt obligations (includes estimated interest payments).\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028-2029\nAfter 2029\n \n(In Millions)\nLong-term debt (a)\n$269 \n$65 \n$224 \n$407 \n$611 \n(a)\nLong-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.\nOther Obligations\nSystem Energy currently expects to contribute approximately $15.7 million to its qualified pension plans and approximately $34 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2025, although the 2025 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2025, valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2025.  See “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \n– Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” below and Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.\nSystem Energy has no unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the\n timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn addition, System Energy enters into nuclear fuel purchase agreements that contain minimum purchase obligations.  As discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements, System Energy recovers these costs through charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.\nAs a wholly-owned subsidiary, System Energy dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly.\nSources of Capital\nSystem Energy’s sources to meet its capital requirements include:\n•\ninternally generated funds;\n•\ncash on hand;\n•\nthe Entergy system money pool;\n•\ndebt issuances, including debt issuances to refund or retire currently outstanding or maturing indebtedness; \n•\nequity contributions; and\n•\nbank financing under new or existing facilities.\nCircumstances such fuel and purchased power price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future.  In addition to the financings necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, System Energy expects to \n445\nTable of Contents\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc.\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\ncontinue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost debt and replace it with lower-cost debt if market conditions permit.\nAll debt issuances by System Energy require prior regulatory approval.  Debt issuances are also subject to requirements set forth in its bond indenture and other agreements.  System Energy has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\nSystem Energy’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years.\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n(In Thousands)\n$2,851\n($12,246)\n$94,981\n$75,745\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.\nThe System Energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity has a credit facility in the amount of $120 million scheduled to expire in June 2027.  As of December 31, 2024, $72.7 million in loans were outstanding under the System Energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity credit facility.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the variable interest entity credit facility.\nSystem Energy obtained authorizations from the FERC through January 2027 for the following:\n•\nshort-term borrowings not to exceed an aggregate amount of $200 million at any time outstanding;\n•\nlong-term borrowings and security issuances not to exceed an aggregate amount of $1.4 billion at any time outstanding; and\n•\nborrowings by its nuclear fuel company variable interest entity.\nSee Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of System Energy’s short-term borrowing limits.\nFederal Regulation\nSee the “\nRate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation\n \n– Federal Regulation\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation.\nComplaints Against System Energy\nSystem Energy’s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf.  System Energy sells its Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  System Energy and the Unit Power Sales Agreement have been the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including challenges with respect to System Energy’s authorized return on equity and capital structure, renewal of its sale-leaseback arrangement, treatment of uncertain tax positions, a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, and two prudence complaints, one challenging the extended power uprate completed at Grand Gulf in 2012 and the operation and management of Grand Gulf, particularly in the 2016-2020 time period, and the second challenging the operation and management of Grand Gulf in the 2021-2022 time period.  Settlements that resolve all significant aspects of these complaints have been reached with the MPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and the LPSC, and these settlements have been approved by the FERC.  \nSee “\nComplaints Against System Energy\n” in Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of these complaint proceedings and settlements.\n446\nTable of Contents\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc.\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nUnit Power Sales Agreement\nSystem Energy Formula Rate Annual Protocols Formal Challenge Concerning 2020 Calendar Year Bills\nSystem Energy’s Unit Power Sales Agreement includes formula rate protocols that provide for the disclosure of cost inputs, an opportunity for informal discovery procedures, and a challenge process.  In February 2022, pursuant to the protocols procedures, the LPSC, the APSC, the MPSC, the City Council, and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed with the FERC a formal challenge to System Energy’s implementation of the formula rate during calendar year 2020.  This formal challenge was ultimately settled as a result of System Energy’s global settlements with the MPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and the LPSC.  See “\nComplaints Against System Energy\n” in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the System Energy settlements with the MPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and the LPSC.\nSystem Energy Formula Rate Annual Protocols Formal Challenge Concerning 2021 Calendar Year Bills\nIn March 2023, pursuant to the protocols procedures discussed above, the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council filed with the FERC a formal challenge to System Energy’s implementation of the formula rate during calendar year 2021.  This formal challenge was ultimately settled as a result of System Energy’s global settlements with the MPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and the LPSC.  See “\nComplaints Against System Energy\n” in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the System Energy settlements with the MPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and the LPSC.\nSystem Energy Formula Rate Annual Protocols Formal Challenge Concerning 2022 Calendar Year Bills\nIn February 2024, pursuant to the protocols procedures, the LPSC and the City Council filed with the FERC a formal challenge to System Energy’s implementation of the formula rate during calendar year 2022.  This formal challenge was ultimately settled as a result of System Energy’s global settlements with the MPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and the LPSC.  See “\nComplaints Against System Energy\n” in Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the System Energy settlements with the MPSC, the APSC, the City Council, and the LPSC.\nDepreciation Amendment Proceeding\nIn December 2021, System Energy submitted to the FERC proposed amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement to adopt updated rates for use in calculating Grand Gulf plant depreciation and amortization expenses.  The proposed amendments would result in higher charges to the Utility operating companies that buy capacity and energy from System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  In February 2022 the FERC accepted System Energy’s proposed increased depreciation rates with an effective date of March 1, 2022, subject to refund pending the outcome of the settlement and/or hearing procedures.  In June 2023 System Energy filed with the FERC an unopposed offer of settlement that it had negotiated with intervenors to the proceeding.  In August 2023 the FERC approved the settlement, which resolves the proceeding.  In third quarter 2023, System Energy recorded a reduction in depreciation expense of $41 million representing the cumulative difference in depreciation expense resulting from the depreciation rates used from March 2022 through June 2023 and the depreciation rates included in the settlement filing approved by the FERC.  In October 2023, System Energy filed a refund report with the FERC.  The refund provided for in the refund report was included in the September 2023 service month bills under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.  No comments or protests to the refund report were filed.\nPension Costs Amendment Proceeding\nIn October 2021, System Energy submitted to the FERC proposed amendments to the Unit Power Sales Agreement to include in rate base the prepaid and accrued pension costs associated with System Energy’s qualified pension plans.  Based on data ending in 2020, the increased annual revenue requirement associated with the filing is approximately $8.9 million.  In March 2022 the FERC accepted System Energy’s proposed amendments with an \n447\nTable of Contents\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc.\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\neffective date of December 1, 2021, subject to refund pending the outcome of the settlement and/or hearing procedures.  In August 2023 the FERC chief ALJ terminated settlement procedures and designated a presiding ALJ to oversee hearing procedures.  Testimony was filed by the parties from October 2023 through April 2024, and the hearing concluded in June 2024.\nIn September 2024 the presiding ALJ issued an initial decision recommending that t\nhe FERC appro\nve inclusion of a line item in rate base for prepaid and accrued pension costs; however, the presiding ALJ did not agree with System Energy’s proposed methodology to calculate the value of the prepaid and accrued pension cost input.  Instead, the presiding ALJ recommended limiting System Energy’s recovery to the prepaid and accrued pension costs that were incurred beginning in 2015 and later.\nSystem Energy disputes the presiding ALJ's determination concerning the methodology used to calculate the prepaid and accrued pension input, and System Energy filed exceptions to these rulings in October 2024.  In October 2024, the LPSC, the APSC, and the FERC trial staff filed separate briefs on exceptions; these parties generally argue that the presiding ALJ should have rejected System Energy’s filing entirely, rather than limit System Energy’s recovery of the prepaid and accrued pension costs.  Later in October 2024, System Energy, the LPSC, the APSC, and the FERC trial staff filed separate briefs opposing exceptions.\nIf the ALJ’s determination is affirmed by the FERC, System Energy estimates refunds, including interest through December 31, 2024, of approximat\nely $16 million to $21 million would be owed.  The ALJ's initial decision is not binding on the FERC and is an interim step in the hearing process.  No refunds will be owed in connection with this proc\needing and no changes to System Energy’s pension cost recovery methodology will be implemented unless and until the FERC requires them in a final order.  This proceeding is not covered by the global settlements described above.\nNuclear Matters\nSystem Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates the Grand Gulf nuclear generating plant and is, therefore, subject to the risks related to such ownership and operation.  These include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues related to equipment reliability, to position Grand Gulf to meet its operational goals; the performance and capacity factors of Grand Gulf; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license amendments, and decommissioning; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of the site when required; and limitations on the amounts of insurance recoveries for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident.  In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Grand Gulf, System Energy may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.  Grand Gulf’s operating license expires in 2044.\nEnvironmental Risks\nSystem Energy’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes that System Energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in “\nRegulation of Entergy’s Business\n - \nEnvironmental Regulation\n” in Part I, Item 1.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.\n448\nTable of Contents\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc.\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of System Energy’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in these assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of System Energy’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNuclear Decommissioning Costs\nSee “\nNuclear Decommissioning Costs\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\nSee “\nUtility Regulatory Accounting\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation.\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\nSee “\nTaxation and Uncertain Tax Positions\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nSystem Energy’s qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are affected by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  See “\nQualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.\nCost Sensitivity\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Qualified Pension Cost\nImpact on 2024 Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$216\n$6,204\nRate of return on plan assets\n(0.25%)\n$671\n$—\nRate of increase in compensation\n0.25%\n$264\n$1,306\n449\nTable of Contents\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc.\nManagement’s Financial Discussion and Analysis\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefits cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands).\nActuarial Assumption\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on 2025 Postretirement Benefits Cost\nImpact on 2024 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation\n \n \nIncrease/(Decrease)\n \nDiscount rate\n(0.25%)\n$27\n$773\nHealth care cost trend\n0.25%\n$52\n$550\nEach fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.\nCosts and Employer Contributions\nTotal qualified pension cost for System Energy in 2024 was $5.8 million, including $615 thousand in settlement costs.  System Energy anticipates 2025 qualified pension cost to be $6 million.  System Energy contributed $16.7 million to its qualified pension plans in 2024 and estimates 2025 pension contributions will be approximately $15.7 million, although the 2025 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the January 1, 2025 valuations are completed, which is expected by April 1, 2025.\nTotal postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for System Energy in 2024 was $913 thousand.  System Energy expects 2025 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income to approximate $855 thousand.  System Energy contributed $741 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2024 and expects 2025 contributions to approximate $34 thousand.\nOther Contingencies\nSee “\nOther Contingencies\n” in the “\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the estimates associated with environmental, litigation, and other risks.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee the “\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n” section of Note 1 to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.\n450\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholder and Board of Directors of\nSystem Energy Resources, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of System Energy Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in common equity (pages \n453\n through \n458\n and applicable items in pages \n47\n through 239), for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that is material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRate and Regulatory Matters\n — \nSystem Energy Resources, Inc.\n — \nRefer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to wholesale rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.  \nThe Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight.  Because the FERC sets the rates the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable \n451\nTable of Contents\nreturn on equity, the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities.  The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the FERC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the (1) likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and the (2) likelihood of refunds to customers. Auditing management’s judgments regarding the outcome of future decisions by the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities involved specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and auditor judgment to evaluate management estimates and the subjectivity of audit evidence.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the FERC, recovery in future rates of regulatory assets and refunds or future reductions in rates related to regulatory liabilities included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the FERC for the Company to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the FERC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s and intervenors’ filings with the FERC, initial Administrative Law Judge decisions and FERC orders issued, and settlement offers and agreements with the FERC for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions\n.\n•\nWe obtained an analysis from management and support from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or refund or a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe obtained representation from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nFebruary 18, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001.\n452\nTable of Contents\nSYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC.\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In Thousands)\nOPERATING REVENUES\n \n \n \nElectric\n$\n585,049\n \n$\n586,603\n \n$\n658,812\n \nOPERATING EXPENSES\n \n \n \nOperation and Maintenance:\n \n \n \nFuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale\n62,433\n \n71,762\n \n50,216\n \nNuclear refueling outage expenses\n19,158\n \n26,745\n \n24,482\n \nOther operation and maintenance\n192,300\n \n207,765\n \n226,557\n \nDecommissioning\n43,478\n \n41,773\n \n40,235\n \nTaxes other than income taxes\n27,260\n \n29,224\n \n29,428\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n121,386\n \n90,858\n \n111,889\n \nOther regulatory charges (credits) -

Under this physical- and cyber-risk model, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries streamline security into a centralized program.\n  The Chief Security Officer (CSO) is responsible for establishing the security and reliability risk strategy, setting policies, monitoring controls and compliance, providing support activities, and reporting on the security program.  The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for establishing the cybersecurity strategy and implementing physical and cyber security systems for the security program.  The Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for ensuring that Entergy’s information technology infrastructure is secure and reliable.  The Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer works with the CSO to address requirements of external security-related regulations, and where applicable, incorporate them into business policies.  Management is responsible for identifying and managing risk directly through execution of the security program and compliance with security policies.\n  Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries’ risk management model addresses compliance with certain regulatory constructs, such as the NERC Reliability Standards, the NRC Code of Federal Regulations, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, among other regulations.  Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries’ risk management model continuously evolves to improve and implement protections, controls, and monitoring to mitigate risks to their part of North America’s electric grid, to protect sensitive information, and to maintain secure business operations.  Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries manage cybersecurity threats as an enterprise risk with close coordination and information sharing with its federal, state, and local partners.  Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries also engage with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies on initiatives to share threat information and participate in a wide range of industry collaborations and classified briefings on cybersecurity developments and evolving risks.\nEntergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries maintain access-management controls, including a layered multi-factor authentication process for network and system access, and a defense-in-depth security ecosystem that includes advanced threat detection from independent third parties and federal agencies, security logging and monitoring, and independent third-party penetration and vulnerability assessments.\n  Relevant employees and contractors must complete cybersecurity trainings periodically to heighten security and threat awareness, promote best practices, and meet regulatory requirements.  Additional multi-layered prevention and detection processes and technologies to mitigate and minimize the effects of cybersecurity risks include email security, continuous monitoring, vulnerability scanning, anti-virus and anti-malware software, backups and recovery strategy, network segregation, third-party security, and information protection.\nEntergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries have incorporated certain cyber-specific response protocols and procedures into their Entergy Incident Management System framework for responding to emergency incidents.  This includes the Entergy Incident Response Team Plan, which outlines Entergy’s procedures, steps, and responsibilities for preparing for, detecting, containing, and recovering from an incident.  The plan details the roles and responsibilities of Entergy’s officers who would be engaged in such a response to an emergency incident, \n315\nTable of Contents\nPart I",
