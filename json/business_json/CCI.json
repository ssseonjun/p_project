Changes in working capital contribute to variability in net cash provided by operating activities, largely due to the timing of advanced payments by us and advanced receipts from tenants. We expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future (exclusive of changes in working capital) if we realize expected growth in our core business.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities for 2024 decreased by $299 million from 2023 primarily as a result of a decrease in  discretionary capital expenditures in both our Towers and Fiber segments and a decrease in payments for acquisitions in our Towers segment.\nOur capital expenditures are categorized as discretionary or sustaining as described below.\n•\nDiscretionary capital expenditures are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects. The expansion or development of existing communications infrastructure to accommodate new leasing typically varies based on, among other factors: (1) the type of communications infrastructure, (2) the scope, volume, and mix of work performed on the communications infrastructure, (3) existing capacity prior to installation, or (4) changes in structural engineering regulations and standards. Currently, construction of new communications infrastructure is predominately comprised of the construction of small cells and fiber (including certain construction projects that may take 18 to 36 months to complete). Our decisions regarding discretionary capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash, such as payments of dividends and investments. \n41\n•\nSustaining capital expenditures consist of those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as discretionary capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures.\nA summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In millions of dollars)\nTowers\nFiber\nOther\nTotal\nTowers\nFiber\nOther\nTotal\nTowers\nFiber\nOther\nTotal\nDiscretionary:\nCommunications infrastructure improvements and other capital projects\n(a)\n$\n65 \n$\n992 \n$\n20 \n$\n1,077 \n$\n122 \n$\n1,131 \n$\n24 \n$\n1,277 \n$\n121 \n$\n1,017 \n$\n24 \n$\n1,162 \nPurchases of land interests\n58 \n— \n— \n58 \n64 \n— \n— \n64 \n53 \n— \n— \n53 \nSustaining\n10 \n53 \n24 \n87 \n8 \n44 \n31 \n83 \n11 \n41 \n43 \n95 \nTotal\n$\n133 \n$\n1,045 \n$\n44 \n$\n1,222 \n$\n194 \n$\n1,175 \n$\n55 \n$\n1,424 \n$\n185 \n$\n1,058 \n$\n67 \n$\n1,310 \n \n(a)\nTowers segment includes $12 million, $32 million and $48 million of capital expenditures incurred during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with tenant installations and upgrades on our towers.\nThe reduction in discretionary capital expenditures for the Fiber segment was primarily related to the higher return thresholds on new growth opportunities in the Fiber segment as a result of the Fiber operating review completed in the second quarter of 2024, while the reduction in discretionary capital expenditures for the Towers segment was primarily impacted by the discontinuation of installation services as a Towers product offering and the timing of Towers tenant activity during full year 2024 compared to full year 2023. See \n\"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Outlook Highlights\"\n for a discussion of our expectations surrounding 2025 capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nWe seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance long-term stockholder value, which may include various financing activities such as (in no particular order): (1) paying dividends on our common stock, subject to declaration by our board of directors, (2) purchasing our common stock or (3) purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. See \n\"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview—Common Stock Dividend,\"\n \n\"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Overview\" \nand notes 7, 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. \nIn 2024, our financing activities predominately related to the following: \n•\npaying an aggregate of $2.7 billion in dividends on our common stock;\n•\nrepaying in full the previously outstanding 3.200% senior unsecured notes on the contractual maturity date in September 2024; and\n•\nissuing $550 million aggregate principal amount of 4.900% senior unsecured notes and $700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.200% senior unsecured notes in August 2024, the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our CP Program and pay related fees and expenses.\nIn 2023, our financing activities predominately related to the following:\n•\npaying an aggregate of $2.7 billion in dividends on our common stock;\n•\nissuing $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in December 2023, the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our CP Program and pay related fees and expenses;\n•\nrepaying in full the previously outstanding 3.150% senior unsecured notes on the contractual maturity date in July 2023;\n•\nissuing $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.800% senior unsecured notes and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.100% senior unsecured notes in April 2023, the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2016 Revolver and pay related fees and expenses; and\n•\nissuing $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in January 2023, the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2016 Revolver and pay related fees and expenses.\nIncurrence, Purchases and Repayments of Debt.\n See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, \n\"Item 7. MD&A—General Overview\" and \"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Overview—Liquidity Position\" \nfor further discussion of our recent issuances, purchases, redemptions and repayments of debt.\n42\nCommon Stock. \nSee notes 10 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our common stock as well as dividends declared and paid. \nATM Program. \nWe previously maintained a 2021 ATM Program through which we had the right to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million to or through sales agents.  In March 2024, we terminated the formerly outstanding 2021 ATM Program with the entire gross sales price of $750 million remaining unsold.\nIn March 2024, we established the 2024 ATM Program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750 million. Sales under the 2024 ATM Program, or any similar successor program, may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds from any sales under the 2024 ATM Program, or any similar successor program, for general corporate purposes, which may include (1) the funding of future acquisitions or investments or (2) the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness. We have not sold any shares of common stock under the 2024 ATM Program. See also note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. As of March 12, 2025, we had $750 million of gross sales of common stock availability remaining on our 2024 ATM Program. \nCredit Facility.\n See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our 2016 Credit Facility. As of March 12, 2025, we did not have an outstanding balance under our 2016 Revolver and maintained $7.0 billion in undrawn availability. The proceeds from our 2016 Revolver may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, acquisitions, the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness and purchases of our common stock.\nCommercial Paper Program. \nSee note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our CP Program. As of March 12, 2025, there was $1.1 billion outstanding under our CP Program. The proceeds from our Commercial Paper Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, acquisitions, the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness and purchases of our common stock.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\n. Pursuant to the indentures governing certain of our operating companies' debt securities, all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee. The restricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures. See also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\n43\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe following table summarizes our material cash requirements as of December 31, 2024. These material cash requirements relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings or lease obligations for land interests under our towers. The debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt (see footnote (b)).\n \n(In millions of dollars)\nYears Ending December 31,\nMaterial Cash Requirements\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotals\nDebt and other long-term obligations\n(a)\n$\n1,951 \n$\n2,787 \n$\n3,258 \n$\n2,635 \n$\n2,478 \n$\n11,130 \n$\n24,239 \nInterest payments on debt and other long-term obligations\n(b)(c)\n897 \n859 \n759 \n646 \n558 \n5,396 \n9,115 \nLease obligations\n(d)\n558 \n551 \n547 \n543 \n538 \n5,682 \n8,419 \nTotal material cash requirements\n$\n3,406 \n$\n4,197 \n$\n4,564 \n$\n3,824 \n$\n3,574 \n$\n22,208 \n$\n41,773 \n \n(a)\nThe impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of our Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and 2018-2 (collectively, \"Tower Revenue Notes\") is not considered. The Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 and 2018-2 have principal amounts of $700 million and $750 million, with anticipated repayment dates in 2025 and 2028, respectively. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our definition of and additional information regarding the Tower Revenue Notes.\n(b)\nIf the Tower Revenue Notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates, the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5% per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable Tower Revenue Notes) of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The Tower Revenue Notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2045 to 2048 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes. The full year 2024 Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes was approximately $1.0 billion. We currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates.\n(c)\nIncludes the unused commitment fees on our 2016 Credit Facility. Interest payments on the variable rate debt are based on estimated rates currently in effect. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding potential upward or downward adjustments to the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility if we achieve specified annual sustainability targets or fail to meet annual sustainability thresholds. Each annual period presented assumes the downward adjustments in the interest rate spread and unused commitment fee percentage on our 2016 Credit Facility. See \n\"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\"\n for a discussion of our interest rate risk.\n(d)\nAmounts relate primarily to lease obligations for the land on which our towers are located and are based on the assumption that payments will be made for certain renewal periods exercisable at our option that are reasonably certain to be exercised and excludes our contingent payments for operating leases (such as payments based on revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset) as such arrangements are excluded from our operating lease liability. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating lease obligations. See also the table below summarizing remaining terms to expiration.\n44\nThe following chart summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers, including renewal terms exercisable at our option, as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life of approximately 35 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. See \n\"",
    "item1a": "Item 1a. Risk Factors\"\n for a further discussion of risks stemming from interest rate increases.\nSensitivity Analysis. \nWe manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2024, we had $2.5 billion of floating rate debt. A hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing floating rate debt of 1/4 of a percent point over a 12-month period would increase our interest expense by approximately $6 million.\nPotential Future Borrowings of Incremental Debt. \nWe typically do not hedge our exposure to interest rates on potential future borrowings of incremental debt for a substantial period prior to issuance. See \n\"Item 7. MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources\"\n regarding our liquidity strategy.\nPotential Refinancing of Existing Debt. \nOur contractual debt maturities over the next 12 months consist of Commercial Paper Notes that may be outstanding from time to time, the 1.350% Senior Notes and principal payments on certain outstanding debt. We currently expect to refinance the Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2 on or prior to the anticipated repayment date of May 15, 2025. See below for additional discussion as well as a tabular presentation of our scheduled contractual debt maturities as of December 31, 2024.\n54\nFuture Principal Payments and Interest Rates\nThe following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates. The future principal payments and weighted-average interest rates are presented as of December 31, 2024. These debt maturities reflect final maturity dates, and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of certain debt (see footnotes (b) and (d)).

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n57\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition - Towers Segment - Site Rental Revenues\nAs described in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized $4,266 million in site rental revenues from the Towers segment for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company generates site rental revenues from its core business by providing tenants with access to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term tenant contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements. Providing such access over the length of the tenant contract term represents the Company’s sole performance obligation under its tenant contracts. Site rental revenues from the Company's tenant contracts are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for the site rental revenues from the Towers segment is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to revenue recognition for the site rental revenues from the Towers segment.  \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to revenue recognition for the site rental revenues from the Towers segment. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s identification of the contractual terms by obtaining and inspecting tenant contracts and other relevant source documents on a test basis and (ii) testing the appropriateness of the amount of revenue recognized based on contractual terms on a test basis.  \nQuantitative Goodwill Impairment Test – Fiber Reporting Unit\nAs described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $5,127 million as of December 31, 2024. Management tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to such excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Management performed the most recent annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2024. The quantitative impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company’s Fiber reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As such, management recorded an impairment charge of $4,958 million, which resulted in no goodwill remaining for the Fiber reporting unit. The means of estimating the fair value of the Company’s reporting units is using discounted cash flow (DCF) models developed by management. Key assumptions and estimates used in the DCF models included projected future revenues, operating cash flows, capital expenditures (net of certain payments received from customers), an exit multiple and a discount rate. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the quantitative goodwill impairment test of the Fiber reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Fiber reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing the procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the exit multiple and  discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s quantitative goodwill impairment test, including controls over the valuation of the Fiber reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Fiber reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the DCF model used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the DCF model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant \n58\nassumptions related to the exit multiple and discount rate. Evaluating management's assumption related to the exit multiple involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was reasonable considering the consistency with external market and industry data. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of (i) the appropriateness of the DCF model and (ii) the reasonableness of the exit multiple and discount rate assumptions.  \n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nMarch 14, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2011.\n59\nCROWN CASTLE INC.

As used herein, the term \"including,\" and any variation thereof, means \"including without limitation.\" The use of the word \"or\" herein is not exclusive. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references to \"U.S.\" are to the United States of America and Puerto Rico, collectively.\nThe Company owns, operates and leases shared communications infrastructure that is geographically dispersed throughout the U.S., including (1) towers and other structures, such as rooftops (collectively, \"towers\"), and (2) fiber primarily supporting small cell networks (\"small cells\") and fiber solutions. The Company's towers, small cells and fiber assets are collectively referred to herein as \"communications infrastructure,\" and the Company's customers on its communications infrastructure are referred to herein as \"tenants.\" \nThe Company's core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements (collectively, \"tenant contracts\"). \nThe Company's operating segments consist of (1) Towers and (2) Fiber. See note 14.\nOn March 13, 2025, the Company signed a definitive agreement (“Strategic Fiber Agreement”) to sell its Fiber segment, together with certain supporting assets and personnel (\"Fiber Business\"), with Zayo Group Holdings Inc. (\"Zayo\") acquiring the fiber solutions business and EQT Active Core Infrastructure fund (\"EQT\") acquiring the small cell business (\"Strategic Fiber Transaction\").  The Fiber Business did not meet the criteria for assets held for sale as of December 31, 2024, and therefore remains presented as a component of continuing operations.  As a result, this document, unless otherwise noted, does not contemplate the planned sale of the Fiber Business.  In subsequent periods, the Fiber Business will be presented as a discontinued operation, and its net assets will be classified as held for sale and comparable prior periods will be recast to reflect this change. See note 17.\nApproximately \n54\n% of the Company's towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, and other agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile (including those which T-Mobile assumed in its merger with Sprint). The Company has the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. The Company has no obligation to exercise such purchase options. See notes 4 and 13.\nAs part of the Company's effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, the Company also offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment.  For the periods presented, such services predominately consisted of (1) site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations, including: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting (collectively, \"site development services\") and (2) tenant equipment installation and subsequent augmentations (collectively, \"installation services\"). \nSee note 16 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of (1) the Company's July 2023 restructuring plan (\"2023 Restructuring Plan\"), which included discontinuing installation services as a Towers product offering and (2) the Company's June 2024 restructuring plan (\"2024 Restructuring Plan,\" and together with the 2023 Restructuring Plan, \"Restructuring Plans\").\nThe Company operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Company has certain taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\"). See note 9.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \n2.    \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\n \n64\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents represents (1) the cash held in reserve by the indenture trustees pursuant to the indenture governing certain of the Company's debt instruments, (2) cash securing performance obligations such as letters of credit and (3) any other cash whose use is limited by contractual provisions. The restriction of rental cash receipts is a critical feature of certain of the Company's debt instruments due to the applicable indenture trustee's ability to utilize the restricted cash for the payment of (1) debt service costs, (2) ground rents, (3) real estate or personal property taxes, (4) insurance premiums related to towers, (5) other assessments by governmental authorities and potential environmental remediation costs or (6) a portion of advance rents from tenants. The restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to the Company in accordance with the terms of the indentures. See note 15 for a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.\nReceivables Allowance\nAn allowance for credit losses is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable. The Company uses judgment in estimating this allowance and considers historical collections, current credit status, or contractual provisions. Additions to the allowance for credit losses are charged either to \"Site rental costs of operations\" or to \"Services and other costs of operations,\" as appropriate, and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible.\nLease Accounting\nGeneral.\n The Company evaluates whether a contract meets the definition of a lease whenever a contract grants a party the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To the extent the identified asset is able to be shared among multiple parties, the Company has determined that one party does not have control of the identified asset and the contract is not considered a lease. The Company accounts for contracts that do not meet the definition of a lease under other relevant accounting guidance (such as ASC 606 for revenue from contracts with customers).\nLessee. \nFor its Tower segment, the Company's lessee arrangements primarily consist of ground leases for land under towers. Ground leases for land are specific to each site, generally contain an initial term between \nfive\n to \n15\n years and are renewable (and cancellable after a notice period) at the Company's option. The Company also enters into term ground leases, such as term easements, in which it prepays the entire term. For its Fiber segment, the Company's lessee arrangements primarily include leases of fiber assets to support the Company's small cells and fiber solutions.\nThe majority of the Company's lease agreements have certain termination rights that provide for cancellation after a notice period and multiple renewal options exercisable at the Company's option. The Company includes renewal option periods in its calculation of the estimated lease term when it determines the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. When such renewal options are deemed to be reasonably certain, the estimated lease term determined under ASC 842 will be greater than the non-cancelable term of the contractual arrangement. Although certain renewal periods are included in the estimated lease term, the Company would have the ability to terminate or elect to not renew a particular lease if business conditions warrant such a decision.\nThe Company classifies its lessee arrangements at inception as either operating leases or finance leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if at least one of the following criteria is met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee, (2) the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (4) the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset, or (5) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if none of the five criteria described above for finance lease classification is met. \nRight-of-use (\"ROU\") assets associated with operating leases are included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Current and long-term portions of lease liabilities related to operating leases are included in \"Current portion of operating lease liabilities\" and \"Operating lease liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, respectively. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the estimated lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's present value of its future lease payments. In assessing its leases and determining its lease liability at lease commencement or upon modification, the Company is not able to readily determine the rate implicit for its lessee arrangements, and thus uses its incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company's ROU assets are measured as the balance of the lease liability plus any prepaid or accrued lease payments and any unamortized initial direct costs. For both the Towers and Fiber segments, operating lease expenses are recognized on a ratable basis, regardless of whether the payment terms require the Company to make payments annually, semi-\n65\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nannually, quarterly, monthly, or for the entire term in advance. Certain of the Company's ground lease and fiber lease agreements contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in consumer price index (\"CPI\")). If the payment terms include fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company calculates the straight-line expense over the contract's estimated lease term, including any renewal option periods that the Company deems reasonably certain to be exercised.\nLease agreements may also contain provisions for a contingent payment based on (1) the revenues derived from the communications infrastructure located on the leased asset, (2) the change in CPI or (3) the usage of the leased asset. The Company's contingent payments are considered variable lease payments and are (1) not included in the initial measurement of the ROU asset or lease liability due to the uncertainty of the payment amount and (2) recorded as expense in the period such contingencies are resolved.\nROU assets associated with finance leases are included in \"Property and equipment, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Lease liabilities associated with finance leases are included in \"Current maturities of debt and other obligations\" and \"Debt and other long-term obligations\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. For both its Towers and Fiber segments, the Company measures the lease liability for finance leases using the effective interest method. The initial lease liability is increased to reflect interest on the liability and decreased to reflect payments made during the period. Interest on the lease liability is determined each period during the lease term as the amount that results in a constant periodic discount rate on the remaining balance of the liability. The Company depreciates ROU assets for finance leases on a ratable basis over the applicable lease term.\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of its ROU assets for impairment, similar to its other long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company could record impairments in the future if there are changes in (1) long-term market conditions, (2) expected future operating results or (3) the utility of the assets that negatively impact the fair value of its ROU assets.\nLessor.\n The Company's lessor arrangements primarily include tenant contracts for dedicated space (including dedicated fiber) on its shared communications infrastructure. The Company classifies its leases at inception as operating, direct financing or sales-type leases. A lease is classified as a sales-type lease if at least one of the following criteria is met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee, (2) the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (4) the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying assets or (5) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. Furthermore, when none of the above criteria is met, a lease is classified as a direct financing lease if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the present value of the of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee, that is not already reflected in the lease payments, equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying asset and (2) it is probable that the lessor will collect the lease payments plus any amount necessary to satisfy a residual value guarantee. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not qualify as a sales-type or direct financing lease. Currently, the Company classifies all of its lessor arrangements as operating leases.\nSite rental revenues from the Company’s lessor arrangements are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of a tenant contract. Certain of the Company's tenant contracts contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed-dollar or fixed-percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in CPI). If the payment terms call for fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the agreement. When calculating straight-line site rental revenues, the Company considers all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions. \nCertain of the Company's arrangements with tenants in its Fiber segment contain both lease and non-lease components. In such circumstances, the Company has determined (1) the timing and pattern of transfer for the lease and non-lease component are the same and (2) the stand-alone lease component would be classified as an operating lease. As such, the Company has aggregated certain non-lease components with lease components and has determined that the lease components (generally dedicated fiber) represent the predominant component of the arrangement.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment includes land owned through fee interests and perpetual easements, which have no definite life. Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line \n66\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nmethod at rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets. Depreciation for the majority of communications infrastructure is computed with a useful life equal to the shorter of \n20\n years or the term of the underlying ground lease (where applicable and including optional renewal periods). Additions and permanent improvements to the Company's communications infrastructure are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed.\nLabor and interest costs incurred directly related to the construction of certain property and equipment are capitalized during the construction phase of projects. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $\n298\n million, $\n299\n million and $\n265\n million in capitalized labor costs, respectively. The carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.\nAbandonments and write-offs of property and equipment are recorded to \"Asset write-down charges\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and were $\n146\n million, $\n40\n million and $\n39\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in asset write-down charges from 2023 to 2024 is primarily driven by the cancellation of approximately \n7,000\n greenfield small cell nodes in the Company's contracted backlog that it mutually agreed to cancel following discussions with certain of its tenants. The Company wrote off property and equipment deemed to have no alternative future use, and as a result, recognized approximately $\n106\n million as \"Asset write-down charges\" on its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nPursuant to its ground lease, leased facility and certain pole attachment agreements, the Company records obligations to perform asset retirement activities, including requirements to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space on which certain of its communications infrastructure is located. The Company does not record an obligation for asset retirement activities related to its fiber, as a settlement date is indeterminable and therefore a reasonable estimation of fair value cannot be made. Asset retirement obligations are included in \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The liability accretes as a result of the passage of time and the related accretion expense is included in \"Depreciation, amortization and accretion\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as an additional carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the useful life of such asset.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price for an acquired business over the allocated value of the related net assets. Management tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units. The Company's reporting units are the same as its operating segments (Towers and Fiber). The Company then performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes it is \"more likely than not\" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to such excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company performed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2024, which resulted in an impairment of $\n5.0\n billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 to its Fiber reporting unit. With respect to the Towers reporting unit, there was no indication of impairment following the quantitative assessment, as the estimated fair value was well in excess of the corresponding carrying value. See note 5 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are included in \"Site rental contracts and tenant relationships, net\" and \"Other intangible assets, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and predominately consist of the estimated fair value of site rental contracts and tenant relationships or other contractual rights, such as trademarks, that are recorded in conjunction with acquisitions. Site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are comprised of (1) the current term of the existing leases, (2) the high rate of tenant retention, and (3) any associated relationships that are expected to generate value following the expiration of all renewal periods under existing leases. \n67\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe useful lives of intangible assets are estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit the Company and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate. Amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets. The useful lives of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are limited by the maximum depreciable life of the communications infrastructure (\n20\n years), as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and the site rental contracts and tenant relationships. In contrast, the site rental contracts and tenant relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of tenant retention experienced to date. Thus, while site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and tenant relationships, which includes assumptions regarding both (1) tenants' exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and (2) renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options, site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets are amortized over a period not to exceed \n20\n years. \nThe carrying value of other intangible assets with finite useful lives will be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company has a dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets. First, the Company pools site rental contracts and tenant relationships intangible assets with the related communications infrastructure assets into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing. Second and separately, the Company pools the site rental contracts and tenant relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate. If the sum of the associated estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss may be recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset.\nDeferred Credits\nDeferred credits are included in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and consist of the estimated fair value of below-market tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on acquired communications infrastructure that are amortized to site rental revenues.  \nFair value for these deferred credits represents the difference between (1) the stated contractual payments to be made pursuant to the in-place lease and (2) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding lease. Deferred credits are measured over a period equal to the estimated remaining economic lease term considering renewal provisions or economics associated with those renewal provisions, to the extent applicable. Deferred credits are amortized over their respected estimated lease terms at the time of acquisition, the most recent of which took place in 2017.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nThird-party costs incurred to obtain financing, with the exception of costs incurred related to revolving lines of credit, are deferred and are included as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability in \"Debt and other long-term obligations\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are amortized using the effective interest yield methodology to \"Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, net\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) over the term of the related debt liability. Third party costs incurred to obtain financing through a revolving line of credit are deferred and are included in \"Other assets, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and are amortized using the effective interest yield methodology to \"Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, net\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) over the term of the 2016 Credit Agreement (as defined in note 7).\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates site rental revenues from its core business by providing tenants with access, including space or capacity, to its shared communications infrastructure via long-term tenant contracts in various forms, including lease, license, sublease and service agreements. Typically, providing such access over the length of the tenant contract term represents the Company’s sole performance obligation under its tenant contracts. \nSite Rental Revenues. \nSite rental revenues from the Company's tenant contracts are recognized on a straight-line, ratable basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant tenant contract, which generally ranges between \nfive\n to \n15\n years for wireless tenants and between \none\n to \n20\n years for fiber solutions tenants (including from organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands), regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts during the life of the tenant contract. Certain of the Company's tenant contracts contain (1) fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or \n68\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nfixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the CPI), (2) multiple renewal periods exercisable at the tenant's option and (3) only limited termination rights at the applicable tenant's option through the current term. If the payment terms call for fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the tenant contract. When calculating straight-line rental revenues, the Company considers all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. The Company's assets related to straight-line site rental revenues are recorded within \"Current portion of deferred site rental receivables\" and \"Deferred site rental receivables\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Amounts to which the Company has an unconditional right to payment, which are related to both satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations, are recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\nPayments Associated with Sprint Cancellations. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, site rental revenues include $\n5\n million and $\n170\n million, respectively, of payments in the Company's Fiber segment to satisfy the remaining rental obligations of certain canceled Sprint leases as a result of the T-Mobile US, Inc. and Sprint network consolidation. In connection with such canceled Sprint leases, the Company also recognized $\n59\n million of accelerated prepaid rent amortization in the Company's Fiber segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 that did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2024.\nServices and Other Revenues. \nAs part of the Company’s effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, as an ancillary business, the Company offers certain services primarily relating to its Towers segment.  For the periods presented, such services predominately consisted of (1) pre-construction site development services and (2) installation services. See note 16 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's July 2023 restructuring plan, which included discontinuing installation services as a Towers product offering. Upon contract commencement, the Company assesses its services to tenants and identifies performance obligations for each promise to provide a distinct service.\nThe Company may have multiple performance obligations for site development services, which primarily include: structural analysis, zoning, permitting and construction drawings. For each of these performance obligations, services revenues are recognized at completion of the applicable performance obligation, which represents the point at which the Company believes it has transferred goods or services to the tenant. The services revenue recognized is based on an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations in a respective tenant contract based on estimated standalone selling price. The volume and mix of site development services may vary among tenant contracts and may include a combination of some or all of the above performance obligations. Amounts are billed per contractual milestones, with payments generally due within \n45\n to \n90\n days, and generally do not contain variable-consideration provisions. \nThe transaction price for the Company's tower installation services consists of amounts for (1) permanent improvements to the Company's towers that represent a lease component and (2) the performance of the service. Amounts under the Company's tower installation service agreements that represent a lease component are recognized as site rental revenues on a straight-line basis over the length of the associated estimated lease term. For the performance of the installation service, the Company has one performance obligation, which is satisfied at the time of the applicable installation or augmentation and recognized as services and other revenues on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Since performance obligations are typically satisfied prior to receiving payment from tenants, the unconditional right to payment is recorded within \"Receivables, net\" on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Generally, the services the Company provides to its tenants have a duration of one year or less.\nAdditional Information on Revenues. \nAs of January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024, $\n2.1\n billion and $\n2.0\n billion of unrecognized revenues, respectively, were reported in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately $\n490\n million of the January 1, 2024 unrecognized revenues balance was recognized as revenues. As of January 1, 2023, $\n2.3\n billion of unrecognized revenues were reported in \"Deferred revenues\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately $\n631\n million of the January 1, 2023 unrecognized revenues balance was recognized as revenues.\nSee note 3 for further discussion regarding the Company’s revenues.\n69\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCosts of Operations\nApproximately \n40\n% of the Company's site rental costs of operations expenses consist of Towers ground lease expenses, and the remainder includes fiber access expenses, repairs and maintenance expenses, employee compensation or related benefit costs, property taxes, or utilities. Generally, the ground leases for land are specific to each site and are for an initial term of between \nfive\n to \n15\n years and are renewable for pre-determined periods. The Company also enters into ground leases, such as term easements, in which it prepays the entire term in advance. Fiber access expenses primarily consist of leases of fiber assets and other access agreements to facilitate the Company's communications infrastructure. \nGround lease and fiber access expenses are recognized on a ratable basis, regardless of whether the payment terms require the Company to make payments annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or for the entire term in advance. Certain of the Company's ground lease and fiber access agreements contain fixed escalation clauses (such as fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases) or inflation-based escalation clauses (such as those tied to the change in CPI). If the payment terms include fixed escalators, upfront payments, or rent-free periods, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis. When calculating straight-line ground lease and fiber access expenses, the Company considers all fixed elements of contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element in addition to a minimum. The Company's liability related to straight-line expense is included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The Company's assets related to prepaid agreements is included in \"Prepaid expenses\" and \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\nServices and other costs of operations predominately consist of third-party service providers such as contractors and professional services firms and, to a lesser extent, internal labor costs, associated with the Company's site development and installation services. See note 16 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's July 2023 restructuring plan, which included discontinuing installation services as a Towers product offering. The Company's costs incurred prior to the satisfaction of associated performance obligations of $\n31\n million and $\n44\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in \"Other current assets\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\nAcquisitions and Integration Costs\nDirect or incremental costs related to a potential or completed business combination transaction are expensed as incurred. Such costs are predominately comprised of severance, retention bonuses payable to employees of an acquired enterprise, temporary employees to assist with the integration of the acquired operations, fees paid for services (such as consulting, accounting, legal, or engineering reviews), and any other costs directly associated with the transaction. These business combination costs are included in \"Acquisition and integration costs\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For those transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price.\nStock-based Compensation Expense, Net\nRestricted Stock Units.\n The Company records stock-based compensation expense for unvested restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. The cumulative effect of a change in the estimated number of RSUs for which the requisite service is expected to be or has been rendered is recognized in the period of the change in the estimate. To the extent that the requisite service is rendered, compensation cost for accounting purposes is not reversed; rather, it is recognized regardless of whether or not the awards vest. A discussion of the Company's valuation techniques and related assumptions and estimates used to measure the Company's stock-based compensation expense is as follows:\nValuation.\n The fair value of RSUs without market conditions is determined based on the number of shares relating to such RSUs and the quoted price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of RSUs with market conditions granted using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Company's determination of the fair value of RSUs with market conditions on the date of grant is affected by its common stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex or subjective variables. The determination of fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation requires the input of subjective assumptions, and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results.\nAmortization Method.\n The Company amortizes the fair value of all RSUs on a straight-line basis for each separately vesting tranche of the award (graded vesting schedule) over the requisite service periods. \nExpected Volatility.\n The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of its common stock.\nExpected Dividend Rate.\n The expected dividend rate at the date of grant is based on the then-current dividend yield.\n70\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRisk-Free Rate.\n The Company bases the risk-free rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.\nForfeitures.\n The Company uses historical award forfeiture data and management's judgment about the future employee turnover rates to estimate the number of shares for which the requisite service period will not be rendered.\nInterest Expense and Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs, Net\nThe components of interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, net are as follows:\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest expense on debt obligations\n$\n920\n \n$\n836\n \n$\n685\n \nAmortization of deferred financing costs and adjustments on long-term debt\n32\n \n29\n \n26\n \nCapitalized interest\n(\n20\n)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n12\n)\nTotal\n$\n932\n \n$\n850\n \n$\n699\n \nThe Company amortizes deferred financing costs, discounts and premiums over the estimated term of the related borrowing using the effective interest yield method. Deferred financing costs and discounts are generally presented as a direct reduction to the related debt obligation on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\n \nAssets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nWe classify an asset as held for sale when the following criteria are met: (1) management with proper authority has approved and committed to a plan to sell, (2) the asset is available for immediate sale, (3) an active program to locate a buyer has commenced at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, (4) the sale of the asset is probable (5) transfer of the asset is expected to occur within one year, except in certain circumstances such as extended regulatory approval, and (6) it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.\nFurther, we classify the balances and results related to a disposal in discontinued operations if all of the following criteria are met: (1) the operations and cash flows of the disposal group can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the company, (2) the disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale and (3) the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. For businesses classified as discontinued operations, the associated balances included in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet and to discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss), respectively, for all periods presented. The gains or losses associated with the discontinued operation are also recorded in discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\n \nIncome Taxes\nThe Company operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, the Company is generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that it pays and therefore is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its net taxable income that is currently distributed to its stockholders. The Company may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on its income, including (1) taxes on any undistributed income and (2) taxes related to the TRSs. In addition, the Company could, under certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"), to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT. \nAdditionally, the Company has included in TRSs certain other assets and operations. Those TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located. The Company's foreign assets and operations (including its tower operations in Puerto Rico) are subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located, regardless of whether they are included in a TRS or not. For certain acquisitions by the REIT, the Company will be subject to a federal corporate level tax rate (currently \n21\n%) on any gain recognized from the sale of assets occurring within a specified period (generally 5 years) after the transfer date up to the amount of the built in gain that existed on the transfer date, which is based upon the fair market value of those assets in excess of the Company's tax basis on the transfer date. This gain can be offset by any remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\").\n71\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFor the Company's TRSs, the Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is \"more likely than not\" that the asset will not be realized. The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is \"more likely than not\" that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets each quarter and based upon projections of future taxable income, reversing deferred tax liabilities or other known events that are expected to affect future taxable income, records a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the \"more likely than not\" realization threshold. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based upon changes in facts and circumstances that impact the recoverability of the asset.\nThe Company recognizes a tax position if it is \"more likely than not\" that it will be sustained upon examination. The tax position is measured at the largest amount that is greater than \n50\n percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\n \nThe Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the benefit (provision) for income taxes. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has not recorded any material penalties related to its income tax positions. See note 9.\nPer Share Information\nBasic net income (loss), per common share, excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, diluted net income (loss), per common share, is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus any potential dilutive common share equivalents, including shares issuable upon the vesting of RSUs as determined under the treasury stock method.\nA reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations is shown in the table below. \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(\n3,903\n)\n$\n1,502\n \n$\n1,675\n \nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding (in millions):\nBasic weighted-average number of common stock outstanding\n434\n \n434\n \n433\n \nEffect of assumed dilution from potential issuance of common shares relating to RSUs\n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \nDiluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding\n434\n \n434\n \n434\n \nNet income (loss), per common share:\nBasic\n$\n(\n8.98\n)\n$\n3.46\n \n$\n3.87\n \nDiluted\n$\n(\n8.98\n)\n$\n3.46\n \n$\n3.86\n \nDividends/distributions declared per share of common stock\n$\n6.26\n \n$\n6.26\n \n$\n5.98\n \nFair Values\nThe Company's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy that ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are (1) Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active and accessible markets, (2) Level 2 — observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets but corroborated by market data, and (3) Level 3 — unobservable inputs and are not corroborated by market data. The Company evaluates fair value hierarchy level classifications quarterly, and transfers between levels are effective at the end of the quarterly period.\n72\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents approximate the carrying values. The Company determines the fair value of its debt securities based on indicative, non-binding quotes from brokers. Quotes from brokers require judgment and are based on the brokers' interpretation of market information, including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices or quotes from active markets if available. There were no changes since December 31, 2023 in the Company's valuation techniques used to measure fair values. See note 8 for a further discussion of fair values.\n \nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued new guidance, which became effective starting with the Company's 2024 Form 10-K, that is designed to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses. The Company adopted the guidance as of the effective date (i.e. for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023). The new guidance also expands interim segment disclosure requirements and requires disclosure of the position and title of the Company's chief operating decision-maker. The Company adopted the new segment guidance using a retrospective approach for each prior reporting period presented. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statement but resulted in expanded disclosure, primarily within its segment reporting footnote. See note 14 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued new guidance that enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures, primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. The guidance will be effective for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the guidance, including the impact on its financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued new guidance which requires disclosure of disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items in the notes to the financial statements for both annual and interim periods. The guidance will be effective for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2027, and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively, with early adoption permitted.

The means of estimating the fair value of the Company’s reporting units is using discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") models developed by management. \n \nKey assumptions and estimates used in the DCF models included projected future revenues, operating cash flows, capital expenditures (net of certain payments received from customers), an exit multiple and a discount rate.\n \nWith respect to the Towers reporting unit, there was no indication of impairment following the quantitative assessment, as the estimated fair value was well in excess of the corresponding carrying amount.\nThe quantitative impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's Fiber reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The impairment was due to a number of factors, one of which was a reduction in management’s assumptions for long-term revenue growth as actual demand, particularly related to small cells, has continued to be lower than previous expectations. In the face of this reduced demand, and consistent with the recently concluded operating review of the Fiber business, management implemented operational and strategic changes targeted at reducing future capital investment in the Fiber business by focusing primarily on colocation opportunities which require less capital expenditures than new-build opportunities.  Although this more targeted strategy is focused on higher-return projects, the lower capital investment is expected to result in lower overall revenues and operating cash flows in the Fiber business.  Following implementation of these changes, and consistent with the ongoing developments surrounding the Company's strategic review of its Fiber business, during the fourth quarter of 2024, management incorporated the anticipated impact of these changes in expectations into its long-term forecasts, which decreased the estimated fair value of the Fiber reporting unit. Additionally, management’s expectations regarding the terminal value of the projections decreased due to several factors, including lower operating cash flows forecasted by management in the terminal year as well as lower exit multiples derived from industry research firms' outlook reports, which management uses in its DCF models.  Finally, changes in the macroeconomic environment, including elevated interest rates, resulted in an increase in the discount rate used in the valuation model, which had a negative impact on estimated fair value.\nThe impairment charges for the Fiber reporting unit are recorded in \"Goodwill impairment charges\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nThe change in the carrying value of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nTowers\nFiber\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n5,127\n \n$\n4,958\n \n$\n10,085\n \nImpairment\n—\n \n(\n4,958\n)\n(\n4,958\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n5,127\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5,127\n \nIntangible Assets\nThe following is a summary of the Company's intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\nGross Carrying Value\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Book Value\nGross Carrying Value\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Book Value\nSite rental contracts and tenant relationships\n$\n7,879\n \n$\n(\n5,152\n)\n$\n2,727\n \n$\n7,880\n \n$\n(\n4,758\n)\n$\n3,122\n \nOther intangible assets\n113\n \n(\n59\n)\n54\n \n113\n \n(\n56\n)\n57\n \nTotal\n$\n7,992\n \n$\n(\n5,211\n)\n$\n2,781\n \n$\n7,993\n \n$\n(\n4,814\n)\n$\n3,179\n \n75\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets is classified as \"Depreciation, amortization and accretion\" on the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and was $\n397\n million, $\n447\n million, and $\n446\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe estimated annual amortization expense related to intangible assets for the years ending December 31, 2025 to 2029 is as follows:\n \nYears Ending December 31,\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nEstimated annual amortization\n$\n375\n \n$\n371\n \n$\n288\n \n$\n284\n \n$\n284\n \n6.\nOther Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities\nThe following is a summary of the components of \"Other long-term liabilities\" as presented on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.

In February 2016, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the February 2016 issuance of $\n1.5\n billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes offering to repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the then outstanding 364-Day Facility. \nIn February 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) incur additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $\n500\n million and (2) extend the maturity of both the 2016 Term Loan A and the 2016 Revolver to January 2022. \nIn August 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $\n3.5\n billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to August 2022.\nIn June 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $\n4.25\n billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2023. \nIn June 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Facility to (1) increase commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $\n5.0\n billion, and (2) extend the maturity of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2024.\nIn June 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date of the 2016 Credit Facility to June 2026, (2) reductions to the interest rate spread (\"Spread\") and unused commitment fee (\"Commitment Fee\") percentage upon meeting specified annual sustainability targets (\"Targets\") and increases to the Spread and Commitment Fee percentage upon the failure to meet specified annual sustainability thresholds (\"Thresholds\") and (3) the inclusion of \"hardwired\" LIBOR transition provisions consistent with those published by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee. The Spread and Commitment Fee are subject to an upward adjustment of up to \n0.05\n% and \n0.01\n%, respectively, if the Company fails to achieve the Thresholds. The Spread and Commitment Fee are subject to a downward adjustment of up to \n0.05\n% and \n0.01\n%, respectively, if the Company achieves the Targets. In January of the years 2022 through 2025, the Company submitted the required documentation and received confirmation from its administrative agent that all Targets were met as of the respective prior fiscal year ends, and, as such, the Spread and Commitment Fee percentage reductions were applied in January 2022 and maintained for 2023, 2024 and 2025.\nIn July 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2016 Credit Agreement that provided for, among other things, (1) the extension of the maturity date of the 2016 Credit Facility to July 2027, (2) an increase to the commitments on the 2016 Revolver to $\n7.0\n billion, (3) certain modifications to the specified sustainability metric and (4) the replacement of the LIBOR pricing benchmark with a Term SOFR pricing benchmark.\n78\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCommercial Paper Program. \nIn April 2019, the Company established a commercial paper program (\"CP Program\"), pursuant to which the Company may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (\"Commercial Paper Notes\"). Commercial Paper Notes may be issued, repaid and re-issued from time to time, with an aggregate principal amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding under the CP Program at any time originally not to exceed $\n1.0\n billion. The net proceeds of the Commercial Paper Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes, when outstanding, may vary but may not exceed \n397\n days from the date of issue. There were no Commercial Paper Notes issued or outstanding during the period that had original maturities greater than three months. The Commercial Paper Notes are issued under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, can be issued at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. At any point in time, the Company intends to maintain available commitments under its 2016 Revolver in an amount at least equal to the amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding. While any outstanding commercial paper issuances generally have short-term maturities, the Company classifies the outstanding issuances as long-term based on its ability and intent to refinance the outstanding issuances on a long-term basis.\nIn March 2022, the Company increased the size of the CP Program to permit the issuance of Commercial Paper Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $\n2.0\n billion at any time outstanding. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had net issuances of $\n1.3\n billion under the CP Program.\nSecuritized Debt\nThe Tower Revenue Notes and the Secured Notes, Series 2009-1, Class A-2 (\"2009 Securitized Notes\") (collectively, \"Securitized Debt\") are obligations of special purpose entities and their direct and indirect subsidiaries (each an \"issuer\"), all of which are wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries of CCI. The Tower Revenue Notes and 2009 Securitized Notes are governed by separate indentures. The 2015 Tower Revenue Notes and 2018 Tower Revenue Notes (each as defined below) are governed by one indenture and consist of multiple series of notes, each with its own anticipated repayment date.\nIn May 2015, the Company issued $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes (\"2015 Tower Revenue Notes\"), which were issued pursuant to the existing indenture and have similar terms and security as the Company's then outstanding Tower Revenue Notes. The 2015 Tower Revenue Notes originally consisted of (1) $\n300\n million aggregate principal amount of \n3.222\n% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of May 2022 and a final maturity date of May 2042 (\"Series 2015-1 Notes\") and (2) $\n700\n million aggregate principal amount of \n3.663\n% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of May 2025 and a final maturity date of May 2045 (\"Series 2015-2 Notes\"). The Company primarily used the net proceeds of the 2015 Tower Revenue Notes, together with proceeds received from the Company's sale of the formerly 77.6% owned subsidiary that operated towers in Australia (\"CCAL\"), to (1) repay $\n250\n million aggregate principal amount of previously outstanding August 2010 Tower Revenue Notes, (2) repay all of the then outstanding WCP Secured Wireless Site Contracts Revenue Notes, Series 2010-1 (\"WCP Securitized Notes\"), (3) repay portions of outstanding borrowings under the 2012 Credit Facility and (4) pay related fees and expenses. In June 2021, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the \n2.500\n% senior unsecured notes offering due July 2031 to repay in whole the Series 2015-1 Notes.\nIn July 2018, the Company issued $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes (\"2018 Tower Revenue Notes\"), which were issued pursuant to the existing indenture and have similar terms and security as the Company's then outstanding Tower Revenue Notes. The 2018 Tower Revenue Notes originally consisted of (1) $\n250\n million aggregate principal amount of \n3.720\n% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of July 2023 and a final maturity of July 2043 (\"Series 2018-1 Notes\") and (2) $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of \n4.241\n% senior secured tower revenue notes with an anticipated repayment date of July 2028 and a final maturity of July 2048 (\"Series 2018-2 Notes\"). The Company used the net proceeds of the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay all of the previously outstanding Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2010-6 and to pay related fees and expenses. In addition to the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes described above, in connection with Exchange Act risk retention requirements (\"Risk Retention Rules\"), an indirect subsidiary of the Company issued and a majority-owned affiliate of the Company purchased approximately $\n53\n million of the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2018-1, Class R-2028 to retain an eligible horizontal residual interest (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Tower Revenue Notes. In March 2022, the Company prepaid the Series 2018-1 Notes.\nThe Securitized Debt is paid solely from the cash flows generated by the operation of the towers held directly and indirectly by the issuers of the respective Securitized Debt. The Securitized Debt is secured by, among other things, (1) a security interest in substantially all of the applicable issuers' assignable personal property, (2) a pledge of the equity interests in each applicable issuer and (3) a security interest in the applicable issuers' leases with tenants to lease tower space (space \n79\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nlicenses). The governing instruments of two indirect subsidiaries (\"Crown Atlantic\" and \"Crown GT\") of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes generally prevent them from issuing debt and granting liens on their assets without the approval of a subsidiary of Verizon Communications. Consequently, while distributions paid by Crown Atlantic and Crown GT will service the Tower Revenue Notes, the Tower Revenue Notes are not obligations of, nor are the Tower Revenue Notes secured by the cash flows or any other assets of, Crown Atlantic and Crown GT. As of December 31, 2024, the Securitized Debt was collateralized with personal property and equipment with an aggregate net book value of approximately $\n667\n million, exclusive of Crown Atlantic and Crown GT personal property and equipment.\nThe excess cash flows from the issuers of the Securitized Debt, after the payment of principal, interest, reserves, expenses and management fees, are distributed to the Company in accordance with the terms of the indentures. If the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (\"DSCR\") (as defined in the applicable governing loan agreement) as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to a certain level, then all excess cash flow of the issuers of the applicable debt instrument will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Company. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Company until the DSCR exceeds a certain level for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the DSCR falls below a certain level as of the end of any calendar quarter, then all cash on deposit in the reserve account along with future excess cash flows of the issuers will be applied to prepay the debt with applicable prepayment consideration.\nThe Company may repay the Securitized Debt in whole or in part at any time, provided in each case that such prepayment is accompanied by any applicable prepayment consideration. The Securitized Debt has covenants and restrictions customary for rated securitizations, including provisions prohibiting the issuers from incurring additional indebtedness or further encumbering their assets. The Company is currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants.\nBonds—Senior Notes\nIn August 2024, the Company issued $\n550\n million aggregate principal amount of \n4.900\n% senior unsecured notes due 2029 and $\n700\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.200\n% senior unsecured notes due 2034 (collectively, \"August 2024 Senior Notes\"). The Company used the net proceeds from the August 2024 Senior Notes offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the CP Program and pay related fees and expenses.\nIn December 2023, the Company issued $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.600\n% senior unsecured notes due June 2029 and $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.800\n% senior unsecured notes due March 2034 (collectively, \"December 2023 Senior Notes\"). The Company used the net proceeds from the December 2023 Senior Notes offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under its commercial paper program and pay related fees and expenses.\nIn April 2023, the Company issued $\n600\n million aggregate principal amount of \n4.800\n% senior unsecured notes due September 2028 and $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.100\n% senior unsecured notes due May 2033 (collectively, \"April 2023 Senior Notes\"). The Company used the net proceeds from the April 2023 Senior Notes offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2016 Revolver and pay related fees and expenses.\nIn January 2023, the Company issued $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.000\n% senior unsecured notes due January 2028 (\"January 2023 Senior Notes\"). The Company used the net proceeds from the January 2023 Senior Notes offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2016 Revolver and pay related fees and expenses.\nIn March 2022, the Company issued $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of \n2.900\n% senior unsecured notes due March 2027 (\"March 2022 Senior Notes\"). The Company used the net proceeds from the March 2022 Senior Notes offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the CP Program and pay related fees and expenses.\nEach of the outstanding senior notes listed in the table above (collectively, \"Senior Notes\") are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, including obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility, and senior to all of the Company's future subordinated indebtedness. The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company's subsidiaries are not guarantors of the Senior Notes.\nThe Company may redeem any of the Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus a make whole premium, if applicable, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.\n80\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nPreviously Outstanding Indebtedness\nBonds—Senior Notes. \nIn September 2024, the Company repaid in full the previously outstanding \n3.200\n% senior unsecured notes due September 2024.\nScheduled Principal Payments and Final Maturities\nThe following are the scheduled principal payments and final maturities of the total debt and other long-term obligations of the Company outstanding as of December 31, 2024, which do not consider the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the Tower Revenue Notes. If the Tower Revenue Notes are not paid in full on or prior to their respective anticipated repayment dates, as applicable, then the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the indenture) of the issuers of such notes will be used to repay principal of the applicable series and class of the Tower Revenue Notes and additional interest (of an additional approximately \n5\n% per annum) will accrue on the Tower Revenue Notes.\nYears Ending December 31,\nThereafter\nTotal Cash Obligations\nUnamortized Adjustments, Net\nTotal Debt and Other Obligations Outstanding\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nScheduled principal payments and\nfinal maturities\n$\n1,951\n \n(a)\n$\n2,787\n \n$\n3,258\n \n$\n2,635\n \n$\n2,478\n \n$\n11,130\n \n$\n24,239\n \n$\n(\n158\n)\n$\n24,081\n \n \n(a)\nPredominately consists of outstanding indebtedness under the CP Program and the \n1.350\n% senior unsecured notes due July 2025.\nPurchases and Redemptions of Long-Term Debt\nThe following is a summary of the purchases, payments and redemptions of long-term debt during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \nPrincipal Amount\nCash Paid\n(a)\nGains (losses)\n(b)\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n3.200% Senior Unsecured Notes\n750\n \n750\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n750\n \n$\n750\n \n$\n—\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n3.150% Senior Unsecured Notes\n750\n \n750\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n750\n \n$\n750\n \n$\n—\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nTower Revenue Notes, Series 2018-1\n$\n250\n \n$\n252\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\n3.849% Secured Notes\n1,000\n \n1,022\n \n(\n23\n)\n2016 Revolver\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\nTotal\n$\n1,250\n \n$\n1,274\n \n$\n(\n28\n)\n \n(a)\nExclusive of accrued interest.\n(b)\nInclusive of the write-off of the respective deferred financing costs\n.\n8.\nFair Value Disclosures\nThe following table shows the estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments, along with the carrying amounts of the related assets (liabilities).

These amounts include approximately $\n237\n million of losses related to stock-based compensation. As footnoted above, the Company’s federal and state NOLs are valued at a tax rate of 0% for deferred income tax purposes due to the Company’s REIT status.\n \nAs a result, any expirations of these NOLs will not have any impact on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet or the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The Company also has foreign NOLs of $\n3\n million. If not utilized, the Company's U.S. federal NOLs expire starting in 2025 and ending in 2036, the remaining state NOLs expire starting in 2025 and ending in 2043, and the foreign NOLs start expiring in 2028 and ending in 2036. The federal NOLs potentially expiring in 2025 are $\n128\n million, and the state NOLs potentially expiring in 2025 are $\n52\n million. The utilization of the NOLs is subject to certain limitations. The Company's U.S. federal and state income tax returns generally remain open to examination by taxing authorities until three years after the applicable NOLs have been used or expired.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were no unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. \nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to examinations by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. At this time, the Company is not subject to an Internal Revenue Service examination.\nThe Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it has business operations. The Company has no uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, the Company does \n83\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nnot believe any such additional assessments arising from examinations or audits will have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's deferred tax assets are included in \"Other assets, net\" and the Company's deferred tax liabilities are included in \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\n \n10.\nEquity\n2021 \"At-the-Market\" Stock Offering Program \nThe Company previously maintained an \"at-the-market\" stock offering program through which it had the right to issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $\n750\n million (\"2021 ATM Program\"). The Company terminated its previously outstanding 2021 ATM Program in March 2024 with the entire gross sales price of $\n750\n million remaining unsold.\n2024 \"At-the-Market\" Stock Offering Program\nIn March 2024, the Company established a new \"at-the-market\" stock offering program through which it may issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $\n750\n million (\"2024 ATM Program\"). Sales under the 2024 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to the Company's specific instructions, at negotiated prices. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from any sales under the 2024 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include (1) the funding of future acquisitions or investments or (2) the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness.

Certain RSU agreements contain provisions that result in forfeiture by the employee of any unvested shares in the event that the Company's common stock does not achieve certain market performance targets. To the extent that the requisite service is rendered, compensation cost for accounting purposes is not reversed; rather, it is recognized regardless of whether or not the market performance target is achieved. \n85\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation to determine the grant-date fair value for the RSUs with market conditions granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRisk-free rate\n4.4\n \n%\n4.5\n \n%\n1.7\n \n%\nExpected volatility\n27\n \n%\n27\n \n%\n31\n \n%\nExpected dividend rate\n5.5\n \n%\n4.6\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\nThe Company recognized aggregate stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs of $\n111\n million, $\n139\n million and $\n134\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

While there are uncertainties inherent in the ultimate outcome of such matters and it is impossible to presently determine the ultimate costs or losses that may be incurred, if any, management believes the adverse resolution of such uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs should not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also contingently liable for commitments or performance guarantees arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain letters of credit or surety bonds. \nSee note 13 for a discussion of operating lease commitments. In addition, as mentioned in note 4, the Company has the option to purchase approximately \n54\n% of its towers at the end of their respective lease terms.

The Towers segment provides access, including space or capacity, to the Company's more than \n40,000\n towers geographically dispersed throughout the U.S. The Towers segment also reflects certain ancillary services relating to the Company's towers, predominately consisting of site development services and installation services. See note 16 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's 2023 Restructuring Plan, which included discontinuing installation services as a Towers product offering and note 17 for a discussion of the sale of the Fiber segment which is expected to close in the first half of 2026. The Fiber segment provides access, including space or capacity, to the Company's approximately (1) \n87\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n105,000\n small cells either currently generating revenue or under contract and (2) \n90,000\n route miles of fiber primarily supporting small cells and fiber solutions geographically dispersed throughout the U.S. \nThe Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer functions as the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\").  \nThe measurement of profit or loss primarily used by the CODM to evaluate the performance of the Company's operating segments is segment operating profit (loss). The CODM uses segment operating profit (loss) to evaluate budget-to-actual variances to assist in deciding whether to (1) reinvest capital into the Company's operating segments by constructing new assets, acquire new assets or land interests (which primarily relate to land assets under towers), or make improvements and structural enhancements to our existing infrastructure, (2) return cash generated to stockholders in the form of dividends, (3) purchase shares of our common stock, or (4) repurchase, repay, or redeem the Company's debt.  The CODM also uses segment operating profit (loss) in the evaluation of pricing of new projects and new tenant agreements.  Additionally, the Company CODM reviews segment adjusted site rental gross margin and segment adjusted services and other gross margin. The CODM uses segment adjusted site rental gross margin and segment adjusted services and other gross margin to (1) evaluate the economic productivity of the Company's operating segments, (2) identify underlying business trends that are impacting the Company's segment performance, (3) assist in making resource allocation decisions and (4) aid in the preparation of the annual operating budget for the Company's operating segments.\nThe Company defines segment operating profit (loss) as segment site rental revenues plus segment services and other revenues, less segment site rental costs of operations, segment services and other costs of operations, and segment selling, general and administrative expenses, each of which excludes stock-based compensation, net, and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, which are recorded in the respective consolidated figures.  The Company defines segment adjusted site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense, net and amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental costs of operations. The Company defines segment adjusted services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense, net recorded in consolidated services and other costs of operations. All of these measurements are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. \nCosts that are directly attributable to Towers and Fiber are assigned to those respective segments. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in the Company's segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable. The \"Other Non-Segment Items\" column, which does not meet the criteria to be classified as a reportable segment, (1) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, goodwill impairment, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, net, gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest income, other income (expense), stock-based compensation expense, net and certain selling, general and administrative expenses, and (2) reconciles segment operating profit (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes, as the amounts are not utilized in assessing each segment’s performance. The \"Other Non-Segment Items\" total assets balance includes corporate assets such as cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents which have not been allocated to specific segments. For both the Towers and Fiber segments, other segment costs of operations primarily consists of (1) utilities, (2) property taxes, (3) third-party costs related to ancillary services performed and (4) various other insignificant expenses. Other segment selling, general and administrative expenses primarily contains an allocation of corporate facilities expense relating to employees operating for each respective segment and external selling costs in the Fiber segment.  There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company's operating segments.\n88\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2024 Segment Results and Significant Segment Expenses\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nTowers\nFiber\nOther Non-Segment Items\nTotal\nSegment site rental revenues\n$\n4,266\n \n$\n2,092\n \n$\n6,358\n \nSegment services and other revenues\n192\n \n18\n \n210\n \nSegment revenues\n4,458\n \n2,110\n \n6,568\n \nSegment site rental costs of operations\n959\n \n734\n \n1,693\n \nSegment services and other costs of operations\n101\n \n12\n \n113\n \nSegment costs of operations\n(a)(b)\n1,060\n \n746\n \n1,806\n \nSegment adjusted site rental gross margin\n3,307\n \n1,358\n \n4,665\n \nSegment adjusted services and other gross margin\n91\n \n6\n \n97\n \nSegment selling, general and administrative expenses\n(b)\n76\n \n176\n \n252\n \nSegment operating profit (loss)\n3,322\n \n1,188\n \n4,510\n \nOther selling, general and administrative expenses\n(b)\n$\n348\n \n348\n \nStock-based compensation expense, net\n131\n \n131\n \nDepreciation, amortization and accretion\n1,738\n \n1,738\n \nRestructuring charges\n109\n \n109\n \nInterest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, net\n932\n \n932\n \nGoodwill impairment\n4,958\n \n4,958\n \nOther (income) expenses to reconcile to income (loss) before income taxes\n(c)\n173\n \n173\n \nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n$\n(\n3,879\n)\nCapital expenditures\n$\n133\n \n$\n1,045\n \n$\n44\n \n$\n1,222\n \nTotal assets (at year end)\n$\n20,814\n \n$\n11,283\n \n$\n639\n \n$\n32,736\n \nTotal goodwill (at year end)\n$\n5,127\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5,127\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nTowers\nFiber\nOther Non-Segment Items\nTotal\nSegment costs of operations:\nLease expense\n$\n745\n \n$\n369\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,114\n \nEmployee compensation expense\n90\n \n95\n \n—\n \n185\n \nRepairs and maintenance expense\n54\n \n120\n \n—\n \n174\n \nOther segment costs of operations expense\n171\n \n162\n \n—\n \n333\n \nTotal segment costs of operations\n(a)(b)\n1,060\n \n746\n \n—\n \n1,806\n \nSegment selling, general and administrative expenses:\nEmployee compensation expense\n63\n \n102\n \n160\n \n325\n \nOther segment selling, general and administrative expenses\n13\n \n74\n \n188\n \n275\n \nTotal segment selling, general and administrative expenses\n(b)\n$\n76\n \n$\n176\n \n$\n348\n \n$\n600\n \n \n(a)\nExclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion shown separately.\n(b)\nSegment costs of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 excludes (1) stock-based compensation expense, net of $\n25\n million and (2) prepaid lease purchase price adjustments of $\n16\n million.

The Company's restricted cash and cash equivalents are predominately held and directed by a trustee (see note 2). \nThe Company derives the largest portion of its revenues from tenants in the wireless industry. The Company also has a concentration in its volume of business with T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon Wireless or their agents that accounts for a significant portion of the Company's revenues, receivables and deferred site rental receivables. The Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its tenants, the use of tenant leases with contractually determinable payment terms or proactive management of past due balances.\n15.\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nThe following table is a summary of the supplemental cash flow information during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information:\nCash payments related to operating lease liabilities\n(a)\n$\n566\n \n$\n571\n \n$\n560\n \nInterest paid\n895\n \n800\n \n684\n \nIncome taxes paid \n17\n \n18\n \n10\n \nSupplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities:\nROU assets recorded in exchange for operating lease liabilities\n4\n \n12\n \n191\n \nIncrease (decrease) in accounts payable for purchases of property and equipment\n(\n33\n)\n36\n \n(\n5\n)\nCapitalized stock-based compensation\n23\n \n29\n \n21\n \nPurchase of property and equipment under finance leases and installment land purchases\n69\n \n62\n \n28\n \n \n(a)\nExcludes the Company's contingent payments pursuant to operating leases, which are recorded as expense in the period such contingencies are resolved.\nThe reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported within various lines on the consolidated balance sheet to amounts reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows is shown below.\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n119\n \n$\n105\n \n$\n156\n \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents, current\n171\n \n171\n \n166\n \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents reported within other assets, net\n5\n \n5\n \n5\n \nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents\n$\n295\n \n$\n281\n \n$\n327\n \n \n92\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n16.\nRestructuring\n2023 Restructuring Plan\nIn July 2023, the Company initiated the 2023 Restructuring Plan as part of its efforts to reduce costs to better align the Company's operational needs with lower tower activity. The 2023 Restructuring Plan included reducing the Company's total employee headcount by approximately \n15\n%, discontinuing installation services as a Towers product offering while continuing to offer site development services on Company towers, and consolidating office space. \nThe 2023 Restructuring Plan included charges related to the (1) employee headcount reduction, including severance, stock-based compensation and other one-time termination benefits and (2) office space consolidation, which included remaining obligations under facility leases and non-cash charges for accelerated depreciation. The actions associated with the 2023 Restructuring Plan were substantially completed and related charges were recorded by June 30, 2024. The payments for the employee headcount reduction were completed in 2024, while payments for the office space consolidation are expected to be completed in 2032. \nThe following tables summarize the activities related to the 2023 Restructuring Plan for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nEmployee Headcount Reduction\nOffice Space Consolidation\nTotal\nEmployee Headcount Reduction\nOffice Space Consolidation\nTotal\nLiability as of the beginning of the respective year\n$\n16\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nCharges (credits)\n—\n \n9\n \n9\n \n63\n \n22\n \n85\n \nPayments\n(\n14\n)\n(\n12\n)\n(\n26\n)\n(\n46\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n50\n)\nNon-cash items\n—\n \n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n7\n)\nLiability as of the end of the respective year\n$\n2\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n28\n \n2024 Restructuring Plan\nIn June 2024, the Company initiated the 2024 Restructuring Plan as part of its efforts to drive operational efficiencies and reduce operating costs and capital expenditures, with a primary focus on the Company's Fiber segment. As a result, the Company announced a reduction of the Company's total employee headcount by more than \n10\n% and the closing of certain offices.\nThe 2024 Restructuring Plan includes charges related to the (1) employee headcount reduction, including severance, stock-based compensation and other one-time termination benefits and (2) office closures, which includes remaining obligations under facility leases and non-cash charges for accelerated depreciation. The actions associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan were substantially completed and the related charges were recorded by December 31, 2024, while the payments are expected to be completed for the employee headcount reduction in 2025 and office closures in 2033.  The Company may incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the 2024 Restructuring Plan.\nThe following table summarizes the activities related to the 2024 Restructuring Plan for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nEmployee Headcount Reduction\nOffice Space Consolidation\nTotal\nLiability as of December 31, 2023\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nCharges (credits)\n39\n \n61\n \n100\n \nPayments\n(\n34\n)\n(\n10\n)\n$\n(\n44\n)\nNon-cash items\n4\n \n(\n12\n)\n$\n(\n8\n)\nLiability as of December 31, 2024\n$\n9\n \n$\n39\n \n$\n48\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the liability for restructuring charges is included in \"Other accrued liabilities\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the consolidated balance sheet, and the corresponding expense is included in \"Restructuring charges\" on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\n93\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe Company does not allocate restructuring charges between its operating segments. If charges related to the Restructuring Plans were allocated to operating segments, for the year ended December 31, 2024, $\n13\n million and $\n64\n million of the aforementioned charge would have been allocated to the Company's Towers and Fiber segments, respectively, with the remaining $\n32\n million allocated to Other.  Similarly, for the year ended December 31, 2023, $\n44\n million and $\n18\n million of the aforementioned charge would have been allocated to the Company's Towers and Fiber segment, respectively, with the remaining $\n23\n million allocated to Other.\n17.\nSubsequent Events\nCommon Stock Dividend\nOn February 26, 2025, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n1.565\n per common share. The quarterly dividend will be payable on March 31, 2025, to common stockholders of record as of March 14, 2025.\nStrategic Fiber Transaction\nOn March 13, 2025, the Company signed the Strategic Fiber Agreement to sell its Fiber Business, with Zayo acquiring the fiber solutions business and EQT acquiring the small cell business. Under the Strategic Fiber Agreement, the Company will receive $\n8.5\n billion in aggregate, subject to certain closing adjustments.  The Fiber Business did not meet the criteria for assets held for sale as of December 31, 2024, and therefore remains presented as a component of continuing operations. In subsequent periods, the Fiber Business will be presented as a discontinued operation, and its net assets will be classified as held for sale and comparable prior periods will be recast to reflect this change. Upon classification as held for sale in the first quarter of 2025, the Company expects to recognize a loss of between $\n700\n million and $\n800\n million, inclusive of estimated transaction fees. This Strategic Fiber transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026, subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\n94\nItem 9.    \nChanges in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A.    \nControls and Procedures\n(a) Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIn connection with the preparation of the 2024 Form 10-K, the Company's management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"Exchange Act\")). Based upon their evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's CEO and CFO, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework \n(2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Based on the Company's assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Part II, Item 8 of the 2024 Form 10-K.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n(d) Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nBecause of its inherent limitations, the Company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\n95\nItem 9B.    \nOther Information\nNone.\nItem 9C.    \nDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nN/A\n96\nPART III\nItem 10.    \nDirectors and Executive Officers of the Registrant\nThe information required to be furnished pursuant to this item will be set forth under \"Executive Compensation\n—\nExecutive Officers,\" \"Election of Directors\n—\nNominees for Director,\" \"Other Matters\n—\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports,\" if applicable, \"Election of Directors\n—\nBoard Committees\" and \"Other Matters\n—\nAvailable Information\" in the 2025 Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe have adopted an \nInsider Trading Policy\n and procedures governing the purchase, sale or other disposition of our securities by directors, officers, employees, contingent workers, contractors and consultants, which we believe are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations and applicable NYSE listing standards.
