    "item1": "Item 16.\nForm 10-K Summary\n122\nSignatures\nPART I\nItem 1.\n \n Business\nUnless this Form 10-K indicates otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Sysco,” or the “company” as used in this Form 10-K refer to Sysco Corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries and divisions.\nOverview\nSysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions, is the largest global distributor of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry. Our purpose is “Connecting the World to Share Food and Care for One Another.” We provided products and related services to approximately 730,000 customer locations, including restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers during fiscal 2025. \nFounded in 1969, Sysco commenced operations as a public company in March 1970 when the stockholders of nine companies exchanged their stock for Sysco common stock. Since our formation, we have grown from $115 million to our all-time high of $81.4 billion in annual sales in fiscal 2025, both through internal expansion of existing operations and acquisitions. \nSysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ended June 28, 2025 for fiscal 2025, a 52-week year ended June 29, 2024 for fiscal 2024 and a 52-week year ended July 1, 2023 for fiscal 2023. We will have a 52-week year ending June 27, 2026 for fiscal 2026. \nAvailable Information\nSysco Corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware. The address and telephone number of our executive offices are 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077-2099, (281) 584-1390. This annual report on Form 10-K, as well as all other annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed or furnished by Sysco pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available free of charge on Sysco’s website at \nwww.sysco.com\n as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished with the SEC. Sysco also periodically provides certain information for investors on its website at \nwww.sysco.com\n. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to Sysco’s annual meeting of stockholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this filing.\nReporting Segments\nSysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. Our primary operations are in North America and Europe. Under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise, we have combined certain operations into three reportable segments. “Other” financial information is attributable to our other operations that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds.\n•\nU.S. Foodservice Operations\n – primarily includes (a) our U.S. Broadline operations, which distribute a full line of food products, including custom-cut meat, seafood, produce, specialty Italian, specialty imports and a wide variety of non-food products and (b) our U.S. Specialty operations, which include our FreshPoint fresh produce distribution business, our Buckhead | Newport Meat & Seafood specialty protein operations, our growing Italian Specialty platform anchored by Greco & Sons, Inc., our Edward Don restaurant equipment and supplies distribution business, our Asian specialty distribution company and a number of other small specialty businesses that are not material to the operations of Sysco; \n•\nInternational Foodservice Operations\n – includes operations outside of the United States (U.S.), which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products. The Americas primarily consists of operations in Canada, Bahamas, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as our export operations that distribute to international customers. Our European operations primarily consist of operations in the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Ireland and Sweden;\n•\nSYGMA\n – our U.S. customized distribution operations serving quick-service chain restaurant customer locations; and\n•\nOther\n – primarily our hotel supply operations, Guest Worldwide.\n1\nFoodservice operating sites distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both independent and chain restaurant customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served. SYGMA operating sites distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations. Selected financial data for each of our reportable segments, as well as financial information concerning geographic areas, can be found in Note 21, “Business Segment Information,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nCustomers and Products\nSysco’s customers in the foodservice industry include restaurants, hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, schools and colleges, hotels and motels, industrial caterers and other similar venues where foodservice products are served.\nThe products we distribute include:\n•\nfrozen foods, such as meats, seafood, fully prepared entrées, fruits, vegetables and desserts;\n•\ncanned and dry foods;\n•\nfresh meats and seafood;\n•\ndairy products;\n•\nbeverage products;\n•\nimported specialties; and\n•\nfresh produce.\nWe also supply a wide variety of non-food items, including:\n•\npaper products such as disposable napkins, plates and cups;\n•\ntableware such as glassware and silverware;\n•\ncookware such as pots, pans and utensils;\n•\nrestaurant and kitchen equipment and supplies; and\n•\ncleaning supplies.\nA comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below:\nPrincipal product categories\n2025\n2024\n2023\nFresh and frozen meats\n19 \n%\n18 \n%\n18 \n%\nCanned and dry products\n18 \n19 \n19 \nFrozen fruits, vegetables, bakery and other\n15 \n15 \n15 \nDairy products\n11 \n10 \n11 \nPoultry\n10 \n10 \n10 \nFresh produce\n8 \n9 \n9 \nPaper and disposables\n7 \n7 \n7 \nBeverage products\n4 \n4 \n3 \nSeafood\n3 \n4 \n4 \nEquipment and smallwares \n2 \n2 \n1 \nOther\n (1)\n3 \n2 \n3 \nTotals\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n(1)\nOther sales relate to certain non-food products, including textiles and amenities for our hotel supply business, other janitorial products, and medical supplies.\nOur distribution centers, which we refer to as operating sites, distribute branded merchandise, as well as products packaged under our private brands. Products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for Sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team. In addition, our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged, enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements.\nWe believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders, competitive pricing, customer service and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the \n2\nmarketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers. Our operating sites offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice. Through the sales and marketing representatives and support staff, we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services. We also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution, such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data, menu-planning advice, food safety training and assistance in inventory control. Additionally, we provide access to various third-party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses.\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of Sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2025.\nWe estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows:\nType of Customer\n2025\n2024\n2023\nRestaurants \n60 \n%\n62 \n%\n62 \n%\nEducation, government\n8 \n7 \n8 \nHealthcare\n8 \n7 \n7 \nTravel and leisure\n7 \n6 \n8 \nOther \n(1)\n17 \n18 \n15 \nTotals\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n(1)\nOther includes cafeterias that are not stand-alone restaurants, bakeries, caterers, churches, civic and fraternal organizations, vending distributors, other distributors and international exports, as well as retail food sales and logistics services. None of these types of customers, as a group, exceeded 5% of total sales in any of the years for which information is presented.\nWe estimate that sales to our customers in the food service management (FSM) sector, which include large customers that service cafeterias in institutions such as universities, hospitals, and sporting venues, accounted for 8% of sales in both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. These sales are reflected within the respective customer types listed in the table above, depending on the type of customer the FSM operator serves.\nSources of Supply\nWe purchase from thousands of suppliers, both domestic and international, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of our purchases for fiscal 2025. These suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise, as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers. We also provide specialty and seasonal products from small to mid-sized producers to meet a growing demand for locally sourced products. Our locally sourced products, including produce, meats, cheese and other products, help differentiate our customers’ offerings, satisfy demand for new products, and support local communities. Merchandise is generally purchased through both centrally developed programs, domestically and internationally, and direct programs established by our various operating sites. For our U.S. Foodservice Operations, which represents approximately 70% of our total sales, over 90% of products are purchased domestically. \nWe administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop, obtain and ensure consistent quality food and non-food products. The program covers the purchasing and marketing of branded merchandise, as well as products from several national brand suppliers, encompassing substantially all product lines. Some of our products are purchased internationally within global procurement centers to build strategic relationships with international suppliers and to optimize our supply chain network. We also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and aggregate inventory levels. This reduces future facility expansion needs at our operating sites, while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers.\nWorking Capital Practices\nOur growth is funded through a combination of cash on hand, cash flow from operations, commercial paper issuances and long-term borrowings. See the discussion in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” regarding our liquidity, financial position and sources and uses of funds. \nWe extend credit terms to some of our customers based on our assessment of each customer’s creditworthiness. We monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary.\nA majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of customer order placement. We generally maintain inventory on hand to meet customer demand. The level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelf-life, supplier order \n3\nfulfillment lead times and customer demand. We also purchase additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities. We take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate. Otherwise, we pay our suppliers according to our payment terms.\nGlobal Support Center\nOur Global Support Center (GSC) provides numerous centralized services to our operating sites and performs support activities for employees, suppliers and customers. GSC team members possess experience and expertise in, among other areas, customer and vendor contract administration, finance, legal, information technology, risk management and insurance, sales and marketing, merchandising, inbound logistics, human resources, and strategy.\nCapital Improvements\nDuring fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, $906 million, $832 million and $793 million, respectively, were invested in facilities, technology, equipment, delivery fleet and other capital asset enhancements. From time to time, we dispose of assets in the normal course of business, and we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures. During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, were $692 million, $753 million and $751 million, respectively. Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.0%, respectively. During the three years ended June 28, 2025, capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds along with bank and other borrowings. We expect our capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, to approximate $700 million in fiscal 2026, and we expect to finance these capital expenditures from cash flows from operations and bank and other borrowings.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe believe engaged and empowered colleagues are key to business success. Attracting, developing and retaining the best talent globally drives the company’s long-term value. Our diverse colleagues and inclusive culture create an environment where colleagues can develop their skills and contribute to our success. As of June 28, 2025, we employed approximately 75,000 employees, including 51,000 U.S. employees and 24,000 employees outside the U.S., as compared to approximately 76,000 employees as of June 29, 2024. Also, approximately 99% of our U.S.-based colleagues are classified as full-time, defined as employees who work 30 or more hours per week. Approximately 14% of our employees were represented by unions, primarily the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and unions in France and Sweden. Approximately 14% of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to renegotiation in fiscal 2026.\nTalent Acquisition and Talent Management \n— Maintaining a pipeline of talent is critical to our ongoing success and is essential to our succession planning efforts and to growing leaders throughout the organization. Our leadership is responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development. Specifically, we promote employee development by cultivating a high-impact learning culture for our colleagues through a variety of enterprise development programs and learning resources, including goal setting and career development processes. We commit to investing in our employees through on-the-job training and coaching. Additionally, through our Sysco Speaks program, we conduct annual, confidential engagement surveys of our global workforce that are administered and analyzed by an independent third party.\nTotal Rewards \n— We are committed to equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider various factors, such as an employee’s role and experience, job location and individual performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices to promote fair and equitable pay. In fiscal 2025, our hourly colleagues received an average hourly wage of approximately $25, and 100% of colleagues in our U.S. distribution facilities received pay above state minimum wage thresholds. Also, some of our full-time colleagues receive paid vacation and sick time benefits, short-term and long-term incentives, retirement plans, training and development, access to career opportunities, paid pregnancy and adoption leave benefits, short-term and long-term disability benefits, health and welfare benefits, and recognition, as well as other programs like employee discounts.\nInclusion \n— Our Inclusion team develops and operationalizes global strategic initiatives that are designed to ensure that every colleague, customer, supplier and/or partner – regardless of identity, background, or life experience – feels valued, respected, and empowered to contribute. To further this goal, our Chief Inclusion Officer works collaboratively with our Global Inclusion Council to ensure a strategy that meets the needs of our full colleague population, as well as the vibrant, diverse customers and communities we serve. Our global strategy is further advanced by our 11 Colleague Resource Groups (CRGs) – voluntary, colleague-led groups that enhance inclusion and belonging through programming and initiatives falling into the following areas: \n4\ncolleague, community, culture, and corporation. Each CRG is helmed by a VP+ level Executive Sponsor to ensure alignment with business priorities, and each group is open to all colleagues.\nAs of June 28, 2025, our U.S. employee population possessed the gender, ethnic and racial attributes identified below:\nUnited States Employee Population \n(1)\nMale\nFemale\nWhite\nHispanic or Latino\nBlack or African American\nAsian\nAmerican Indian or Alaskan Native\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\nTwo or more races\nNot Available\nIndividual Contributors\n80 \n%\n20 \n%\n40 \n%\n27 \n%\n22 \n%\n5 \n%\n1 \n%\n1 \n%\n2 \n%\n2 \n%\nManagement\n71 \n29 \n62 \n16 \n11 \n5 \n1 \n1 \n2 \n2 \nSenior Management\n73 \n27 \n76 \n8 \n6 \n5 \n— \n— \n1 \n4 \nOfficers\n76 \n24 \n63 \n7 \n9 \n3 \n2 \n— \n2 \n14 \nTotal Sysco\n79 \n21 \n43 \n26 \n21 \n5 \n1 \n1 \n2 \n1 \n(1)\nInformation is based on self-reported identification.\nInformation about our Executive Officers:\nThe section below provides information regarding our executive officers as of August 21, 2025. There are no family relationships between any of the officers named and any other executive officer or member of the Board of Directors, or any arrangement or understanding pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer.

Our customers may choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets, including club, cash and carry and grocery stores, online retailers, or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers. We compete with local and regional distributors and some organizations that operate on a multi-region basis. In addition, these local, regional and multi-regional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix, improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities. Our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently. Customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors; specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce, meat or seafood; other wholesale channels; club stores; cash and carry stores; grocery stores; and numerous online retailers. Since switching costs are very low, customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts, the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis, and competitive prices. There are few barriers to market entry. \nWe estimate that we serve about 17% of an approximately $370 billion annual foodservice market in the U.S., as estimated by Technomic, Inc., for calendar year 2024. Technomic projects the market size to increase to approximately $382 billion by the end of calendar 2025. We also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share. We believe, based upon industry trade data, our sales to the U.S. and Canada food-away-from-home industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2025. While comprehensive industry statistics are not available, we believe that, in most instances, our operations in the U.S. and Canada are among the leading distributors of food and related non-food products to foodservice customers in those trade areas. We believe our competitive advantages include our sales consultants; our diversified product base, which includes quality-assured Sysco brand products; our service reliability; the ancillary services we provide to our customers, such as business reviews and menu analysis; and our multi-regional presence in North America and Europe. These advantages combined with a large geographical footprint of multi-temperature warehouses, mitigate some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business.\nIn the U.S., as a marketer and distributor of food products, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates, including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through \n6\ngood manufacturing practice regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) requirements for certain foods, and the food and color additive approval process. The agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods; prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels; regulates food contact packaging and materials; and maintains a Reportable Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990\n, \nthe Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. The USDA reviews and approves the labeling of meat and poultry products, regulates the production, handling, labeling, and enforcement of all USDA organic products, and establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers. We are also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human or animal consumption.\nThe Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) has significantly expanded our food safety requirements, including certain mandatory safety prevention practices. The FDA has finalized numerous regulations implementing FSMA, recognizing that ensuring the safety of the food supply is a shared responsibility among many different points in the global supply chain. The FSMA rules are designed to identify specific actions that must be taken at each of these points to prevent contamination. We have established and continue to maintain comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated, as required by FDA regulations implementing FSMA. FSMA further imposes requirements for food products imported into the U.S. All food intended for introduction into U.S. interstate commerce must be safe, sanitary, and labeled according to U.S. requirements.  Importers can import food into the U.S. as long as the facilities that produce, store, or otherwise handle the products are registered with the FDA, and prior notice of incoming shipments is provided to the FDA. Imported food products are subject to FDA inspection at U.S. ports of entry and the FDA may detain shipments of products if the shipments are found to be non-compliant with U.S. requirements. FSMA also provides the FDA with expanded enforcement authority, including mandatory recall authority over all articles of food (other than infant formula) that are manufactured, processed, packed, or held at a food facility that is required to register with the FDA.  \nAs a marketer and distributor of various non-food products, such as food containers and utensils, kitchen equipment, and cleaning supplies, we are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to the safety, storage, transportation, sale, advertising and labeling of those non-food products, including requirements to provide information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute and regulations restricting the sale of products made with certain materials or chemicals. \nWe and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute. We are also subject to the National Labor Relations Act, which governs the process for collective bargaining between employers and employees and protects the rights of both employers and employees in the workplace. The Fair Labor Standards Act establishes minimum wages and overtime standards, among other requirements, and prohibits discrimination in employment based on non-merit categories, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other laws relating to accessibility. Our workers’ compensation programs are subject to regulation by the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections by the FDA and USDA. Our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal and/or state authorities. We also must comply with Federal Trade Commission standards with respect to any claims made about our food products in advertising and marketing materials.\nOur customers include several departments of the federal government, including the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, as well as certain state and local entities. These customer relationships subject us to additional regulations applicable to government contractors.\nWe are also subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers. We are also subject to regulations by the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well as its agencies, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \n7\nwhich collectively regulate our trucking operations through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations. We are subject to regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration covering items transported by air. In addition, we are subject to the federal False Claims Act, and similar state statutes, which prohibit knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government and the knowing and improper retention of overpayments. \nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized and recorded. We have implemented and continue to develop an anti-corruption compliance program applicable to our global operations intended to detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anti-corruption laws in countries where we operate.\nOur business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the U.S. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. In many jurisdictions, compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us. Our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.\nOutside the U.S., our business is subject to numerous similar statutes, regulations, and other regulatory requirements. For example, we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements of the U.K. and the European Union (EU), as well as those of EU countries, where we conduct business (including Ireland, France and Sweden). Those requirements relate to, among other things, competition, product composition, packaging, labeling, advertisement (including nutrition and health claims) and the safety of food products, as well as the health, safety and working conditions of employees. We are subject to privacy laws in the EU, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data. In addition, our business is subject to the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015, which requires certain companies that operate in the U.K. to prepare a report describing steps that they have taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in their supply chain or business. Our business is also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, an anti-corruption law that criminalizes the failure by a company to prevent persons associated with that company from offering or paying bribes to government officials or non-government persons in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company, as well as restricting the offer, payment or receipt of bribes to or from governmental officials and non-governmental persons.\nAll of our company’s facilities and other operations in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU, relating to: (1) the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater; (2) the discharge of pollutants into the air, including vehicle emissions; (3) proper handling, treatment and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes; and (4) protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases. Further, most of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks (including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks).

Greater use of technology and digitization in operations has delivered benefits to our business, while also exposing us and others in our industry to new vulnerabilities in corporate and operational systems. Additionally, our business operations leverage third-party vendors and systems, which makes us susceptible to various cyber threats.\nThe scale, scope, and complexity of our business raises a multitude of interdependent risks, which can vary over time. A primary responsibility of our leadership team, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors and specifically, our Board’s Technology Committee, is to design and implement processes to identify, prioritize, assess, monitor and manage enterprise-level risks associated with cybersecurity threats. We have a dedicated cybersecurity team that collaborates with compliance, privacy, legal, and other teams across the global organization to assess the cybersecurity risk landscape. \nOur cybersecurity oversight function, which is led by our \nChief Information Security Officer\n (CISO) and also includes our Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel, directly oversees the cybersecurity and risk management process, which incorporates input from personnel from different functions, levels, and operating regions to support a high level of visibility and accountability throughout the company and to incorporate multiple vantage points on risks and potential mitigations.\n \nThe cybersecurity oversight function meets at least quarterly to discuss key risks and to discuss mitigation strategies. The results of our cybersecurity team process are communicated to the leadership team and its risk & reputation committee (the RRC) at least quarterly\n.\n \n21\nThe Technology Committee of the Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity risks and receives cybersecurity reports from our CISO and regularly conducts in-depth cybersecurity discussions\n.\n Our CIO and CISO have extensive experience in the areas of cybersecurity and risk management. \nOur CISO has more than 20 years of experience in Information Technology, including cybersecurity leadership roles. Our CIO, who oversees the cybersecurity team and reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer, has over 20 years of experience in information technology strategy, services, operations, risk and cybersecurity for large global enterprises.\n \nCybersecurity risks are included in the risk universe that the RRC evaluates, with input from information security subject matter experts at the company, to assess top risks to the enterprise. The RRC process provides input into our strategic planning process, such as development of action plans to address and mitigate identified risks. \nIntegrating cybersecurity risk into the overall RRC process in this manner assists the company in identifying, assessing, and managing material cybersecurity risks.\nOur cybersecurity program is designed to be aligned with applicable industry standards and is assessed regularly by internal and external cybersecurity experts. The multifaceted nature of our cybersecurity measures includes aspects of prevention, detection, and response capabilities, employee training programs, threat intelligence monitoring, and the implementation of an array of technologies. \nWe have established processes to oversee and identify cybersecurity risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, which includes (i) the completion of due diligence before engaging with any third party, (ii) controls for response to mitigate any significant risks, and (iii) assessments and reviews during the course of the relationship.\n Additionally, we have ongoing partnerships with government and commercial cybersecurity experts to understand emerging cybersecurity threats.\nWe seek to detect and investigate suspected attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their occurrence and recurrence where practicable through changes or updates to our internal processes and tools; however, we still remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats. Our cyber incident response plan includes an escalation process if a cybersecurity incident meets specific rating criteria to trigger action designed to minimize potential disruptions and protect the integrity of our operations. The cyber incident response plan has been reviewed by external experts and is reviewed internally annually. We also conduct periodic cybersecurity tabletop exercises where we perform walkthroughs of cyber incident scenarios with senior management to test and enhance preparedness.\nDuring the year ended June 28, 2025, \nthe company has not identified risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably anticipated to materially affect the company, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Nevertheless, the company recognizes cybersecurity threats are ongoing and evolving and has seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency and sophistication.\n We are committed to supporting the governance and oversight of cybersecurity risks and to implementing mechanisms, controls, technologies, and processes designed to help the company assess, identify, and manage these risks.
