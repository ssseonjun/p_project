  "item1_summary": " Any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations . The risks are organized by headings and each risk is described separately, many risks are interrelated . While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors, there may be additional risks that are not presently known .\n Inflation, increased interest rates, and other economic conditions including potential recession and credit market disruptions, could negatively impact our business . It may become more costly or difficult to obtain debt or equity financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to refinance our debt in the future, in each case on terms and within a time period acceptable .\n The global economy has been negatively impacted by geopolitical conflicts, and related export controls and economic sanctions, including the continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and rising tensions elsewhere including between China and Taiwan . Continued weak economic conditions may adversely impact consumers causing a decrease in demand for our products from our customers and consumers .\n Further escalations of geopolitical tensions related to military conflicts could also result in cyberattacks, supply or distribution disruptions, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets . In addition to the effects of the ongoing conflicts could heighten many of our known risks described in this article, the company said ."
