    "item1": "Item 1.        \nBusiness\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in California in 1982, became a public company in 1994, and were reincorporated in Delaware in January 2012. Our principal executive offices are located at 14185 Dallas Parkway, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75254 and our telephone number is (972) 391-5000. Our website is \nwww.copart.com\n. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. We provide free of charge, through a link on our website, access to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practical after the reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. \nCopart\n®\n, BID4U\n®\n, CI & Design\n®\n, DRIVE Auto Auctions\n™\n, 1-800 CAR BUYER\n®\n, CA$HFORCARS.COM\n®\n, COPART & DESIGN\n®\n, VB3 & DESIGN\n®\n, VB3\n®\n, National Powersports Auctions\n™\n, NPA\n™\n, Purple Wave Auction\n™\n, and CrashedToys.com\n®\n are trademarks of Copart, Inc. or one of its direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. This Form 10-K also includes other trademarks of Copart and of other companies.\nOverview\nWe are a leading global provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the United States (“U.S.”), the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Germany, Brazil, Canada, the United Arab Emirates (“U.A.E.”), Spain, Finland, Oman, the Republic of Ireland, and Bahrain. \nOur goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders, while also providing environmental and social benefits for the world around us. With respect to our environmental stewardship, we believe our business is a critical enabler for the global re-use and recycling of vehicles, parts, and raw materials. We are not responsible for the carbon emissions resulting from new vehicle manufacturing, governmental fuel emissions standards or vehicle use by consumers. Each vehicle that enters our business operations already exists, with whatever fuel technology and efficiency it was designed and built to have, and the substantial carbon emissions associated with the vehicle’s manufacture have already occurred. However, upon our receipt of an existing vehicle, we help facilitate the decrease of its total environmental impact by extending its useful life and thereby avoiding the carbon emissions associated with the alternative of new vehicle and auto parts manufacturing. For example, many of the cars we process and remarket are subsequently restored to drivable condition, reducing the new vehicle manufacturing burden the world would otherwise face. Many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers, who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs, again reducing new and aftermarket parts manufacturing. Finally, some of our vehicles are returned to their raw \n1\nTable\n of Contents\nmaterial inputs through scrapping, thereby reducing the need for further new resource extraction. In each of these cases, our business facilitates the reduction of the carbon and other environmental footprint of the global transportation industry. \nBeyond our environmental stewardship, we also support the world’s communities in two important ways. First, we believe that we contribute to economic development and well-being by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world. For example, many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education, health care, and well-being. Secondly, we believe we play an important role in the communities we serve through our response to and management of catastrophic weather events. This includes our investments in equipment and infrastructure which support our overall disaster recovery efforts. For example, we mobilized our people, and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve, store, and remarket tens of thousands of flood-damaged vehicles in South Florida in the wake of Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the fall of 2024. \nWe provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our Virtual Bidding Third Generation internet auction-style sales technology, which we refer to as VB3. Vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies, but also include dealers, individuals, charities, rental car companies, banks, finance companies, and fleet operators. We obtained 81%, 81%, and 83% of the total number of vehicles processed during fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, from insurance company sellers. We sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers, exporters, and to the general public. The majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss; not economically repairable by the insurance companies; or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made. We offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process, minimize administrative and processing costs, and maximize the ultimate sales price through the online auction process. \nIn the U.S., Canada, Brazil, the Republic of Ireland, Finland, the U.A.E., Oman, and Bahrain, we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from auction and auction-related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services as well as fees for services subsequent to the auction, such as delivery and storage. In the U.K., Germany, and Spain we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis, in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles for our own account. In the U.K., we recognize revenue on a principal basis from selling dismantled parts through Green Parts Specialist (“GPS”). In Germany we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value and/or to facilitate a sale for the insured. \nThrough our VB3 auction platform, our sales process is open to registered buyers (whom we refer to as “members”) anywhere in the world with access to the internet. This technology and model employ a two-step bidding process. The first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows members to enter bids over the internet during the preview period. To improve the effectiveness of bidding, the VB3 system lets members see the current high bids on the vehicles they want to purchase. The preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to eBay\n®\n. Members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and VB3’s BID4U feature incrementally bids on the vehicle on their behalf during all phases of the auction. Preliminary bidding ends at a specified time prior to the start of a second bidding step, an internet-only virtual auction. This second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder. The bidders enter bids via the internet in real time while BID4U submits bids for the high preliminary bidder up to their maximum bid. When bidding stops, a countdown is initiated. If no bids are received during the countdown, the vehicle sells to the highest bidder.\nWe believe our virtual auction platform increases the pool of available buyers for each sale, which brings added competition and an increase in the amount that buyers are willing to pay for vehicles. We also believe that it improves the efficiency of our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements which would be associated with holding live auctions. \nFor fiscal 2025, sales of U.S. vehicles, on a unit basis, to members registered outside the state where the vehicle was located accounted for 69.8% of total vehicles sold; of which 31.0% of vehicles were sold to out of state members within the U.S. and 38.8% were sold to International members, based on the IP address utilized during the auction process.\nWe believe that we offer the highest level of service in the auction and vehicle remarketing industry and have established our leading market position by:\n•\nproviding a virtual platform that facilitates seller access to buyers around the world, reducing towing and third-party storage expenses, offering a local presence for vehicle inspection stations, and providing prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters by specially trained teams;\n2\nTable\n of Contents\n•\nproviding a comprehensive range of services that includes merchandising, efficient title processing, timely pick-up and delivery of vehicles, and internet sales;\n•\nestablishing and efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions;\n•\nincreasing the number of bidders that can participate at each sale through the ease and convenience of internet bidding; and\n•\napplying technology to enhance operating efficiency through internet bidding, web-based order processing, salvage value quotes, electronic communication with members and sellers, and vehicle imaging.\nHistorically, we believe our business has grown as a result of (i) acquisitions, (ii) increases in overall volume in the salvage car market, (iii) growth in market share, (iv) increases in the amount of revenue generated per sales transaction resulting from increases in the gross selling price and the addition of value-added services for both members and sellers, and (v) growth in non-insurance company sellers. For fiscal 2025, our revenues were $4.6 billion, and our operating income was $1.7 billion.\nIn fiscal 2023, we opened one new operational facility in Brazil, one new operational facility in Germany, one new operational facility in Canada, and eight new operational facilities in the U.S.\nIn fiscal 2024, we opened three new operational facilities in the U.K., one new operational facility in Spain, one new operational facility in Canada, and four new operational facility in the U.S.\nIn fiscal 2025, we opened one new operational facility in the U.K., two new operational facilities in Spain, and three new operational facilities in the U.S.\nOur service revenues consist of auction and auction-related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services. These auction and auction-related services may include a combination of the following: vehicle purchasing fees: vehicle listing fees; vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price, tiered vehicle sales price fees, or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle; transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility; title processing and preparation fees; vehicle storage fees; bidding fees; and vehicle loading fees. These fees are recognized as net revenue (not gross vehicle selling price) at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged. Purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicles which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own. We have certain contracts with insurance companies, primarily in the U.K., in which we act as a principal, purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account. We also purchase vehicles in the open market, primarily from individuals, and resell them for our own account.\nOperating costs consist primarily of: (i) labor (operating personnel at facilities); (ii) transportation (miles traveled and fuel rates); (iii) facilities (maintenance, property-related taxes, rent, and insurance); (iv) other (marketing and auction-related costs); and (v) costs of vehicles sold. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management, accounting, data processing, sales personnel, professional services, marketing expenses, and technology enhancements and maintenance.\nIndustry Overview\nThe auction and vehicle remarketing services industry provides a venue for sellers to dispose of or liquidate vehicles to a broad domestic and international buyer pool. Sellers generally auction or sell their vehicles on a consignment basis either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price. Occasionally, companies in our industry purchase vehicles from the largest segment of sellers, insurance companies, and resell the vehicles for their own account. The vehicles are usually purchased at a price based on the vehicles’ estimated pre-accident value (“PAV”) and the extent of damage. Vehicle remarketers typically operate from multiple facilities where vehicles are processed, viewed, stored and released to the buyer. While companies in this industry remarket vehicles through a physical auction or a hybrid internet and physical auction, we sell virtually all our vehicles on our virtual marketplace platform VB3, thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location to participate in the sales process.\nAlthough there are other sellers of vehicles, such as dealers, individuals, charities, rental car companies, banks, finance companies, and fleet operators, our primary sellers of vehicles are insurance companies.\nThe primary buyers of vehicles at our auctions are vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers, exporters, and the general public. Vehicle dismantlers, which we believe are the largest group of vehicle buyers, based on volume of vehicles purchased, either dismantle a salvage vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders, used vehicle dealers, or the general public. Vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase \n3\nTable\n of Contents\nsalvage vehicles to repair and resell. Used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale.\nMost of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident or a natural disaster. Typically, the damaged vehicle is towed to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination. The vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster, who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage, options, and condition in order to estimate its PAV. The adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs, vehicle’s salvage value, and the PAV, as well as customer service considerations. If the cost of repair is greater than the PAV less the estimated salvage value, the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss. The insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company, settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle.\nAutomobile manufacturers continuously incorporate new standard features, including: unibody construction utilizing exotic metals; passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts; plastic and ceramic components; airbags; adaptive headlights; computer and navigation systems; advanced cameras, including backup camera systems; collision warning systems; dynamic cruise control; lane departure warning systems; automatic braking; blind spot detection systems; and electrification of drivetrains. We believe that one effect of these additional features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair and, accordingly, more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes.\nWe believe the primary factors that insurance companies consider when selecting an auction and vehicle remarketing services company include:\n•\nthe anticipated percentage return on salvage (i.e., gross salvage proceeds, minus vehicle handling and selling expenses, divided by the PAV);\n•\nthe services provided by the company and the degree to which such services reduce their administrative costs and expenses;\n•\nthe price the company charges for its services;\n•\nthe ability to respond to natural disasters;\n•\ngeographic coverage;\n•\nthe ability to provide analytical data to the seller; and\n•\nin the U.K., in certain situations, the actual amount paid for the vehicle.\nIn the U.K., some insurance companies tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles. Under these circumstances, insurance companies will generally award the contract to the company that is willing to pay the highest price for the vehicles.\nGenerally, upon receipt of the pickup order or the assignment, we arrange for the transportation of a vehicle to our nearest facility. As a service to the vehicle seller, we will customarily pay advance charges (reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle sellers) to obtain the vehicle’s release from a towing company, vehicle repair facility, or impound facility. Advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle seller are either recovered upon sale of the vehicle, invoiced separately to the seller, or deducted from the net proceeds due to the seller.\nThe salvage vehicle is stored at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency (“DMV”). In the U.S., total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the DMV. Upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the DMV, which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pick-up, the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company or for our own account, depending on the terms of the contract. In the U.K., upon release of interest by the vehicle owner, the insurance company notifies us that the vehicle is available for sale.\nGenerally, sellers of non-salvage vehicles will arrange to deliver the vehicle to one of our locations, although we may offer transportation services to obtain the vehicle. At that time, the vehicle information will be uploaded to our system and made available for buyers to review online. The vehicle is then sold at auction on VB3 typically within seven days. Proceeds are then collected from the member, typically seller fees are subtracted, and the remainder is remitted to the seller.\n4\nTable\n of Contents\nOperating and Growth Strategy\nOur growth strategy is to increase revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets, including foreign markets; (ii) pursuing global, national, and regional vehicle seller agreements; (iii) increasing our service offerings; and (iv) expanding the application of VB3 into new markets. In addition, we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures, and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures, integrating our management information systems, and redeploying personnel, when necessary.\nAs part of our overall expansion strategy, our objective is to increase our revenues, operating profits, and market share in the vehicle remarketing industry. To implement our growth strategy, we intend to continue to do the following:\nAcquire and Develop New Vehicle Storage Facilities in Key Markets Including Foreign Markets\nOur strategy is to offer integrated services to vehicle sellers on a global, national, or regional basis by acquiring or developing facilities in new and existing markets. We integrate our new acquisitions into our global network and capitalize on certain operating efficiencies resulting from, among other things, the reduction of duplicative overhead and the implementation of our operating procedures.\nPursue Global, National, and Regional Vehicle Supply Agreements\nOur broad global presence enhances our ability to enter into global, national, or regional supply agreements with vehicle sellers. We actively seek to establish supply agreements with insurance companies by promoting our ability to achieve high net returns and broader access to buyers through our national coverage and electronic commerce capabilities. By utilizing our existing insurance company seller relationships, we are able to build new seller relationships and pursue additional supply agreements in existing and new markets.\nExpand Our Service Offerings to Sellers and Members\nOver the past several years, we have expanded our available service offerings to vehicle sellers and members. The primary focus of these new service offerings is to maximize returns to our sellers and maximize product value to our members. This includes, for our sellers, real-time access to sales data over the internet, the ability to respond on a national scale, and for our members, the implementation of VB3 real-time bidding at substantially all of our facilities, thereby permitting members at any location worldwide to participate in the sales at our facilities. We plan to continue to refine and expand our services, including offering software that can assist our sellers in expediting claims and salvage management tools that help sellers integrate their systems with ours.\nOur Competitive Advantages\nWe believe that the following attributes and the services that we offer position us to take advantage of many opportunities in the online vehicle auction and services industry:\nGeographic Coverage and Ability to Respond on a Global Scale\nSince our inception in 1982, we have expanded from a single facility in Vallejo, California to an integrated network of facilities located in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Brazil, the Republic of Ireland, Germany, Finland, the U.A.E., Oman, Bahrain, and Spain. In Germany, we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value and/or to facilitate a sale for the insured. We offer integrated services to our vehicle sellers, which allow us to respond to the needs of our sellers and members with maximum efficiency. Our coverage provides our sellers with key advantages, including:\n•\nattractiveness and efficiency to buyers, leading to enhanced selling prices for vehicles;\n•\na reduction in administrative time and effort;\n•\na reduction in overall vehicle transportation costs;\n•\nconvenient local facilities;\n5\nTable\n of Contents\n•\nimproved access to buyers throughout the world;\n•\na prompt response in the event of a natural disaster or other catastrophe; and\n•\nconsistency in products and services.\nValue-Added Services\nWe believe that we offer the most comprehensive range of services in our industry, including:\n•\ninternet bidding, internet proxy bidding, and virtual sales powered by VB3, which enhance the competitive bidding process;\n•\nmobile applications, which allow members to search, bid, create watch lists, join auctions, and bid in numerous languages from anywhere;\n•\na tailored experience by way of predictive analytics through collaborative filtering, such as the Recommendations Engine feature that suggests similar makes and models based on a member’s behavior; \n•\nBuy It Now, which provides an option to our members to purchase specific pre-qualified vehicles immediately at a set price before the live auction process;\n•\nMake An Offer, which provides an option to our members to submit an offer amount on certain selected vehicles and if the offer is accepted, purchase the vehicle before the live auction process;\n•\nonline payment capabilities via our ePay product, credit cards, and third-party financing programs;\n•\nemail and text notifications available in numerous languages to potential buyers of vehicles that match desired characteristics;\n•\nsophisticated vehicle processing at storage sites, including digital imaging of each vehicle and the scanning of each vehicle’s title and other significant documents such as body shop invoices, all of which are available from us over the internet;\n•\nexpedited process to assess total loss through our Total Loss Express 360 and Co.ai tools;\n•\ntitle procurement and loan payoff services offered through Title Express; \n•\nspecialty sales, which allow buyers the opportunity to focus on such select types of vehicles as motorcycles, heavy equipment, boats, recreational vehicles, and rental cars;\n•\ninteractive online counter-bidding, which allows sellers who have placed a minimum bid or a bid to be approved on a vehicle to directly counter-bid the current high bidder; and\n•\nNight Cap sales, which provides an additional opportunity for bidding on vehicles that have not previously achieved their minimum bid.\nProven Ability to Acquire and Integrate Acquisitions\nWe have a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating facilities and companies. Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have completed acquisitions of facilities in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Brazil, the U.A.E., Germany, Finland, and Spain. As part of our acquisition and integration strategy, we seek to:\n•\nexpand our global presence;\n•\nstrengthen our networks and access new markets;\n•\nutilize our existing corporate and technology infrastructure over a larger base of operations; and\n•\nintroduce our comprehensive services and operational expertise.\n6\nTable\n of Contents\nWe strive to integrate all new facilities and companies, when appropriate, into our existing network without disruption of service to vehicle sellers. We typically retain existing employees at acquired facilities in order to retain knowledge about, and respond to, the local market. \nTechnology to Enhance and Expand Our Business\nWe have developed management information and proprietary software systems that allow us to deliver a fully integrated service offering. Our proprietary software programs provide vehicle sellers with online access to data and reports regarding their vehicles being processed at any of our facilities. This technology allows vehicle sellers to monitor each stage of our vehicle sales process, from pick up to sale and settlement by the buyer. Our full range of internet services allows us to expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process and helps to minimize the administrative and processing costs for us, as well as our sellers. We believe that our integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and financial returns for our clients, resulting in high client retention, and allow us to expand our national supply contracts.\nOur Business Segments\nOur U.S. and International regions are considered two separate operating segments and are disclosed as two reportable segments. The segments represent geographic areas and reflect how the chief operating decision maker allocates resources and measures results, including total revenues, operating income and income before income taxes. For the year ended July 31, 2025, we generated 83.0% of our revenue in our U.S. segment and 17.0% in our international segment. Geographic information as well as comparative segment revenues and related financial information pertaining to the U.S. and International segments for the years ended July 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 are presented in the tables in \nNote\n \n14 — Segments and Other Geographic Reporting\n, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOur Service Offerings\nWe offer vehicle sellers a full range of vehicle services, which expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process, helping to maximize proceeds and minimize costs. Not all service offerings are available in all markets. Additionally, in some cases a service offering may be applicable only to a particular subsidiary or operating segment. Our service offerings include the following:\nOnline Seller Access\nCopart Access, our proprietary internet-based service for vehicle sellers, provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to maximize efficiency and transparency throughout the sales process. This platform empowers sellers to seamlessly manage their inventory by assigning vehicles for sale, monitoring sales calendars, and accessing detailed vehicle information, including high-resolution images and historical data. Furthermore, Copart Access streamlines critical administrative functions such as viewing and reprinting body shop invoices and towing receipts, proactively managing the title procurement process, and optimizing total loss determination and management and the handling of unrelated/undisclosed damage. The platform also provides sellers with valuable insights into the historical performance of vehicles sold through our auctions, enabling data-driven decision-making and improved returns.\nSalvage Estimation Services\nWe offer Co.ai, a proprietary suite of total loss determination and valuation tools that leverage machine learning and computer vision to assist sellers in the vehicle claims evaluation process by providing online salvage value estimates, which helps sellers determine whether to repair a vehicle or deem it a total loss.\nIntelliSeller\nWe offer IntelliSeller, an automated tool leveraging our vast and detailed vehicle and sales data to assist our sellers in making vital auction decisions. Using machine learning, IntelliSeller optimizes the utilization of our vehicle and sales data to determine when to establish minimum bid values and suggest when to re-auction a unit to ensure optimal returns while minimizing cycle time. \nEstimating Services\n7\nTable\n of Contents\nWe offer vehicle sellers in the U.K. estimating services for vehicles taken to our facilities. Estimating services provide our insurance company sellers repair estimates, which allow the insurance company to determine if the vehicle is a total loss vehicle. If the vehicle is determined to be a total loss, it is generally assigned to us to sell.\nEnd-of-Life Vehicle Processing\nIn the U.K., we are an authorized treatment facility for the disposal of end-of-life vehicles.\nTransportation Services\nIn the U.S. segment, we perform transportation services through a combination of third-party vehicle transport companies and our fleet. We maintain contracts with third-party vehicle transport companies, which enable us to pick up most of our sellers’ vehicles within 24 hours. Our national network and transportation capabilities provide cost and time savings to our vehicle sellers and offer timely vehicle pick up and prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters in the U.S. In the International segment, we perform transportation services through a combination of our fleet and third-party vehicle transport companies. Our international network and transportation capabilities provide cost and time savings to our vehicle sellers throughout the U.K., Europe, Canada, Brazil and Middle East market. \nVehicle Inspection Stations\nWe offer some of our major insurance company sellers office and facility space to house vehicle inspection stations on-site at our facilities. We have over 100 vehicle inspection stations at our facilities. An on-site vehicle inspection station provides our insurance company sellers with a central location to inspect potential total loss vehicles, which reduces storage charges that otherwise may be incurred at the initial storage or repair facility.\nOn-Demand Reporting\nWe provide vehicle sellers with real time data for vehicles that we process for the seller. This includes vehicle sellers’ gross and net returns on each vehicle, service charges, and other data that enable our vehicle sellers to more easily administer and monitor the vehicle disposition process. In addition, we have developed a database containing over 300 fields of real-time and historical information accessible by our sellers allowing for their generation of custom ad hoc reports and customer specific analysis.\nTitle Processing\nWe have extensive expertise in DMV document and title processing. We have developed a computer system which provides a direct link to the DMV computer systems of multiple states, allowing us to expedite the processing of vehicle title paperwork. \nTitle Express\nWe also facilitate the title transfer from the original owner or financial institutions on behalf of some of our sellers to streamline the documentation and vehicle auction process.\nLoan Payoff\nWe can obtain up-to-date loan payoff information electronically from hundreds of automotive lenders, including the remaining balance due and per diem on a vehicle loan, to expedite the loan payoff and title transfer process. \nFlexible Vehicle Processing Programs\nAt the election of the seller, we sell vehicles pursuant to our Percentage Incentive Program (“PIP”), Consignment Program, or Purchase Program. Under each program we may provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from weather, washing vehicle exteriors, vacuuming vehicle interiors, cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires, making keys for drivable vehicles, and identifying drivable vehicles. We believe our merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of the vehicles, thereby increasing the return on vehicles to both vehicle sellers and us.\nPercentage Incentive Program.\n Under PIP, we agree to sell all of the vehicles of a seller in a specified market, usually for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price. Because our revenues under PIP are directly linked to the vehicle’s sale \n8\nTable\n of Contents\nprice, we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to maximize the net return. We provide the vehicle seller, at our expense, with transportation of the vehicle to our nearest facility. \nConsignment Program.\n Under our Consignment Program, we sell vehicles for a fixed consignment fee. Although sometimes included in the consignment fee, we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our nearest facility, storage of the vehicle, and other incidental costs.\nPurchase Program.\n Under the Purchase Program, we purchase vehicles from a vehicle seller at a formula price, based on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated PAV, and sell the vehicles for our own account. Currently, the purchase program is offered primarily in the U.K.\nBuy It Now, Make An Offer\nWe offer an option to our members to purchase specific pre-qualified vehicles immediately at a set price before the live auction process. This enables us to provide a fast, easy, transparent and comprehensive buying option on these pre-qualified vehicles. Additionally, members have the option of submitting an offer amount on certain selected vehicles. If an offer is accepted, the member can purchase the vehicle before the live auction process.\nSales Process\nWe offer a flexible and unique sales process designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles utilizing VB3. VB3 opens our sales process to members and the general public to view auctions via our website and our mobile application anywhere in the world where internet access is available. The VB3 technology and model employs a two-step bidding process. The first step is an open preliminary bidding feature that allows a member to enter bids over the internet during the preview days. To improve the effectiveness of bidding, the VB3 system lets a member see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase. The preliminary bidding step is an open bid format similar to eBay\n®\n. Members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and VB3’s BID4U feature will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf during all steps of the auction. Preliminary bidding ends at a specified time prior to the start of a second bidding step, an internet-only virtual auction. This second step allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the highest preliminary bidder. The bidders enter bids via the internet in real time, and then BID4U submits bids for the highest preliminary bidder, up to their maximum bid. When bidding stops, a countdown is initiated. If no bids are received during the countdown or any extensions, the vehicle sells to the highest bidder.\nBluCar\nWe provide financial institutions, fleet and rental car companies with an efficient method to sell their vehicles. We have a dedicated team of employees that support the processing of BluCar vehicles which includes market specific services such as asset recovery, comprehensive condition reports and arbitration.       \nCopart Dealer Services\nWe provide franchise and independent dealers with a convenient method to sell their trade-ins through any of our facilities. We have a dedicated team of employees in the U.S. that target these dealers and work with them throughout the sales process.\nCash For Cars\nWe provide the general public with a fast and convenient method to sell their vehicles. Anyone can go to CashForCars.com; CashForCars.ca; CashForCars.de, CashForCars.co.uk, or Cash-for-cars.ie and arrange to obtain a valid offer to purchase their vehicle. Upon acceptance of our offer to purchase their vehicle, we provide them payment for their vehicle and then sell the vehicle on our own behalf.\nNational Powersport Auctions\nIn the U.S., we provide wholesale powersport vehicle remarketing services through live and online auction platforms to dealers, financial institutions and Original Equipment Manufacturers through our subsidiary National Powersport Auctions (“NPA”). Powersports include for example motorcycles, recreational vehicles, boats and RVs. NPA also offers comprehensive data services including the NPA Value Guide\nTM\n, which we believe is the industry’s most accurate wholesale valuation tool. NPA corporate offices are located in San Diego, California; and they operate from locations throughout the United States. \n9\nTable\n of Contents\nPurple Wave Inc.\nIn the U.S., through our majority ownership of Purple Wave Inc. (“Purple Wave”) we provide wholesale construction, agriculture, and fleet remarketing services through no-reserve online auctions at www.purplewave.com, selling such items directly from the sellers location. Purple Wave Inc. offers a range of services including appraisals, listings, marketing, and post auction shipping. The Purple Wave corporate office is located in Manhattan, Kansas.    \nCopart Recycling\nIn the U.K., we have two facilities for U-Pull It from which the public can purchase parts from salvaged and end-of-life vehicles. In general, the buyer is responsible for detaching the parts from the vehicle and any associated hauling or transportation of the parts after detachment. After the valuable parts have been removed by the buyer, the remaining parts and car body are sold for their scrap value. We also operate GPS which dismantles vehicles and sells used parts.\nCopart 360 \nWe pioneered posting vehicle images online for buyers in 2001, and we have been improving the technology to provide top quality photos since then. In July 2020, we enhanced online images and videos by launching Copart 360 (“C360”), our proprietary technology that captures clear 360-degree views of interiors and exteriors of cars, trucks, and vans across U.S. Copart locations. This capability was expanded to the U.K. in fiscal 2021. Interested buyers can view everything from the backseat to the dashboard to the tires by clicking the 360° icon under vehicle images on select lot details pages on Copart.com. Buyers can also zoom in and out or expand to full screen on computers or mobile devices.\nMembership Tiers\nWe now offer three tiers of membership Guest, Basic, and Premier, except for Copart U.K. where we offer only Guest, and Basic.\nGuest Member Benefits\nGuest members can sign up for free to add their favorite vehicles to their Watchlist, set up Vehicle Alerts to get notified when we add specific vehicles they’re looking for and view our inventory from their desktop computer or mobile device via our mobile application.\nBasic Member Benefits\nBasic member benefits include:\n•\nview multiple online auctions in real-time (live);\n•\nbid on one vehicle at a time without a deposit, or up to five with a deposit;\n•\nsave favorite searches; and\n•\nget access to member appreciation events.\nPremier Member Benefits \nPremier member benefits include all basic member benefits, as well as, the following:\n•\nbid on multiple vehicles at the same time;\n•\nget priority placement in phone and chat support; \n•\naccess the Virtual Queue which provides expedited service at our locations; and\n•\nget a complimentary safety vest (one per membership year) and water bottle at our locations.\n10\nTable\n of Contents\nSales\nWe process vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle sellers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2025, 2024, or 2023 and our business does not depend on any particular customer to remain profitable. We obtained 81%, 81%, and 83% of the total number of vehicles processed during fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, from insurance company sellers. \nWe typically contract with the national, regional or branch office of an insurance company, fleet, financial institutions, and rental car companies and other vehicle sellers. The agreements are customized to each vehicle seller’s needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of vehicles by differing methods. Our arrangements generally provide that we will sell vehicles generated by the vehicle seller in a designated geographic area.\nWe market our services to vehicle sellers through an in-house sales force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques, including personal sales calls, internet search engines, employee referrals, tow shop referrals, and participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions, targeted mailing of our sales literature, and telemarketing. We market our services to franchise and independent dealerships, as well as the general public. We may, when appropriate, provide vehicle sellers with detailed analysis of the net return on vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns on vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses.\nDuring our last three fiscal years, most of our revenue was generated within the U.S. and a majority of our long-lived assets are located within the U.S. Please see \nNote 14 — Segments and Other Geographic Reporting\n in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the geographic location of our sales and our long-lived assets.\nMembers\nWe maintain a database of approximately 1 million registered members (“buyers”) in the vehicle dismantling and recycling, rebuilding, used vehicle dealer and export industries, as well as members that are a part of the general public, where applicable. We believe that we have established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing members with a variety of programs and services. To become a registered member, a person or business must complete a basic application either online or through our mobile application. Before any member may purchase a vehicle, they must provide copies of current government issued photo identification. Additionally, business members must provide current business information, including copies of licenses, which may include vehicle dismantler, dealer, resale, repair or export licenses, and as needed, completed sales tax exemption certificates. Registration entitles a member to transact business at any of our auctions, subject to local licensing and permitting requirements. We may sell to the general public either directly or members may purchase a vehicle offered at Copart through a registered broker who meets local licensing and permitting requirements. Strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that will not result in a completed sale. We market to members online and via email notifications, sales notices, telemarketing, direct mail, in-location marketing, search engines, social media, radio, television, trade publications, and participation in trade show events.\nCompetition\nWe face significant competition from other remarketers of both salvage and non-salvage vehicles. Against these other vehicle remarketers, we face competition for long-term contractual commitments and various supply agreements with sellers, in addition to competition for the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities. We believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers. These national, regional, and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle sellers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours. The largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in the U.S. include RB Global (including its subsidiary Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc.), Carvana, Openlane, Manheim, Inc. and ACV Auctions Inc. The largest national dismantler in the U.S. is LKQ Corporation (“LKQ”). LKQ, in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the American Recycling Association, United Recyclers Group LLC and other regional and local dismantlers, may purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies, thereby bypassing vehicle remarketing companies like Copart entirely. In our International markets, our principal competitors are vehicle auction and sales companies, vehicle dismantlers, and privately-held independent remarketers.\nManagement Information Systems\nOur primary management information system runs on a platform called G2, an integrated mesh of proprietary, distributed systems that is based on services architecture and open standards. A portion of the functionality still resides in the legacy system called CAS. \n11\nTable\n of Contents\nEmployees from various facilities, support centers and offices around the world access the G2 platform to perform various activities like take pictures, receive vehicles, inventory vehicles, process titles, accept payments, etc. Members access the G2 Platform to search for, view, bid and pay for the vehicles.  Sellers integrate their systems with Copart’s G2 Platform via B2B  Application Programming Interface “APIs”.  They also access G2 to assign vehicles, monitor the progression of a vehicle through the lot processing lifecycle, approve charges or bids and make and receive payments.\nWe have invested in multiple co-located data centers around the world and multiple cloud platforms to create a hybrid infrastructure that provides redundancy and is designed to run continuously, even in the event of an emergency. All our facilities, offices and employees connect to our servers through the internet using publicly available multiple networks, designed to provide redundancy. \nEmployees and Human Capital\nOur ability to build long-term value depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop, and motivate talented personnel at all levels within our global enterprise. Our employees are our greatest asset. Our goal is to create a strong culture built upon our foundational core values: act with integrity; be an owner; challenge the norm; get results; and celebrate our people. We have a diverse, multi-cultural workforce and we celebrate our diversity by promoting inclusion across our global organization.\nAs of July 31, 2025, we had approximately 11,600 full and part-time employees, of which approximately 64% were located in the U.S. and 36% were located within our International segment. \nOf the approximately \n7,400 \nfull and part-time employees based in the U.S, approximately 54% of them identify as male, 45% as female, and 1% are undisclosed. We also believe our U.S. workforce is ethnically diverse. As of July 31, 2025, our U.S. workforce consisted of approximately 48% individuals identifying as White, 3% as Hispanic or Latino,\n 14%\n as Black or African American, 6% as Asian, 3% as two or more races and 26% as other or as not disclosed.\nAdditionally, of the approximately 1,700 employees serving in the U.S. in management roles and above, up to and including executive\ns, 61%\n identify as male and 39% identify as female.\nOf the approximately 4,200 employees based within the International segment, approximately 65% of them identify as male and 35% as female. \nWe also believe our International workforce is ethnically diverse. As of July 31, 2025, our International workforce consisted of approximately 45% individuals identifying as White, 40% as Asian, 5% as Black or African, 3% as Hispanic or Latino, 0% as two or more races, 7% as other or as not disclosed.\nAdditionally, of the approximately 500 employees serving Internationally in management roles and above, up to and including executives, 70% identify as male and 30% identify as female.\nOur executive leadership team today reflects our commitment to inclusion. Among our three named executive officers (NEOs), our chief executive officer is ethnically diverse, and our chief financial officer is a woman. Within our broader executive management team, comprised of 11 executives with “chief” designations, two c-level executives are women and 5 are ethnically diverse.\nAt Copart, our human resources function known as People and Culture, plays a vital role in creating a supportive and productive work environment for all employees. Our People and Culture department is dedicated to fostering a culture of growth, collaboration, and employee well-being with a “people first” mindset. We understand that our people are our most valuable asset, and our People and Culture team is committed to providing comprehensive support across various aspects of the employee employment.\nWe identify and attract top talent that aligns with our values and objectives. We carefully manage the recruitment process, from drafting job descriptions and posting vacancies to conducting interviews and making hiring decisions. We leverage online search tools, recruiting firms, employee referral programs and university recruiting. We offer a combination of competitive salaries, equity incentives and bonus plans. \nOur Employee Development and Training Department plays a crucial role in driving organizational growth by equipping our employees with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed. This department designs and delivers comprehensive training from compliance to leadership development. By aligning training initiatives with corporate goals, the team ensures that employees are not only well-prepared to meet current job demands but are also future-ready. Through a blend of in-person sessions and virtual learning opportunities, the Training Department supports and promotes a culture of excellence, innovation, and career progression across the organization.\n12\nTable\n of Contents\nOur executive compensation structure aligns incentives with our company’s strategic growth objectives, including long-term share price appreciation. In that regard, our executive compensation programs place greater weighting on equity compensation than other forms of compensation offered to all employees. For more details regarding our executive compensation, refer to information incorporated by reference from the information set forth under the captions “Executive Compensation” and “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” in our proxy statement.\nOnce a new team member joins us, our People and Culture department works to provide for a seamless onboarding process, helping them integrate into our culture and hit the ground running.\nThe People and Culture team oversees performance management processes that help employees understand their goals and expectations. We facilitate regular performance discussions, feedback sessions, and goal setting to ensure alignment with our corporate objectives, driving a clear path to advancement.\nWe prioritize the well-being and satisfaction of our employees. We organize various engagement initiatives, including team-building events, wellness programs, and recognition efforts to celebrate achievements and milestones. We are dedicated to maintaining a positive and inclusive work environment where every employee feels valued and supported.\nWe provide comprehensive, generous benefits and compensation packages, ensuring that they remain competitive within the industry. We address inquiries about benefits, such as healthcare, retirement plans, and other rewards, to guarantee that our employees have access to the resources they need for a fulfilling work-life balance. Copart pays a sizable portion of the benefit premiums related to healthcare. Copart’s benefit plans are designed around health, financial security, life and education. These include a variety of medical plans, dental and vision coverage, and wellness programs in addition to external support networks.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to international, federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries in which we have storage facilities. In some cases, we may acquire land with existing environmental issues, including landfills as an example. In the salvage vehicle remarketing industry, large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities, requiring us to actively monitor and manage potential environmental impacts. In the U.K., we provide vehicle de-pollution and crushing services for end-of-life vehicles. We could incur substantial expenditures for preventative, investigative, or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations, contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future, or the disposal of our waste at off-site locations. In addition to conducting environmental diligence on new site acquisitions, we also take such appropriate actions as may be necessary to avoid liability for activities of prior owners, and we have from time to time acquired insurance with respect to acquired facilities with known environmental risks. There can be no assurances, however, that these efforts to mitigate environmental risk will prove sufficient if we were to face material liabilities. We have incurred expenses for environmental remediation in the past, and environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time. There can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future or that environmental enforcement agencies at the state and federal level will not pursue enforcement actions against us. In addition to acquiring insurance in connection with certain acquisitions, we have also obtained indemnification for pre-existing environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities, but there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be available or sufficient. In addition, increased focus by the U.S. and other governmental authorities on climate change and other environmental matters may lead to enhanced regulation in these areas, which could also result in increased compliance costs and subject us to additional potential liabilities. The extent of these costs and risks is difficult to predict and will depend in large part on the extent of new regulations and the ways in which those regulations are enforced. Any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. \nGovernmental Regulations\nOur operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various international, federal, provincial, state, and local statutes, ordinances and regulations that may impact our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. The acquisition and sale of vehicles is regulated by various state, provincial and foreign motor vehicle departments, and the steps required to process vehicle titles is a significant cost of our business. Our know-how in the area of title processing is a competitive advantage. In addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles, we are also subject to various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities, which generally make it more challenging and expensive to identify, acquire and develop new facilities. These zoning requirements vary from location to location. At various \n13\nTable\n of Contents\ntimes, we may be involved in disputes with governmental officials regarding the development and/or operation of our business facilities. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable regulatory requirements. We may be subject to similar types of regulations by international, federal, provincial, state, and local governmental agencies in new markets.\nIntellectual Property and Proprietary Rights\nIn 2008, we obtained a patent issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office that covers certain aspects of our virtual bidding auction platform, VB3. Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law.\nWe also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in technology and products. In seeking to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent, we routinely enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements with certain of our employees and consultants and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our consolidated results of operations have been subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, of which the primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns. During the winter months, we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weather-related accidents. Severe weather events, including but not limited to tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and hailstorms, can also impact our volumes.",

    "item1c": "Item 1C.    \nCybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe work proactively to identify, evaluate, and manage cybersecurity threats to our business.\n These threats include disruption and denial of critical systems and infrastructure, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to customers and employees, legal and litigation risks, reputational risks, and the breach of confidential business data, which could include personally identifiable information. We employ both holistic and focused processes for identifying, assessing, managing, and disclosing material cybersecurity risks to our business. Our holistic review is part of our general risk management process, and involves our executive leadership team, team members from our finance, legal, tech, and operations teams, and external legal, financial, and risk advisors who are subject matter experts in identifying, assessing, mitigating and reporting material risks. Our focused review involves internal assessment by our cybersecurity team, as well as external review by a cybersecurity consulting services firm, to evaluate our cybersecurity program and our capacity to defend against and respond to potential cybersecurity threats.\n \n27\nTable\n of Contents\nThrough strategic investments over several years, we have established and enhanced a comprehensive cybersecurity program consisting of security toolsets, people, policies, and contracted third-party service providers that provide technical, organizational, and administrative safeguards to protect against and timely respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents.\n Our cybersecurity strategy is based foremost on defense in depth, and secondarily on resilience. Defense in depth is a strategy of layered security, in which we employ a variety of overlapping controls, tools, and processes to defend against threat actors. Resilience is a strategy focused on business continuity and disaster recovery, with the goal of rapidly restoring, rebuilding, and recovering from any adverse cyber impacts to our business. These controls, tools and processes include technologies designed to detect and defend against unauthorized access to our systems and infrastructure, relevant corporate policies, periodic cybersecurity and privacy training programs, and incident response protocols for preventing, detecting, responding to and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. We use the National Institute for Standards in Technology security framework to evaluate our cybersecurity controls, which we work to continuously enhance.\n \nWe face a number of cybersecurity risks in connection with our business.  Although such risks have not materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, we have experienced threats to our data and systems in the past, including malware and viruses.  For a description of the risks we face from cybersecurity threats that may affect us and how, see our risk factors under Part 1."
