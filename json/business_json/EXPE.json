    "item1": "Item 1, Business, under the caption “Market Opportunity and Business Strategy.” \nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 items and year over year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of the year ended December 31, 2022 items and the year over year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. All percentages within this section are calculated on actual, unrounded numbers.\nTrends\nStarting in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures to contain the virus, including government travel restrictions and quarantine orders, had an unprecedented impact on the global travel industry and materially and negatively impacted our business, financial results and financial condition. Travel was severely depressed during 2020, with reduced levels of new bookings. In 2021, we began to see a bookings recovery. In 2022, there was a strong, but uneven, recovery in travel demand with different regions around the world experiencing different rates of recovery. In 2023, the overall reopening of the \n29\nTable of Contents\nAsia-Pacific region and general recovery outside of the United States was a factor in the gross bookings year-over-year growth rate for our B2B segment, but any other lingering impacts of the pandemic did not have a significant impact on our businesses, and we expect that to remain the case for future periods. \nMore recently, inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. and the global economy, such as interest rates, and currency fluctuations and energy price volatility, as well as evolving geopolitical conflicts, have contributed to an increasingly complex business environment. Our future operational results may be subject to volatility, particularly in the short-term, due to the impact of the aforementioned trends. Broad, sustained negative economic impacts could put strain on our suppliers, business and service partners, which increases the risk of credit losses and service level or other disruptions.\nAdditionally, further health-related events, political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency values, sustained levels of increased inflation, sovereign debt issues, and natural disasters, are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future. \nDespite these factors, we have witnessed a healthy but more normalized travel demand environment in 2024, as consumers continue to prioritize spend on travel and experiences over other discretionary spending. \nFor additional information about our business strategy for Expedia Group, see the disclosure set forth in Part I. Item 1. Business, under the caption “Market Opportunity and Business Strategy.” \nOnline Travel\nIncreased usage and familiarity with the internet have continued to drive rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures. Online penetration is higher in the U.S. and Western European markets with online penetration rates in some emerging markets, such as Latin America and Eastern European regions, lagging behind those regions. Emerging markets continue to present an attractive growth opportunity for our business, while also attracting many competitors to online travel. The industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. In addition to the growth of online travel agencies, we have seen continued interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies such as Google, evidenced by continued product enhancements, and prioritizing its own AdWords and metasearch products such as Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights, in search results. Competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies, including Kayak.com (owned by Booking Holdings), trivago (in which Expedia Group owns a majority interest) as well as TripAdvisor, introduced differentiated features, pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies, as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools. Further, airlines and lodging companies are aggressively pursuing direct online distribution of their products and services. In addition, the increasing popularity of the “sharing economy,” accelerated by online penetration, has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry. Businesses such as Airbnb, Vrbo and Booking.com have emerged as the leaders, bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market. Other competitors have arisen, including vacation rental property managers, who operate their own booking sites in addition to listing on Airbnb, Vrbo, and Booking.com. Additionally, traditional consumer ecommerce players have expanded their local offerings by adding hotel offers to their websites. Ride sharing app Uber has added transportation and experience offerings to its app via partnerships with other travel providers. Our B2B business has grown significantly but faces competition from other OTAs with B2B offerings, as well as other competitors, such as independent B2B businesses.\nThe online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers, which in some cases place pressure on historical business models. In particular, the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in Europe. Expedia Group facilitates both merchant (Expedia Collect) and agency (Hotel Collect) hotel offerings with our hotel supply partners through both agency-only contracts as well as our hybrid ETP program, which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay Expedia Group at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay.\nFor more detail, see Part I,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A, Risk Factors - “A failure to comply with current laws, rules, and regulations or changes to such laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business, financial performance, results of operations or business growth,” “Application of existing tax laws, rules, or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities,” and “We could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities.”\nDefinition and Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA\nWe report Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Adjusted EBITDA is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above, in the Legal Proceedings section, as well as the notes to the financial statements. The non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. adjusted for (1) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests; (2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net; (4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (5) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, if any, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree, if any; (6) certain other items, including restructuring; (7) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other; (8) that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized in the period; and (9) depreciation.\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. In addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe reconciliation of net income attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nYear ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nNet income attributable to Expedia Group, Inc.\n$\n1,234 \n$\n797 \n$\n352 \nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests\n(10)\n(109)\n(9)\nProvision for income taxes\n318 \n330 \n195 \nTotal other (income) expense, net\n(223)\n15 \n547 \nOperating income\n1,319 \n1,033 \n1,085 \nGain (loss) on revenue hedges related to revenue recognized\n(18)\n(7)\n(6)\nRestructuring and related reorganization charges, excluding stock-based compensation\n72 \n— \n— \nLegal reserves, occupancy tax and other\n118 \n8 \n23 \nStock-based compensation\n458 \n413 \n374 \nDepreciation and amortization\n838 \n807 \n792 \nImpairment of goodwill\n— \n297 \n— \nImpairment of intangible assets\n147 \n129 \n81 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n2,934 \n$\n2,680 \n$\n2,349 \nFinancial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are typically cash flows generated from operations, cash available under our credit facility as well as our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, which were $4.5 billion and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $2.5 billion was essentially untapped at December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States was $625 million ($472 million in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and $153 million in majority-owned subsidiaries). Most of our foreign undistributed earnings have already been subject to U.S. federal income tax. We do not assert indefinite reinvestment on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. \nOur credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. As of December 31, 2024, Moody’s rating was Baa2 with an outlook of “stable,” S&P’s rating was BBB with an outlook of “stable” and Fitch’s rating was BBB- with an outlook of “positive.” In January 2025, Fitch upgraded our credit rating from BBB- to BBB with a “stable” outlook.\" Changes in our operating results, cash flows, financial position, capital structure, financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase, dividends, investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. Should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur higher costs to borrow and/or limited access to capital markets and interest rates on our 6.25% senior notes, 4.625% senior notes as well as our 2.95% senior notes will increase, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt as detailed in NOTE 7 — Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \nUnder the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. We pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction. For most other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant lodging business, we generally pay after the travelers’ use and, in some cases, subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers. Therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. Typically, the seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings have affected the timing of our annual cash flows. Generally, during the first half of the year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. During the second half of the year, this pattern typically reverses and cash flows are typically negative. \n42\nTable of Contents\nOur cash flows are as follows:\n \nYear ended December 31, \n$ Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023\n2023 vs 2022\n \n(In millions)\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n3,085 \n$\n2,690 \n$\n3,440 \n$\n395 \n$\n(750)\nInvesting activities\n(1,262)\n(800)\n(580)\n(462)\n(220)\nFinancing activities\n(1,745)\n(2,096)\n(2,624)\n351 \n528 \nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(165)\n16 \n(190)\n(181)\n206 \nIn 2024, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $395 million primarily due to higher operating income after adjusting for impacts from depreciation, amortization and intangible asset impairments as well as increased benefits from working capital changes, including growth in deferred merchant bookings. These benefits were partially offset by Italian VAT settlement payments and restructure payments in the current year.\nIn 2024, we had net cash used in investing activities of $1.3 billion compared to $800 million in the prior year. The change was primarily due to net purchases of investments in 2024 compared to net sales and maturities of investments in the prior year, partially offset by lower current year capital expenditures.\nCash used in financing activities in 2024 primarily included $1.8 billion of cash paid to acquire shares, including the repurchased shares under repurchase programs and for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments, partially offset by $116 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. Cash used in financing activities in 2023 primarily included payments of $2.1 billion of cash paid to acquire shares, including the repurchased shares under repurchase programs discussed below and for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments, partially offset by $101 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. \nIn 2018 and 2019, the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee of the Board, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Board, authorized a program to repurchase up to 15 million shares and 20 million shares of our common sto\nck (the “2018 Share Repurchase Program” and the “2019 Share Repurchase Program”). \nIn October 2023, the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Board, authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock (“2023 Share Repurchase Program”). The 2018 and 2019 Share Repurchase Programs have been completed. Our 2023\n \nShare Repurchase Program does not have fixed expiration dates and does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be subject to the discretion of the Company and depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of Expedia Group’s common stock, general market and economic conditions, regulatory requirements and other business considerations. Shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows:\n \nYear ended December 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumber of shares repurchased\n12.1 million\n19.1 million\n5.2 million\nAverage price per share\n$\n133.85 \n$\n106.07 \n$\n96.09 \nTotal cost of repurchases (in millions)\n(1)\n$\n1,616 \n$\n2,031 \n$\n500 \n \n______________________________________\n(1)\nAmount excludes transaction costs and excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $3.2 billion remain authorized for repurchase under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we didn't pay any common stock dividends. On February 3, 2025, the Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of quarterly common stock dividends, and on February 4, 2025, the Executive Committee, acting on behalf of the Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of outstanding common stock payable on March 27, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 6, 2025. Future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination by our Board of Directors.\nForeign exchange rate changes resulted in a decrease of our cash and restricted cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2024 of $165 million reflecting a net depreciation in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar during the year. Foreign exchange rate changes resulted in an increase of our cash and restricted cash balances denominated in foreign currency in  2023 of $16 million reflecting a net appreciation in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar during the year. \n43\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. \nOur material cash requirements as of December 31, 2024 include the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising in the normal course of business:\n•\nPrincipal payments related to our debt that is included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments. The Company had Senior Notes and Convertible Notes, as described in NOTE 7 — Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, with varying maturities and an aggregate principal amount of $6.3 billion, $1 billion of which is payable within 12 months. On January 24, 2025, Expedia Group provided notice that we would redeem all of our approximately $1 billion in 6.25% Senior Notes due 2025 with a stated redemption date of February 8, 2025. Based on current stated fixed rates, future interest payments associated with the Senior Notes total approximately $645 million, with approximately $198 million payable within 12 months;\n•\nOur operating leases had fixed lease payment obligations, including imputed interest, of $371 million, with $74 million payable within 12 months; and\n•\nPurchase obligations representing the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing partners. These minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods, and payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use. The Company had purchase obligations of $495 million, with $252 million payable within 12 months.\nIn addition, we had $331 million of net unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. \nSee NOTE 15 — Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our purchase obligations as well as amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2024 related to letters of credit and guarantees. Other than the items described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2024.\nIn our opinion, our liquidity position provides sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable cash needs. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, including refinancings, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us.\nCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\nFor a discussion of certain relationships and related party transactions, see NOTE 16 — Related Party Transactions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nSummarized Financial Information for Guarantors and the Issuer of Guaranteed Securities\nSummarized financial information of Expedia Group, Inc. (the “Parent”) and our subsidiaries that are guarantors of our debt facility and instruments (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”) is shown below on a combined basis as the “Obligor Group.” The debt facility and instruments are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The guarantees are full, unconditional, joint and several with the exception of certain customary automatic subsidiary release provisions. In this summarized financial information of the Obligor Group, all intercompany balances and transactions between the Parent and Guarantor Subsidiaries have been eliminated and all information excludes subsidiaries that are not issuers or guarantors of our debt facility and instruments, including earnings from and investments in these entities. \nDecember 31, 2024\n \n(In millions)\nCombined Balance Sheets Information:\n     Current Assets\n$\n7,996 \n     Non-Current Assets\n10,495 \n     Current Liabilities\n(1)\n14,129 \n     Non-Current Liabilities\n5,744 \nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nCombined Statements of Operations Information:\n     Revenue\n$\n10,520 \n     Operating income \n(2)\n915 \n     Net income\n719 \n     Net income attributable to Obligors\n729 \n44\nTable of Contents\n(1)\nCurrent liabilities include intercompany payables with non-guarantors of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n(2)\nOperating income includes intercompany income with non-guarantors of $710 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nPart II. Item 7A.\n \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices. Our exposure to market risk includes our long-term debt, our revolving credit facilities, derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables, investments, merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures. Our objective is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt was $6.3 billion. The aggregate principal of our debt included:\n•\n$1.044 billion of senior unsecured notes due May 2025 that bear interest at 6.25%;\n•\n$750 million of senior unsecured notes due February 2026 that bear interest at 5.0%;\n•\n$1 billion of convertible senior unsecured notes due February 2026 with a fixed rate of 0% (the “Convertible Notes”);\n•\n$750 million of senior unsecured notes due August 2027 that bear interest at 4.625%; \n•\n$1 billion of senior unsecured notes due February 2028 that bear interest at 3.8%; \n•\n$1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes due February 2030 that bear interest at 3.25%; and \n•\n$500 million of senior unsecured notes due March 2031 that bear interest at 2.95%. \nThe 6.25%, 5.0%, 4.625%, 3.8%, 3.25%, and 2.95% senior unsecured notes are collectively the “Senior Notes.” If market interest rates decline, our required payments will exceed those based on market rates. Additionally, the 6.25%, 4.625% and 2.95% senior unsecured notes are subject to interest rate adjustments should our credit ratings be adjusted downwards, which would result in increased interest expense in the future. The total estimated fair value of our Senior Notes and Convertible Notes was approximately $6.1 billion as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The fair value was determined based on quoted market prices in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $70 million.   \nWe maintain a revolving credit facility of $2.5 billion, which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings. Because our interest rate is tied to a market rate, we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if, consistent with our practice to date, we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. We had no revolving credit facilities borrowings outstanding as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe conduct business in certain international markets, primarily in Australia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. Because we operate in international markets, we have exposure to different economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses, which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations.\nTo the extent practicable, we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies. Additionally, we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. These instruments are typically short-term and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other, net. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had net forward liabilities of $2 million and $9 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future. Our goal in managing our foreign \n45\nTable of Contents\nexchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. We make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings, cancellations, refunds, customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies. In the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results, we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges.\nIn March 2022, we entered into two fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps (“the swaps”) with an aggregate notional amount of €300 million. The swaps were designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets with the objective to protect the U.S. dollar value of our net investments in the Euro foreign operations due to movements in foreign currency. During the term of each contract, we receive interest payments in U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of 5% and make interest payments in Euros at an average fixed rate of 3.38%. The maturity date of both swaps is February 2026, whereby, we will receive U.S. dollars from and pay Euros to the contract counterparties. The fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps was a $25 million asset as of December 31, 2024 and a $8 million asset as of December 31, 2023, recorded in long-term investments and other assets.\nFuture net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period, and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing, through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts, such exposures. As an example, if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10% against the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10% against the U.S. dollar, we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately $43 million based on our foreign currency forward positions (including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures) and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of December 31, 2024. As the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently, even daily, as do foreign exchange rates, the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately $66 million ($70 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue), net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately $85 million ($65 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue) and net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately $40 million ($37 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue), respectively. As we increase our operations in international markets, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases. The economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies.\nEquity Investment Risk\nWe are exposed to equity price risk as it relates to changes in fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies, investments in which we’ve elected the fair value option, and minority investments without readily determinable fair values. We recorded net gains (losses) of $289 million, $16 million, and $(345) million related to these investments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively (See NOTE 3 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information). The fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies (combined with our investments in which we’ve elected the fair value option) and minority investments without readily determinable fair values, were $895 million and $293 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024, and $584 million and $330 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair values at December 31, 2024 of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and minority investments without readily determinable fair values would have resulted in a loss, before tax, of approximately $119 million, being recognized within other, net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nPart II. Item 8. \nConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedule listed in the Index to Financial Statements, Schedules and Exhibits on page F-1 are filed as part of this report.\nPart II. Item 9. \nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nPart II. Item 9A. \nControls and Procedures\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), our management, including our Chairman and Senior Executive, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chairman and Senior Executive, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management has reviewed its assessment with the Audit Committee. Ernst & Young, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their report which is included below.\nLimitations on Controls.\nManagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\n47\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Expedia Group, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Expedia Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Expedia Group, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated \nFebruary 6, 2025\n expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nFebruary 6, 2025\n48\nTable of Contents\nPart II. Item 9B.\n \nOther Information\nRule 10b5-1 Plan Elections\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, \nnone\n of our directors or executive officers adopted, modified or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” as such terms are defined under Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\nPart II. Item 9C.\n \nDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdiction that Prevent Inspections\nNot Applicable.\nPart III.\nWe are incorporating by reference the information required by Part III of this report on Form 10-K from our proxy statement relating to our 2025 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2025 Proxy Statement”), which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 120 days after the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\nPart III. Item 10. \nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors and Senior Financial Officers (the “C\node of Ethics\n”) that applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer or Controller, and is a “code of ethics” as defined by applicable SEC rules.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes\n \n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 6, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nOne Key Loyalty Program\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, travelers enrolled in loyalty programs earn rewards with each eligible booking made which can be redeemed for free or discounted future bookings. Member consideration is allocated between travel services and rewards earned in the loyalty programs. The Company defers the relative standalone selling price of earned rewards, net of rewards not expected to be redeemed (known as “breakage”), as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. To estimate the relative standalone selling price for rewards, the Company considers the stated redemption value per reward dictated by the terms of the loyalty programs and then estimates the future breakage of rewards based on statistical modeling techniques using historical member activity. The deferred loyalty rewards balance, net of amounts paid to the travel supplier, is recognized as revenue when the travel service purchased with the loyalty reward is satisfied.\nF- 2\nTable of Contents\nAuditing the Company’s One Key deferred loyalty rewards program (\"One Key\") balance is especially complex and judgmental due to significant measurement uncertainty in determining the expected future breakage of rewards. Management uses statistical modeling techniques to estimate future breakage based on historical member activity. The amount of member consideration allocated to the rewards earned is sensitive to the expected future breakage assumption.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over Management’s review of the statistical modeling techniques and resulting breakage estimates for One Key deferred loyalty rewards. We also tested controls over the completeness and accuracy of member activity data used in the breakage estimate analyses. This included controls over the Company’s systems and the application controls involved in the process to track One Key loyalty reward member activity. \nTo test the One Key deferred loyalty rewards balance, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, involving our actuarial specialists to assist us in assessing the methods used by Management and to develop an independent actuarial estimate of a reasonable range of breakage rates. We then compared this reasonable range of breakage rates to the Company’s estimates. Additionally, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the member activity data used by our actuarial specialists in their breakage analyses. \n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the

to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 1 — \nOrganization and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nExpedia Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide travel products and services to leisure and corporate travelers in the United States and abroad as well as various media and advertising offerings to travel and non-travel advertisers. We leverage our supply portfolio, platform and technology capabilities across an extensive portfolio of consumer brands, including our three core consumer brands of Expedia®, Hotels.com®, and Vrbo® as well as trivago®, and provide solutions to our business partners, to empower travelers to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We refer to Expedia Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as “Expedia Group,” the “Company,” “us,” “we” and “our” in these consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include Expedia Group, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities we control, or in which we have a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary of expected cash profits or losses. We record our investments in entities that we do not control, but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, using the equity method or at fair value. We have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts. \nWe believe that the assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements are reasonable. However, these consolidated financial statements do not present our future financial position, the results of our future operations and cash flows.\nSeasonality\nWe generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. For example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. Since revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. Historically, Vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. The seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. As a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter.\n \nNOTE 2 — \nSignificant Accounting Policies \nConsolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Expedia Group, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities for which we control a majority of the entity’s outstanding common stock. We record non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements to recognize the minority ownership interest in our consolidated subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest in the earnings and losses of consolidated subsidiaries represent the share of net income or loss allocated to members or partners in our consolidated entities. trivago is a separately listed company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and, therefore, is subject to its own reporting and filing requirements, which could result in possible differences that are not expected to be material to Expedia Group, Inc.\nWe have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts in our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Estimates\nWe use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income or loss during any period. Our actual financial results could differ significantly from these estimates. The significant estimates underlying our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition; recoverability of current and long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; income and transactional taxes, such as potential settlements related to occupancy and excise taxes; loss contingencies; deferred loyalty rewards; stock-based compensation; accounting for derivative instruments and provisions for credit losses, and chargebacks.\n \nF- 9\nTable of Contents\nReclassifications\nWe have reclassified prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.\n \nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of our promised services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nFor our primary transaction-based revenue sources, discussed below, we have determined net presentation (that is, the amount billed to a traveler less the amount paid to a supplier) is appropriate for the majority of our revenue transactions as the supplier is primarily responsible for providing the underlying travel services and we do not control the service provided by the supplier to the traveler. We exclude all taxes assessed by a government authority, if any, from the measurement of transaction prices that are imposed on our travel related services or collected by the Company from customers (which are therefore excluded from revenue).\nWe offer traditional travel services on a stand-alone and package basis generally either through the merchant or the agency business model. \nUnder the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms, alternative accommodations, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings.\nUnder the agency model, we pass reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel supplier and the travel supplier serves as the merchant of record for such bookings. We receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier and/or traveler. For certain agency airline, hotel and car transactions, we also receive fees through global distribution systems (“GDS”) that provide the computer systems through which the travel supplier inventory is made available and through which reservations are booked.\nUnder the advertising model, we offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on trivago and our transaction-based websites.\nIn addition, Vrbo also provides subscription-based listing and other ancillary services to property owners and managers.\nThe nature of our travel booking service performance obligations vary based on the travel service with differences primarily related to the degree to which we provide post booking services to the traveler and the timing when rights and obligations are triggered in our underlying supplier agreements. We consider both the traveler and travel supplier as our customers.\nRefer to NOTE 17 — Segment Information for revenue by business model and service type.\nLodging. \nOur lodging revenue is comprised of revenue recognized under the merchant, agency and Vrbo subscription-based listing services model. \nMerchant Hotel. \nWe provide travelers access to book hotel room reservations through our contracts with lodging suppliers, which provide us with rates and availability information for rooms but for which we have no control over the rooms and do not bear inventory risk. Our travelers pay us for merchant hotel transactions prior to departing on their trip, generally when they book the reservation. We record the payment in deferred merchant bookings until the stayed night occurs, at which point we recognize the revenue, net of amounts paid to suppliers, as this is when our performance obligation is satisfied. Payments to suppliers are generally due within 30 days of check-in or stay. In certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience. Cancellation fees are collected and remitted to the supplier, if applicable.\nAgency Hotel. \nWe generally record agency revenue from the hotel when the stayed night occurs as we provide post booking services to the traveler and, thus consider the stay as when our performance obligation is satisfied. We record an allowance for cancellations on this revenue based on historical experience. \nMerchant and Agency Vrbo Alternative Accommodations. \nVrbo's lodging revenue is generally earned on a pay-per-booking basis, which can be either merchant or agency bookings depending on the nature of the payment processor. Pay-per-booking arrangements are commission-based where rental property owners and managers bear the inventory risk, have latitude in setting the price and compensate Vrbo for facilitating bookings with travelers. Under pay-per-booking arrangements, each booking is a separate contract as listings are typically cancelable at any time and the related revenue, net of amounts paid to property owners, is recognized at check in, which is the point in time when our service to the traveler is complete. Vrbo also charges a traveler service fee at the time of booking. The service fee charged to travelers provides compensation for Vrbo's services, including but not limited to the use of Vrbo's website and a “Book with Confidence Guarantee” providing travelers with comprehensive payment protection and 24/7 traveler support. The performance obligation is to facilitate the booking of a property and assist travelers up to their check in process and, as such, the traveler service fee revenue is recognized at check-in. \nF- 10\nTable of Contents\nSubscription-based Listing Services. \nTo a lesser extent, Vrbo's lodging revenue is also earned on a pay-per-subscription basis. In pay-per-subscription contracts, property owners or managers purchase in advance online advertising services related to the listing of their properties for rent over a fixed term (typically one year). As the performance obligation is the listing service and is provided to the property owner or manager over the life of the listing period, the pay-per-subscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the listing period.  \nMerchant and Agency Air. \nWe record revenue on air transactions when the traveler books the transaction, as we do not typically provide significant post booking services to the traveler and payments due to and from air carriers are typically due at the time of ticketing. We record a reserve for chargebacks and cancellations at the time of the transaction based on historical experience. In certain transactions, the GDS collects commissions from our suppliers and passes these commissions to us, net of their fees. Therefore, we view payments through the GDS as commissions from suppliers and record these commissions in net revenue. Fees paid to the GDS as compensation for their role in processing transactions are recorded as cost of revenue. \nAdvertising and Media\n. \nWe record revenue from click-through fees charged to our travel partners for leads sent to the travel partners’ websites. We record revenue from click-through fees after the traveler makes the click-through to the related travel partners’ websites. We record revenue for advertising placements ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of advertising impressions, depending on the terms of the contract. Payments from advertisers are generally due within 30 days of invoicing.\nOther. \nOther primarily includes transaction revenue for booking services related to products such as car, cruise and destination services under the agency business model. We generally record the related revenue when the travel occurs, as in most cases we provide post booking services and this is when our performance obligation is complete. Additionally, no rights or obligations are triggered in our supplier agreements until the travel occurs. We record an allowance for cancellations on this revenue based on historical experience. Revenue from other ancillary alternative accommodation services or products are recorded either upon delivery or when we provide the service. In addition, other also includes travel insurance products primarily under the merchant model, for which revenue is recorded at the time the transaction is booked. \nPackages. \nPackages assembled by travelers through the packaging functionality on our websites generally include a merchant hotel component and some combination of an air, car or destination services component. The individual package components are accounted for as separate performance obligations and recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies stated above. \nPrepaid Merchant Bookings. \nWe classify payments made to suppliers in advance of Vrbo performance obligations as prepaid merchant bookings included within prepaid and other current assets.\n Prepaid merchant bookings was $\n319\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n365\n million as of December 31, 2023.\nDeferred Merchant Bookings. \nWe classify cash payments received in advance of our performance obligations as deferred merchant bookings. \nAt December 31, 2023, $\n6.9\n billion of advance cash payments was reported within deferred merchant bookings, $\n5.8\n billion of which was recognized resulting in $\n917\n million of revenue\n \nduring the year ended December 31, 2024\n \nwith the remainder primarily consisting of cancellations during the year. At December 31, 2024, the related balance was $\n7.6\n billion. \nTravelers enrolled in our internally administered traveler loyalty rewards programs earn rewards for each eligible booking made which can be redeemed for free or discounted future bookings. One Key allows members to earn OneKeyCash, the currency of the One Key program, on eligible hotels, alternative accommodations, activities, packages, car rentals, flights and cruises made on the U.S. and U.K. points of sale on Brand Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo. Hotels.com Rewards continues to be offered outside the U.S. and U.K. and offers travelers one free night at any Hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions. Expedia Rewards also continues to be offered outside the U.S. and U.K. and enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel, flight, package and activities made on various international Brand Expedia websites. As travelers accumulate rewards towards free travel products, we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned rewards, net of expected breakage, as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. In order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which rewards can be redeemed for all loyalty programs, we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. We then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques. Revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the rewards, that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. The majority of rewards expected to be redeemed are recognized within \none\n to \ntwo years\n of being earned.\n At December 31, 2023, $\n871\n million of deferred loyalty rewards was reported within deferred merchant bookings, all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, the related balance was $\n937\n million. \nDeferred Revenue. \nDeferred revenue primarily consists of unearned subscription revenue as well as deferred advertising revenue.\n At December 31, 2023, $\n164\n million was recorded as deferred revenue, $\n131\n million of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, the related balance was $\n164\n million. \nF- 11\nTable of Contents\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions. \nWe have used the portfolio approach to account for our loyalty points as the rewards programs share similar characteristics within each program in relation to the value provided to the traveler and their breakage patterns. Using this portfolio approach is not expected to differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts. However, we will continue to assess and refine, if necessary, how a portfolio within each rewards program is defined. \nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.\nCash, Restricted Cash, and Cash Equivalents\nOur cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial instruments, including term deposit investments, certificates of deposits, and money market funds with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Restricted cash includes cash and cash equivalents that is restricted through legal contracts, regulations or our intention to use the cash for a specific purpose. Our restricted cash primarily relates to certain traveler deposits and, to a lesser extent, collateral for office leases.\n \nThe following table reconciles cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in our consolidated balance sheets to the total amount presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n4,183\n \n$\n4,225\n \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\n1,391\n \n1,436\n \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows\n$\n5,574\n \n$\n5,661\n \nShort-term and Long-term Investments\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. Investments, other than minority equity investments, classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (\"OCI\"). Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale investments, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. We review our available-for-sale securities on a regular basis for impairment. For available-for-sale securities in unrealized loss positions, we determine whether any portion of the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related factors if we neither intend to sell nor anticipate that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. We consider factors such as the extent to which the market value has been less than the cost, any noted failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments, changes to the rating of the security and other relevant credit-related factors in determining whether or not a credit loss exists. Investments with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments. All other investments are classified within long-term investments and other assets.\nMinority equity investments with either readily determinable fair values, or for which we have elected to apply the fair value option, are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded through net income or loss. Minority investments without readily determinable fair values, for which we have not elected to measure at fair value, are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with observable price changes reflected through net income or loss. We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value of minority equity investments are recorded in other income (expense), net.\n \nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are recorded net of an allowance for expected uncollectible amounts. We consider accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms as past due. The risk characteristics we generally review when analyzing our accounts receivable pools primarily include the type of receivable (for example, credit card vs hotel collect), collection terms and historical or expected credit loss patterns. For each pool, we make estimates of expected credit losses for our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, previous loss history continually updated for new collections data, the credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. The provision for estimated credit losses is recorded as cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\n \nF- 12\nTable of Contents\nProperty and Equipment\nWe record property and equipment at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. We also capitalize certain costs incurred related to the development of internal use software. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal use software. We expense costs incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development as incurred.\nWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is \nthree\n to \nfive years\n for computer equipment, capitalized software development and furniture and other equipment, \n15\n years for land improvements, and \n40\n years for buildings, which includes our corporate headquarters. Land is not depreciated. We amortize leasehold improvement using the straight-line method, over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to return certain of our leased facilities to their original condition under the authoritative accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated restoration costs.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are primarily for office space and data centers and are included in operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nFor operating leases with a term of one year or less, we have elected to not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Instead, we recognize the lease payments as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Short-term lease costs are immaterial to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows.\nWe have office space and data center lease agreements with insignificant non-lease components and have elected the practical expedient to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n \nBusiness Combinations\nWe assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names, and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Any changes to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.\nRecoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, neither of which is amortized, for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. Periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired. \nWe generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. Our significant \nF- 13\nTable of Contents\nestimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the Company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. \nWe believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis.\nIn addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the Company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. Our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. The debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument.\nIn our evaluation of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, we typically first perform a quantitative assessment and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair value, if necessary. We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. As with goodwill, periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired.\n \nRecoverability of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of \none\n to \nten years\n. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups, including property and equipment, to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\nAssets held for sale, to the extent we have any, are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities for each temporary difference are recorded based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. \nWe consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent earnings by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the tax attribute carryforward periods, as well as other relevant factors. We may record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we must make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria. The first step assesses whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority, including resolution of any appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. If the tax position meets the more \nF- 14\nTable of Contents\nlikely than not criteria, the tax benefit greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority is recognized in the financial statements.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line in our consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIn relation to tax effects for accumulated OCI, our policy is to release the tax effects of amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI to pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations. Any remaining tax effect in accumulated OCI is released following a portfolio approach.\n \n \nWe account for the global intangible low-tax income earned by our foreign subsidiaries included in gross U.S. taxable income in the period incurred.\n \nDerivative Instruments\nDerivative instruments are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments generally represent the estimated amounts we would expect to receive or pay upon termination of the contracts as of the reporting date.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, our derivative instruments primarily consisted of foreign currency forward contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. Our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce, to the extent practicable, our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. Our foreign currency forward contracts are typically short-term and, as they do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we classify the changes in their fair value in other, net and present associated cash flows within investing activities on the statement of cash flows. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nUntil their redemption in March 2022, the aggregate principal value of our €\n650\n million of registered senior unsecured notes that bore interest at \n2.5\n% (the “\n2.5\n% Notes”) was designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain Euro-functional currency subsidiaries. In March 2022, we redeemed the \n2.5\n% Notes and terminated the related hedging relationship. The currency translation adjustment amounts associated with the net investment hedge of the \n2.5\n% Notes will remain in accumulated OCI until realized upon a full or partial sale or liquidation of applicable Euro-functional currency subsidiaries.\nIn March 2022, we entered into \ntwo\n fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps (the “swaps”) with an aggregate notional amount of €\n300\n million. During the term of each contract, we receive interest payments in U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of \n5\n% and make interest payments in Euros at an average fixed rate of \n3.38\n% based on a notional amount and fixed interest rates determined at contract inception. The swaps were designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries. Hedge effectiveness is assessed each quarter based on the net investment in the foreign subsidiaries designated as the hedged item and the changes in the fair value of the designated interest rate swaps based on spot rates. For hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, changes in fair value are recorded as accumulated OCI within the foreign currency translation adjustment. Amounts excluded from hedge effectiveness at inception are recognized as interest accrues within interest expense. The maturity date of both swaps is February 2026, whereby, we will receive U.S. dollars from and pay Euros to the contract counterparties.\n \nForeign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses\nCertain of our operations outside of the United States use the related local currency as their functional currency. We translate revenue and expense at average rates of exchange during the period. We translate assets and liabilities at the rates of exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and include foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of accumulated OCI. Due to the nature of our operations and our corporate structure, we also have subsidiaries that have significant transactions in foreign currencies other than their functional currency. We record transaction gains and losses in our consolidated statements of operations related to the recurring remeasurement and settlement of such transactions.\nTo the extent practicable, we attempt to minimize this exposure by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities of similarly denominated foreign currencies. Additionally, as discussed above, we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities.\nF- 15\nTable of Contents\nDebt Issuance Costs\nWe defer costs we incur to issue debt, which are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, and amortize these costs to interest expense over the term of the debt or in circumstances where the debt can be redeemed at the option of the holders, over the term of the redemption option.\n \nMarketing Promotions\nWe periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services. Generally, our incentive offers are as follows:\nCurrent Discount Offers.\n These promotions include dollar or percent off discounts to be applied against current purchases. We record the discounts as reduction in revenue at the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction.\nInducement Offers.\n These promotions include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase. We treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We allocate the discount amount at the time of the offer between the current performance obligation and the potential future performance obligations based on our expected relative value of the transactions. We estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers.\nConcession Offers.\n These promotions include discounts to be applied against a future purchase to maintain customer satisfaction. Upon issuance, we record these concession offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for concession offers.\nAdvertising Expense\nWe incur advertising expense consisting of offline costs, including television and print advertising, and online advertising expense to promote our brands. We expense the production costs associated with advertisements in the period in which the advertisement first takes place. We expense the costs of communicating the advertisement (e.g., television airtime) as incurred each time the advertisement is shown.\n For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our advertising expense was $\n4.0\n billion, $\n3.8\n billion and $\n3.9\n billion. \nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and amortize the fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options as follows:\nRestricted Stock Units.\n RSUs are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests, typically over a \nfour-year\n period, but may accelerate in certain circumstances. We measure the value of RSUs at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. We amortize the fair value, net of actual forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term generally on a straight-line basis, but at least equal to the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. In addition, we have a limited number of market-based stock units and\n \nperformance-based stock units (collectively referred to as \"PSUs\"). For market-based awards, we calculated the fair value using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For performance-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value to be the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. The fair value, net of actual forfeitures, is amortized as stock-based compensation over the vesting term, generally a \ntwo\n or \nthree year\n period, on an accelerated basis. The number of shares that ultimately vest depends on achieving certain performance metrics or performance goals, as applicable, by the end of the performance period, assuming there is no accelerated vesting for, among other things, a termination of employment under certain circumstances. We record RSUs that may be settled by the holder in cash, rather than shares, as a liability and we remeasure these instruments at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Upon settlement of these awards, our total compensation expense recorded over the vesting period of the awards will equal the settlement amount, which is based on our stock price on the settlement date.\nStock Options.\n Our employee stock options consist of service based awards. We measure the value of stock options issued or modified, including unvested options assumed in acquisitions, on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, including the Black-Scholes. We amortize the fair value, net of actual forfeitures, over the remaining explicit vesting term in the case of service-based awards and the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period for awards with market conditions on a straight-line basis. In addition, we classify certain employee option awards as liabilities when we deem it not probable that the employees holding the awards will bear the risk and rewards of stock ownership for a reasonable period of time. Such options are revalued at the end of each reporting period and upon settlement our total compensation expense recorded from grant date to settlement date will equal the settlement amount. All outstanding options are fully vested as of December 31, 2024.\nF- 16\nTable of Contents\nEstimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value.\n \nEarnings Per Share\nWe compute basic earnings per share by taking net income or loss attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common and Class B common shares outstanding during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow. Diluted earnings per share include the potential dilution that could occur from stock-based awards and other stock-based commitments (which includes our Convertible Notes) using the treasury stock or the if converted method, as applicable. For additional information on how we compute earnings per share, see NOTE 12 — Earnings Per Share.\nFair Value Recognition, Measurement and Disclosure\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value as we maintain them with various high-quality financial institutions. The accounts receivable are short-term in nature and are generally settled shortly after the sale.\nWe disclose the fair value of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy using the following three categories:\nLevel 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers, primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third-party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and payment related fraud. We also rely on global distribution system partners and third-party service providers for certain fulfillment services\n.\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. We maintain some cash and cash equivalents balances with financial institutions that are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily composed of term deposits as well as bank (both interest and non-interest bearing) account balances denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollar, Euros, British pound, Indian Rupee, Brazilian real, South Korean Won, Australian dollar and Japanese Yen.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe have a number of regulatory and legal matters outstanding, as discussed further in NOTE 15 — Commitments and Contingencies. Periodically, we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess the potential financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. We base accruals made on the best information available at the time which can be highly subjective. The final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOccupancy and Other Taxes\nSome states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax, and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. Generally, hotels collect taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. When a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. We calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the \nF- 17\nTable of Contents\nrental of the room by the consumer. In most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit such taxes. A limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against certain of our companies for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on our services. We are an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting a vacation property and we believe is similarly not liable for such taxes. We are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. Some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. The ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. We have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes when determined to be probable and estimable. See NOTE 15 — Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Policies\nAs of January 1, 2024, we adopted the new guidance related to the disclosure and presentation requirements of reportable segments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") and included within each reported measure of segment profit and loss. In addition, the new guidance enhances interim disclosure requirements, clarifies circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contains other disclosure requirements. See NOTE 17 — Segment Information for the added disclosures.\nRecent Accounting Policies Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued new guidance to improve its income tax disclosure requirements. Under the new guidance, public business entities must annually (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate). The new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We will incorporate the new guidance in our tax disclosures in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued new guidance expanding disclosure requirements related to certain income statement expenses. The guidance requires tabular footnote disclosure of certain operating expenses disaggregated into categories, such as  employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization, included within each interim and annual income statement’s expense caption, as applicable. The effective date is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nF- 18\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 3 — \nFair Value Measurements \nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 are classified using the fair value hierarchy in the table below:\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\n \n(In millions)\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds\n$\n113\n \n$\n113\n \n$\n—\n \nTerm deposits and certificates of deposit\n163\n \n—\n \n163\n \nCommercial paper\n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \nDerivatives:\nCross-currency interest rate swaps\n25\n \n—\n \n25\n \nInvestments:\nEquity investments\n895\n \n895\n \n—\n \nCorporate debt securities\n354\n \n—\n \n354\n \nU.S. treasury securities\n70\n \n—\n \n70\n \nAsset-backed securities\n62\n \n—\n \n62\n \nTerm deposits and certificates of deposit\n3\n \n—\n \n3\n \nU.S. agency securities\n8\n \n—\n \n8\n \nNon-U.S. government securities\n3\n \n—\n \n3\n \nCommercial paper\n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \nTotal assets\n$\n1,700\n \n$\n1,008\n \n$\n692\n \nLiabilities\nDerivatives:\nForeign currency forward contracts\n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \nFinancial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 are classified using the fair value hierarchy in the table below:\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\n \n(In millions)\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds\n$\n168\n \n$\n168\n \n$\n—\n \nTerm deposits\n71\n \n—\n \n71\n \nDerivatives:\nCross-currency interest rate swaps\n8\n \n—\n \n8\n \nInvestments:\nTerm deposits\n28\n \n—\n \n28\n \nEquity investments\n584\n \n584\n \n—\n \nTotal assets\n$\n859\n \n$\n752\n \n$\n107\n \nLiabilities\nDerivatives:\nForeign currency forward contracts\n$\n9\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n9\n \nWe classify our cash equivalents and investments within Level 1 and Level 2 as we value our cash equivalents and investments using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. Valuation of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on foreign currency exchange rates in active markets, a Level 2 input. Valuation of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is based on foreign currency exchange rates and the current interest rate curve, Level 2 inputs.\nWe hold term deposit investments with financial institutions. Term deposits with original maturities of less than three \nF- 19\nTable of Contents\nmonths are classified as cash equivalents. Those with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments and those with remaining maturities of greater than one year are classified within long-term investments and other assets.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of term deposits, certificates of deposits, and money market funds with maturities of three months or less and bank account balances.\nWe primarily invest in investment grade corporate debt securities, U.S. treasury securities, and asset-backed securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. As of December 31, 2024, we had $\n300\n million of short-term and $\n202\n million of long-term available-for-sale investments, which generally mature within \nfour years\n. The amortized cost basis of the investments approximated their fair value with gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of less than $\n1\n million. We review our debt securities on a regular basis for impairment. During 2024, we did not recognize an allowance for credit-related losses on any of our investments. \nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. As of December 31, 2024, we were party to outstanding forward contracts hedging our liability exposures with a total net notional value of $\n3.9\n billion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had net forward liability of $\n2\n million ($\n42\n million gross forward liability) and $\n9\n million ($\n28\n million gross forward liability) recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We recorded $\n33\n million, $\n24\n million and $\n66\n million in net losses from foreign currency forward contracts in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nOn March 2, 2022, we entered into \ntwo\n fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of €\n300\n million, and maturity dates of February 2026. The swaps were designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets with the objective to protect the U.S. dollar value of our net investments in the Euro foreign operations due to movements in foreign currency. The fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps was an $\n25\n million asset as of December 31, 2024 and a $\n8\n million asset as of December 31, 2023, recorded in long-term investments and other assets. The gain recognized in interest expense was $\n5\n million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nOur equity investments include our marketable equity investment in Despegar, a publicly traded company, which is included in long-term investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $\n94\n million, $\n42\n million and $(\n45\n) million, respectively, within other, net in our consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value changes of this equity investments. \nIn connection with our disposition of Egencia (our former corporate travel arm) in 2021, we became an indirect holder of minority interest in GBT JerseyCo Ltd. (“GBT”), doing business as American Express Global Business Travel, and entered into a 10-year lodging supply agreement. In May 2022, GBT completed a deSPAC business combination with Apollo Strategic Growth Capital. This combination resulted in a newly publicly traded company, Global Business Travel Group, Inc. (“GBTG”), which together with GBT’s pre-combination shareholders owned all of GBT. Post combination, we had minority ownership interest in GBT and a commensurate voting interest in GBTG. In July 2023, GBTG simplified its organizational structure, and we exchanged our previously held GBT shares for an equal number of GBTG shares with no change to our ownership interest. Our previous GBT shares were exchangeable on a 1:1 basis for GBTG shares, and as such, we valued our investment based on the GBTG’s share price. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have an approximately \n16\n% ownership interest in GBTG. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $\n217\n million, $(\n26\n) million and $(\n300\n) million within other, net in our consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value changes of this equity investment. \nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis\nOur non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized or the underlying investment is sold. Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs. We measure our minority investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes with changes recorded within other, net on our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill. \nDuring 2023, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $\n297\n million related to our trivago segment. This impairment charge resulted from trivago’s strategic shift which included intensifying its brand marketing investments with an anticipated decrease in profitability. As a result, we concluded that sufficient indicators existed that to require us to perform an interim quantitative assessment of goodwill for our trivago segment as of September 30, 2023, in which we compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The fair value estimate for the reporting unit was based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market value approach, Level 3 inputs. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flows model included our weighted average cost of capital, projected cash flows and the long-term rate of growth. Our assumptions were based on the actual historical performance of the reporting unit and considered the weakening of \nF- 20\nTable of Contents\noperating results, and implied risk premiums based on market prices of our equity and debt as of the assessment date. Our significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and earnings multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. The excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over our estimate of the fair value was recorded as the goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2023, our trivago segment had no goodwill remaining.\nIntangible Assets.\n During 2024, we recognized \nintangible asset impairment charges\n of $\n147\n million related to indefinite-lived trade names, of which $\n114\n million related to our B2C segment and $\n33\n million related to our trivago segment. The B2C indefinite-lived trade name impairment charges were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2024 as part of our annual impairment test and resulted from changes in estimated future revenues of one of our B2C brands. The trivago indefinite-lived trade name impairment charge was recognized during the third quarter of 2024 and resulted from a decline in trivago revenue in the current year as well as trivago’s share price decline, which reduced its total market capitalization relative to its net assets. These indefinite-lived trade name assets were classified as Level 3 measurements and valued using the relief-from-royalty method, which included unobservable inputs, including projected revenues, weighted average cost of capital and royalty rates. The royalty rates for our impairments in 2024 ranged from \n2.5\n% to \n4\n%.\nDuring 2023, we recognized \nintangible asset impairment charges\n of $\n129\n million related to indefinite-lived trade names that resulted from changes in estimated future revenues of the related brands, of which $\n114\n million related to our B2C segment and $\n15\n million related to our trivago segment. The royalty rates for our impairments ranged from \n3\n% to \n4\n%. During 2022, we recognized intangible impairment charges of $\n81\n million related to an indefinite-lived trade name within our trivago segment that resulted from changes in the weighted average cost of capital. \nMinority Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Values. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying values of our minority investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $\n293\n million and $\n330\n million. During 2024, we sold a minority investment for $\n15\n million and recognized an \nimmaterial\n gain on the transaction. In addition, during 2024, we recorded $\n22\n million of losses related to a minority investment, resulting from a valuation using an option pricing model that utilizes judgmental inputs such as discounts for lack of marketability and estimated exit event timing. During 2023 and 2022, we had \nno\n material gains or losses recognized related to these minority investments. As of December 31, 2024, total cumulative adjustments made to the initial cost basis of these investments included $\n127\n million in unrealized downward adjustments (including impairments).\nNOTE 4 — \nProperty and Equipment, Net\nOur property and equipment consists of the following:\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nCapitalized software development\n$\n3,373\n \n$\n3,290\n \nComputer equipment\n170\n \n202\n \nFurniture and other equipment\n115\n \n113\n \nBuildings and leasehold improvements\n1,227\n \n1,222\n \nLand\n146\n \n146\n \n5,031\n \n4,973\n \nLess: accumulated depreciation\n(\n2,814\n)\n(\n2,765\n)\nProjects in progress\n196\n \n151\n \nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n2,413\n \n$\n2,359\n \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our recorded capitalized software development costs, net of accumulated amortization, which have been placed in service were $\n1.1\n billion and $\n999\n million.

Accrued interest related to the Senior Notes was $\n73\n million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nConvertible Notes Outstanding. \nThe net carrying amount of the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n996\n million and $\n993\n million, respectively, which reflects the $\n1\n billion in principal less unamortized debt issuance costs of $\n4\n million and $\n7\n million, respectively. Interest expense related to the amortization of the debt issuance costs for the Convertible Notes was $\n3\n million during both of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nThe Convertible Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with each other and with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, including our existing senior notes. The Convertible Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the subsidiary guarantors, which include each domestic subsidiary that is a borrower under or guarantees the obligations under our existing senior secured credit agreement. So long as the guarantees are in effect, each subsidiary guarantor’s guarantee will be the unsecured, unsubordinated obligation of such subsidiary guarantor and will rank equally in right of payment with each other and with all of such subsidiary guarantor’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, including such subsidiary guarantor’s guarantees of our existing senior notes.\nThe Convertible Notes will mature on February 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The Convertible Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Convertible Notes will not accrete. \nThe Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 3.9212 shares of common stock of Expedia Group with a par value $\n0.0001\n per share (referred to as “our common stock” herein), per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $\n255.02\n per share of our common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to, the issuance of stock \nF- 25\nTable of Contents\ndividends and payment of cash dividends. At any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 15, 2025, holders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option only under the following circumstances:\n•      during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least \n20\n trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of \n30\n consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is equal to or greater than \n130\n% of the conversion price then in effect on each applicable trading day;\n•      during the \nfive\n business day period immediately after any \nfive\n consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than \n98\n% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\n•     if the Company calls any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the redemption date, but only with respect to the Convertible Notes called for redemption (or deemed called for redemption); or\n•     upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nIrrespective of the foregoing conditions, holders may convert their Convertible Notes on or after November 15, 2025 and prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a corporate event that constitutes a “make-whole fundamental change” per the indenture, or if we call the Convertible Notes for redemption, and a holder elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or during the related redemption period, as the case may be, such holder may be entitled to an increase in the conversion rate in certain circumstances as described in the indenture. Upon conversion, holders will receive cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.\nPrior to the 41st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock has been at least \n130\n% of the conversion price then in effect for at least \n20\n trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any \n30\n consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, we may redeem for cash all or part of the Convertible Notes at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, except as otherwise described in the indenture.\nEstimated Fair Value.\n The total estimated fair value of our Senior Notes was approximately $\n5.1\n billion as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. Additionally, the estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes was $\n997\n million and $\n953\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The fair value was determined based on quoted market prices in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nRedemption of Senior Notes\nDuring 2022, we early redeemed all of our €\n650\n million registered senior unsecured notes that were due June 2022 and bore interest at \n2.5\n% (the “\n2.5\n% Notes”), all of our $\n500\n million registered senior unsecured notes that were due December 2023 and bore interest at \n3.6\n% (the “\n3.6\n% Notes”), and all of our $\n500\n million registered senior unsecured notes that were due August 2024 and bore interest at \n4.5\n% (the “\n4.5\n% Notes”), which resulted in the recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment of $\n24\n million during the year ended December 31, 2022. This loss primarily reflected the payment of \"make-whole\" premiums of $\n20\n million for the \n3.6\n% and \n4.5\n% Notes as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts of $\n4\n million. \nIn addition, during 2022, we settled a tender offer to purchase $\n500\n million in aggregate principal of our \n2.95\n% Senior Notes due 2031 (the “\n2.95\n% Notes”) for an aggregate cash repurchase price of approximately $\n418\n million, which resulted in the recognition of a net gain on debt extinguishment of $\n73\n million. The net gain included the write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts of $\n8\n million as well as fees of $\n1\n million.\nCredit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Expedia Group maintained a $\n2.5\n billion revolving credit facility that matures in April 2027. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had \nno\n revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding. Loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an index rate plus a margin (a) in the case of term benchmark loans, ranging from \n1.00\n% to \n1.75\n% per annum, depending on Expedia Group's credit ratings, and (b) in the case of base rate loans, ranging from \n0.00\n% to \n0.75\n% per annum, depending on Expedia Group's credit ratings. A fee is payable quarterly in respect of undrawn commitments under the revolving credit facility at a rate ranging from \n0.10\n% to \n0.25\n% per annum, depending on \nF- 26\nTable of Contents\nExpedia Group's credit ratings. The terms of the revolving credit facility require Expedia Group to not exceed a specified maximum consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter. \nThe revolving credit facility has a $\n120\n million letter of credit (“LOC”) sublimit, and the amount of LOCs issued under the facility reduced the credit amount available. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was $\n45\n million and $\n40\n million of outstanding stand-by LOCs issued under the facility.\nNOTE 8 — \nEmployee Benefit Plans\nOur U.S. employees are generally eligible to participate in a retirement and savings plan that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating employees may contribute up to \n50\n% of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax and/or Roth basis. Employees may also contribute up to \n10\n% after-tax, not to exceed \n60\n% of pay and not more than statutory limits. Expedia Group makes matching contributions in an amount equal to \n50\n% of participant 401(k) contributions up to the first \n6\n% of their compensation each payroll period. Our contribution vests with the employee after the employee completes \ntwo years\n of service. Participating employees have the option to invest in our common stock, but there is no requirement for participating employees to invest their contribution or our matching contribution in our common stock. We also have various defined contribution plans for our international employees. Our contributions to these benefit plans were $\n69\n million, $\n72\n million and $\n63\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nNOTE 9 — \nStock-Based Awards and Other Equity Instruments \nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Expedia Group, Inc. 2005 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan, we may grant restricted stock, restricted stock awards, RSUs, stock options and other stock-based awards, such as PSUs, to directors, officers, employees and consultants. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately \nnine\n million shares of common stock reserved for new stock-based awards under the 2005 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan.

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $\n33\n million, $\n9\n million and $\n89\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nThere were \nno\n options granted during 2024, 2023 or 2022. \nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized total stock-based compensation expense of $\n458\n million, $\n413\n million and $\n374\n million. The total income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $\n152\n million, $\n88\n million and $\n106\n million for 2024, 2023 and 2022. We capitalized $\n81\n million, $\n71\n million and $\n54\n million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the cost of developing internal-use software in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nCash received from stock-based award exercises for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n67\n million, $\n60\n million and $\n98\n million, respectively. Total current income tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 associated with the exercise of stock-based awards held by our employees were $\n24\n million, $\n17\n million and $\n17\n million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there was approximately $\n795\n million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based awards, which is expected to be recognized in expense over a weighted-average period of \n1.38\n years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which allows shares of our common stock to be purchased by eligible employees at three-month intervals at \n85\n% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. Eligible employees were allowed to contribute up to \n15\n% of their base compensation. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately \n415,000\n, \n442,000\n, and \n305,000\n shares were purchased under this plan for an average price of $\n116.91\n, $\n92.56\n and $\n109.36\n per share.

State NOLs of $\n68\n million may be carried forward indefinitely, and state NOLs of $\n161\n million expire at various times starting from 2025. Foreign NOLs of $\n175\n million may be carried forward indefinitely, and foreign NOLs of $\n97\n million expire at various times starting from 2026. As of December 31, 2024, we had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $\n103\n million, which expire at various times starting from 2038.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $\n176\n million related to capital loss carryforwards and unrealized losses on minority investments for which it is more likely than not the tax benefits will not be realized. The valuation allowance decreased by $\n68\n million from the amount recorded as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the unrealized losses on minority investments. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable may be adjusted if capital gains are realized or if, in certain jurisdictions, objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative GAAP losses is no longer applicable and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. \nMost of our foreign undistributed earnings have already been subject to U.S. federal income tax.

As of December 31, 2023, we had $\n425\n million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $\n223\n million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2022, we had $\n379\n million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $\n213\n million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.  \nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties of $\n117\n million and $\n90\n million were reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nThe Company is routinely audited by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities. These audits include questioning the timing and amount of income and deductions, and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. The IRS is currently examining Expedia Group’s U.S. consolidated federal income tax returns for the periods ended December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2020. The Company has consented to an extension of the statute of \nF- 31\nTable of Contents\nlimitations, until June 30, 2026 for the 2011 through 2020 tax years. As of December 31, 2024, for the Expedia Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries group, statutes of limitations for tax years 2011 through 2023 remain open to examination in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and most state jurisdictions. For the HomeAway and Orbitz groups, statutes of limitations for tax years 2007 through 2015 remain open to examination in the U.S. federal and most state jurisdictions due to NOL carryforwards.\nFor tax years 2011 to 2013 and 2014 to 2016, the IRS issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The 2011 to 2013 adjustments would result in federal income tax of approximately $\n244\n million, subject to interest. The 2014 to 2016 adjustments would result in federal income tax of approximately $\n431\n million, subject to interest. We do not agree with these adjustments and will continue to vigorously defend our position through administrative procedures. We are also under examination by the IRS for our 2017 to 2020 tax years. \nOn December 20, 2011, we completed a spin-off of TripAdvisor into a separate publicly-traded corporation. Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement between Expedia Group and TripAdvisor, TripAdvisor is responsible for its potential income tax liabilities in connection with any consolidated income tax returns filed as a part of Expedia Group’s consolidated income tax return prior to or in connection with the spin-off. TripAdvisor is required to indemnify Expedia Group for any such taxes, including interest, penalties, legal, and professional fees.  \nIn 2023, TripAdvisor agreed in principle with the IRS to an assessed amount of $\n120\n million, inclusive of interest and state tax effects, for transfer pricing adjustments with its foreign subsidiaries for the 2009 to 2011 tax years. The assessment is a tax liability for tax years when TripAdvisor was part of Expedia Group's consolidated income tax return and is covered by the indemnification pursuant to the tax sharing agreement. In May 2023, Expedia Group received from the IRS the final assessment for the 2009 through 2011 tax years related to the TripAdvisor matter. Expedia Group remitted $\n113\n million in settlement payments to the IRS, as the primary obligor for this assessment, and received the reimbursement required from TripAdvisor in settlement of the indemnification receivable for this matter. During 2023, we recorded $\n67\n million of additional income tax expense and a corresponding tax indemnification adjustment in other, net in our consolidated statements of operations representing the estimate of the incremental assessed payment to the IRS, including state tax effects. During 2024, we recorded an additional $\n6\n million of income tax expense related to interest adjustments for the 2010-2011 tax years.\nNOTE 11 — \nCapital Stock \nCommon Stock and Class B Common Stock\nOur authorized common stock consists of \n1.6\n billion shares of common stock with par value of $\n0.0001\n per share, and \n400\n million shares of Class B common stock with par value of $\n0.0001\n per share.

Common stock is entitled to \n1\n vote per share and Class B common stock is entitled to \n10\n votes per share. Holders of common stock, voting as a single, separate class are entitled to elect \n25\n% of the total number of directors. Class B common stockholders may, at any time, convert their shares into common stock, on a \none\n for one share basis. Upon conversion, the Class B common stock is retired and is not available for reissue. In the event of liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up of Expedia Group, Inc., the holders of both classes of common stock have equal rights to receive all the assets of Expedia Group, Inc. after the rights of the holders of the preferred stock, if any, have been satisfied.\nTreasury Stock \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's treasury stock was comprised of approximately \n164.2\n million shares of common stock and \n7.3\n million Class B shares. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's treasury stock was comprised of approximately \n150.6\n million shares of common stock and \n7.3\n million Class B shares. \nShare Repurchases. \nIn 2018 and 2019, the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee of the Board, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Board, authorized a program to repurchase up to \n15\n million shares and \n20\n million shares of our common stock (the “2018 Share Repurchase Program” and the “2019 Share Repurchase Program”). In October 2023, the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the Board, authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $\n5\n billion of our common stock (“2023 Share Repurchase Program”). The 2018 and 2019 Share Repurchase Programs have been completed. Our 2023\n \nShare Repurchase Program does not have fixed expiration dates and does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be subject to the discretion of the Company and depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of Expedia Group’s common stock, general market and economic conditions, regulatory requirements and other business considerations. \nF- 32\nTable of Contents\nShares repurchased under the authorized programs were as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumber of shares repurchased\n12.1\n million\n19.1\n million\n5.2\n million\nAverage price per share\n$\n133.85\n \n$\n106.07\n \n$\n96.09\n \nTotal cost of repurchases (in millions)\n(1)\n$\n1,616\n \n$\n2,031\n \n$\n500\n \n___________________________________\n(1)\nAmount excludes transaction costs and the excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n3.2\n billion remains authorized for repurchase with no fixed termination date for the repurchases. \nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe balance of accumulated OCI as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments. These translation adjustments include foreign currency transaction gains at December 31, 2024 and 2023 of $\n19\n million ($\n25\n million before tax) and $\n6\n million ($\n8\n million before tax) associated with our cross-currency interest rate swaps. Additionally, translation adjustments include foreign currency transaction losses of $\n7\n million ($\n10\n million before tax) as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023 associated with previously settled Euro-denominated notes that were designated as net investment hedges. See NOTE 2 — Significant Accounting Policies for more information.\nNon-redeemable Non-controlling Interests\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our ownership interest in trivago was approximately \n59.5\n% and \n60.0\n%. \nDuring 2023, trivago paid a one-time extraordinary dividend totaling approximately EUR \n184\n million (or approximately EUR \n0.53\n per share), which included intercompany payments to Expedia Group as well as $\n78\n million to third-parties included in other, net in financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nNOTE 12 — \nEarnings Per Share \nBasic Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share was calculated for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 using the weighted average number of common and Class B common shares outstanding during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we computed diluted earnings per share using (i) the number of shares of common stock and Class B common stock used in the basic earnings per share calculation as indicated above, (ii) if dilutive, the incremental common stock that we would issue upon the assumed exercise or vesting of stock-based awards and common stock warrants using the treasury stock method, (iii) if dilutive, our Convertible Notes using the if-converted method, and (iv) other stock-based commitments.\nF- 33\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents our basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share:\n \nYear Ended December 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions, except share and per share data)\nNet income attributable to Expedia Group, Inc.\n$\n1,234\n \n$\n797\n \n$\n352\n \nEarnings (loss) per share attributable to Expedia Group, Inc. available to common stockholders: \nBasic\n$\n9.39\n \n$\n5.50\n \n$\n2.24\n \nDiluted\n8.95\n \n5.31\n \n2.17\n \nWeighted average number of shares outstanding (000's):\nBasic\n131,432\n \n144,967\n \n156,672\n \nDilutive effect of:\nConvertible Notes\n3,921\n \n3,921\n \n3,921\n \nStock-based awards\n2,566\n \n1,340\n \n1,158\n \nDiluted\n137,919\n \n150,228\n \n161,751\n \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately \n1\n million, approximately \n4\n million and approximately \n9\n million of outstanding stock-based awards have been excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nThe earnings per share amounts are the same for common stock and Class B common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.\nNOTE 13 — \nRestructuring and Related Reorganization Charges \nIn February 2024, we committed to restructuring actions to recalibrate resources as most of the Company’s organizational and technological transformation is now completed, which have resulted in headcount reductions. As a result, we recognized $\n80\n million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during 2024. The charges were predominately related to employee severance, stock-based compensation and benefit costs and approximately $\n10\n million was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. Based on current plans which are subject to change, we expect reorganization charges could continue under our previously announced $\n80\n million to $\n100\n million plan into 2025. These costs could be higher or lower should we make additional decisions in future periods that impact our reorganization efforts.\n \nNOTE 14 — \nOther Income (Expense)\nOther, net\nThe following table presents the components of other, net:\n \nFor the Year Ended December 31, \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nForeign exchange rate losses, net\n$\n(\n66\n)\n$\n(\n85\n)\n$\n(\n40\n)\nGains (losses) on minority equity investments, net\n289\n \n16\n \n(\n345\n)\nTripAdvisor tax indemnification adjustment\n6\n \n67\n \n—\n \nGain on sale of businesses and investments, net\n5\n \n25\n \n6\n \nTotal\n$\n234\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n(\n379\n)\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had no business dispositions, but we recognized miscellaneous gains related to sales of businesses in a prior year as well as a immaterial gain on the sale of a cost method investment during 2024.\n \nF- 34\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 15 — \nCommitments and Contingencies \nLetters of Credit, Purchase Obligations and Guarantees\nWe have commitments and obligations that include purchase obligations, guarantees and LOCs, which could potentially require our payment in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events. \nThe following table presents these commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2024:\n \n \nBy Period\n \nTotal\nLess than\n1  year\n1 to 3\nyears\n3 to 5\nyears\nMore than\n5  years\n \n(In millions)\nPurchase obligations\n$\n495\n \n$\n252\n \n$\n228\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n—\n \nGuarantees\n36\n \n29\n \n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \nLetters of credit\n50\n \n44\n \n6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n$\n581\n \n$\n325\n \n$\n241\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n—\n \nOur purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors. These minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods. Payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use.  \nWe have guarantees which consist primarily of bonds relating to tax assessments that we are contesting as well as bonds required by certain foreign countries’ aviation authorities for the potential non-delivery, by us, of packaged travel sold in those countries. The authorities also require that a portion of the total amount of packaged travel sold be bonded. Our guarantees also include certain surety bonds related to various company performance obligations. \nOur LOCs consist of stand-by LOCs, underwritten by a group of lenders, which we primarily issue for certain regulatory purposes as well as to certain hotel properties to secure our payment for hotel room transactions. The contractual expiration dates of these LOCs are shown in the table above. There were no material claims made against any stand-by LOCs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various lawsuits. Management does not expect these lawsuits to have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of Expedia Group. We also evaluate other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax, excise tax, sales tax, transient occupancy or accommodation tax and similar matters. We do not believe that the aggregate amount of liability that could be reasonably possible with respect to these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial results; however, litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual losses incurred in the event that our legal proceedings were to result in unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nLitigation Relating to Occupancy Taxes.\n \nOne hundred three\n lawsuits have been filed by or against cities, counties and states involving hotel occupancy and other taxes. \nTwo\n lawsuits are currently active. These lawsuits are in various stages and we continue to defend against the claims made in them vigorously. With respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. We believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations. To date, \nforty-nine\n of these lawsuits have been dismissed. Some of these dismissals have been without prejudice and, generally, allow the governmental entity or entities to seek administrative remedies prior to pursuing further litigation. \nThirty-four\n dismissals were based on a finding that we and the other defendants were not subject to the local tax ordinance or that the local government lacked standing to pursue its claims. As a result of this litigation and other attempts by certain jurisdictions to levy such taxes, we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $\n3\n million and $\n46\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The reserve balance decreased $\n43\n million as of December 31, 2024 due to the favorable resolution of two cases during the year. Our settlement reserve is based on our best estimate of probable losses and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. An estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made. Changes to the settlement reserve are included within legal reserves, occupancy tax and other in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPay-to-Play.\n Certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are \nF- 35\nTable of Contents\nmade, we continue to defend our position vigorously. If we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.\n \nWe are in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities, some of which may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court.\nMatters Relating to International VAT\n.  We are in various stages of inquiry or audit in multiple European Union jurisdictions regarding the application of VAT to our European Union related transactions. While we believe we comply with applicable VAT laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes. \nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we entered into discussions with Italian tax authorities to resolve matters raised in an audit of the 2016 to 2022 tax years regarding the Company’s purported Italian VAT obligations. In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a reserve for the potential settlement of these matters, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of facts and circumstances at that time, in the amount of $\n92\n million. While we continue to believe Expedia Group is compliant with Italian tax laws, on November 21, 2024, we reached an agreement with the Italian tax authorities and paid $\n71\n million for tax years 2016 to 2022. We are in ongoing discussions with the Italian tax authorities to resolve VAT claims related to subsequent years. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we increased the legal reserve by $\n15\n million. Our settlement reserve is based on our best estimate and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. Changes to this settlement reserve are included within legal reserves, occupancy tax and other in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and Italy, we may be required to “pay-to-play” any VAT assessment prior to contesting its validity. While we believe that we will be successful based on the merits of our positions with regard to audits in pay-to-play jurisdictions, it is nevertheless reasonably possible that we could be required to pay any assessed amounts in order to contest or litigate the applicability of any assessments and an estimate for a reasonably possible amount of any such payments cannot be made.\nCompetition and Consumer Matters\n. On August 23, 2018, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or \"ACCC\", instituted proceedings in the Australian Federal Court against trivago. The ACCC alleged breaches of Australian Consumer Law, or \"ACL,\" relating to trivago’s advertisements in Australia concerning the hotel prices available on trivago’s Australian site, trivago’s strike-through pricing practice and other aspects of the way offers for accommodation were displayed on trivago's Australian website. On January 20, 2020, the Australian Federal Court issued a judgment finding trivago had engaged in conduct in breach of the ACL. On October 18 and 19, 2021, the court heard submissions from the parties regarding penalties and other orders. On April 22, 2022, the Australian Federal Court issued a judgment ordering trivago to pay a penalty of AU$\n44.7\n million, which was paid in the second quarter of 2022, and to cover the ACCC’s costs arising from the proceedings. The court also enjoined trivago from engaging in misleading conduct of the type found by the Australian Federal Court to be in contravention of the ACL. We recorded an estimated loss of approximately $\n11\n million with respect to these proceedings in a previous period and an additional loss of approximately $\n23\n million during the first quarter of 2022, for a total of approximately $\n34\n million previously included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of March 31, 2022.\n \nNOTE 16 — \nRelated Party Transactions \nIAC Inc. \nThe Company and IAC are related parties because Mr. Diller serves as Chairman and Senior Executive of both Expedia Group and IAC.  At December 31, 2024, each of Expedia Group and IAC has a \n50\n% ownership interest in \ntwo\n aircraft that may be used by both companies. Members of the aircraft flight crews are employed by an entity in which the Company and IAC each have a \n50\n% ownership interest. The Company and IAC have agreed to share costs relating to flight crew compensation and benefits pro-rata according to each company’s respective usage of the aircraft, for which they are separately billed by the entity described above. We share equally in fixed and nonrecurring costs for the aircraft; direct operating costs are pro-rated based on actual usage. Another aircraft that had previously been jointly-owned by the companies was sold in November 2022, with each company receiving \n50\n% of the $\n19\n million in net sale proceeds. \nIn addition, we have agreements pursuant to which we may use additional aircraft owned by a subsidiary of IAC on a cost basis. Total payments made to this entity by the Company were not material.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net basis in our ownership interest in the aircrafts then jointly-owned was $\n40\n million\n \nand $\n43\n million, respectively, recorded in long-term investments and other assets. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, operating and maintenance costs paid directly to the jointly-owned subsidiary for the aircraft were not material.\nF- 36\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 17 — \nSegment Information \nWe have the following reportable segments: B2C, B2B, and trivago. Our B2C segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including: Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif Group, ebookers, CheapTickets, Hotwire.com and CarRentals.com. Our B2B segment fuels a wide range of travel and non-travel companies including airlines, offline travel agents, online retailers, corporate travel management and financial institutions, who leverage our leading travel technology and tap into our diverse supply to augment their offerings and market Expedia Group rates and availabilities to their travelers. Our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites. \nOur chief operating decision makers (\"CODMs\") are our Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman.\n \nWe determined our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance. Our primary operating metric is Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our B2C and B2B segments includes allocations of certain expenses, primarily related to our global travel supply organization and the majority of costs from our product and technology platform, as well as facility costs and the realized foreign currency gains or losses related to the forward contracts hedging a component of our net merchant lodging revenue. We base the allocations primarily on transaction volumes and other usage metrics. We do not allocate certain shared expenses such as accounting, human resources, certain information technology and legal to our reportable segments. We include these expenses in Corporate and Eliminations. Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change. \nOur CODMs use Adjusted EBITDA to allocate resources for each segment predominantly in the annual budget and forecasting process. The CODMs consider budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis using Adjusted EBITDA when making decisions about allocating capital and personnel to the segments. The CODMs also use Adjusted EBITDA to assess the performance for each segment and in the compensation of certain employees.\nOur segment disclosure includes intersegment revenues, which primarily consist of advertising and media services provided by our trivago segment to our B2C segment. These intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at amounts that approximate fair value as if the transactions were between third parties, and therefore, impact segment performance. However, the revenue and corresponding expense are eliminated in consolidation. The elimination of such intersegment transactions is included within Corporate and Eliminations in the table below. \nCorporate and Eliminations also includes unallocated corporate functions and expenses. In addition, we record amortization of intangible assets and any related impairment, as well as stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and related reorganization charges, legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, and other items excluded from segment operating performance in Corporate and Eliminations.
