  "item1_summary": " Premiums wri wri were $3.15 billion in 2024 compared to underwriting loss of $2.09 billion in 2023, primarily due to increased premiums earned, favorable reserve reestimates and lower losses partially offset by higher advertising costs . The Allstate Corporation       41-10-K form 10-K .\n Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period . The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired term of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position . Premiums written by line of business are written to premiums earned .\n In 2024, rate increases of 10.4% were implemented in 55 locations, resulting in total insurance premium impact of 7.5% . PIF decreased 1.4%. Homeowners insurance premiums written increased 14.6% or $1.83 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 . Auto premiums written  increased 9.8%  or $3.34 billion  in 2024 .\n Policy growth is being driven primarily by the Allstate brand and is geographically widespread . Policy growth may be negatively impacted as we improve underwriting margins to targeted levels through underwriting and rate actions . We may not be able to grow in certain states without regulatory or legislative reforms that enable customers to be provided coverage at appropriate risk adjusted returns . e implemented in 53 locations, resulting in total insurance premium impact of 11.0%• Increased new issued applications in the exclusive agency and direct channels .\n Other business lines premiums written increased 15.0% or $85 million in 2024 compared to 2023 due to growth in the lender-placed business . Loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio to analyze our profitability trends . Other revenue is deducted from operating costs and expenses in the expense ratio calculation . Expense ratio includes other revenue of $223 million, $57 million, and $19 million for fees on involuntary auto policies .\n For the years ended December 31, the underwriting loss ratio by line of business was 72.7% . The underwriting losses are influenced by::Supply chain disruptions and labor shortages . The mix of repairable losses and total losses can impact the value of total losses due to changes in used car prices and medical inflation and consumption .\n Estimated report year 2024 incurred claim severity for Allstate increased compared to report year 2023 for major coverages due to higher repair costs, a higher mix of total losses, an increase in claims with attorney representation, higher medical consumption, and inflation . The quarterly auto loss ratio has been more variable due to these and additional factors discussed below .\n Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms and freezes, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes . We define a “catastrophe” as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million .\n The impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio in 2024 was 27.8 points compared to the average annual impact for the last ten years of 27.6 points . The Allstate Corporation may not be able to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts we consider sufficient at acceptable prices . We may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and to assessments from these facilities .\n As of December 31, 2024, Ivantage had $2.57 billion non-proprietary premiums under management . The insurer has decreased its overall homeowner exposure in California by more than 50% since 2007 .

Florida, respectively .\n In 2024, premiums written totaled $8.75 billion or 60.7% of homeowners premiums written . We consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to be major metropolitan centers along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States . The average premium on a property policy near these coasts is generally greater than in other areas .\n Allstate homeowner policyholders in California are offered coverage for damage caused by an earthquake through the California Earthquake Authority (“CEA”), a privately financed, publicly managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage . We purchase reinsurance in Kentucky and enter into arrangements in many states to make earthquake coverage available through our brokerage platform .\n Allstate is subject to assessments from the California FAIR Plan Association providing insurance for property losses . The total cost of our property catastrophe reinsurance programs, excluding reinstatement premiums, during 2024 was $1.11 billion compared to $1 .02 billion during 2023 . Expense ratio  increased 0.7 points in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in advertising costs, partially offset by higher earned premium growth .\n Underwriting expenses are underwriting expenses of $11,663 . DAC is amortized to income over the period in which premiums are earned . DAC balance as of December 31 by product type . DAC asset for costs that are related directly to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance policies, principally agent remuneration and premium taxes .\n The reserve reestimates in 2024 primarily related to new reported information for asbestos related claims and adverse developments within the other run-off lines . For additional information on our strategy and outlook, see Part I, Item 1. Business - Strategy and Segment Information . We believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws, regulations, and assessments of other pertinent factors .\n Reserves for asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims before and after the effects of reinsurance may be more variable . Reserves by type of exposure are based on exposure before, after and after reinsurance changes . Reservancies include asbestos claims, environmental claims and other runs-off business. Reserves include excess commercial insurance and reinsurance .\n In 2024 and 2023, 87% and 85% of payments related to settlement agreements, respectively, are expected to be substantially paid out over the next several years as qualified claims are submitted by these insureds .

Operating costs and expenses increased 22.6%   $201 million   from 2023 to 2024 . Underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of claims and claims expense reserves .\n The Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (“MCCA”) as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively . Includes $6.41 billion, $6.,36 billion and $6,66 billion of unpaid indemnification recoverables related to the MCCA . The reserve reestimates are shown in parentheses .\n The Allstate Corporation used property and casualty premiums earned.   using property . insurance premiums earned . Favorable reserve reestimates are shown in parentheses . The table below shows Allstate Protection net reserves representing the estimated cost of outstanding claims as they were recorded at the beginning of years 2024, 2023, and 2022 .\n Allstate Protection reserves includes a $944 million reclassification of reserves from homeowners to auto . Unfavorable reserve reestimates in 2023 totaled $461 million and represented 22.1% of the underwriting loss and were primarily due to National General personal auto lines, homeowners and commercial lines . Reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined .\n Reserves and claim activity before (Gross) and after (Net) the effects of reinsurance are determined . Reserves are based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g., claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, jurisdiction) presented by policyholders.  or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines reserves . In 2024, reserves will be based on new reported information for asbestos related claims and adverse developments within the other run-off lines .\n The survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year . This is a commonly used but simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels . Many factors such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and claims expense reserves .\n IBNR provides for reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current policyholders and ceding companies . We utilize reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage capital . We also participate in various indemnification mechanisms, including state-based pool or facility programs mandating participation by insurers offering certain coverage in their state and the federal government National Flood Insurance Program .\n All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation . We anticipate completing the placement of our 2025 nationwide catastrophe reinsurance program in the first half of 2025 .

The company's S&P financial strength rating is at risk .\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, MCCA includes $71 million and $62 million of reinsurance recoverable on paid claims, respectively . As our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded . Reinsurance and indemnification recoverables include an estimate of the amount of insurance claims and claims expense reserves that are ceded .\n The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to other reinsurance programs primarily related to our Run-off Property-Liability segment . The allowance was $63 million and $62 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 . The Allstate Corporation has not had any credit losses related to these programs .\n The reinsurance ceded and indemnification programs have a negative effect on premiums earned and claims and claims expense . The National Flood Insurance Program has been concentrated among fewer companies . In 2024, c. ustry to be concentrated with fewer companies. The reinsurers' losses are expected to be less than 50% of the reinsurance portfolio .\n In 2024, ceded claims and claims expenses increased $1.08 billion . In 2023,  ceded premiums earned increased primarily due to catastrophe reinsurance . Ceded claims expenses decreased $967 million in 2023 due to lower amounts related to NFIP . For further discussion of these items, see Regulation, Indemnification Programs and Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements .\n There are 63 claims with reserves in excess of $15 million as of December 31, 2024 . 90% of our 1,300 catastrophic claims that are eligible for reimbursement by the MCCA occurred more than 5 years ago and continue to incur costs . There is no contractual limitation on any policy effective July 1, 2020 or prior, and policies that selected the unlimited PIP benefits option on or after July 2, 2020 .\n In 2024, Allstate Health and Benefits represented 2.0% of total PIF . Our target customers are small group employers and consumers with family and financial protection needs . The individual health business will either be retained or divested . The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions .\n The Allstate Health and Benefits Department has a benefit ratio of 62.8% . The benefit ratio is calculated as accident, health and other policy benefits less interest credited to contractholder funds of $34 million, $33 million,  for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, divided by premiums and contract charges .\n New annualized premium sales (annualized premiums at initial employer voluntary benefit customer enrollment or health policy sale) were $732 million in 2024 and 2023 .Adjusted net income (receiving) decreased $56 million  in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased benefit utilization across all lines of business . Amortization of DAC (decreased) 2.7% or $4 million .\n The return on our investment portfolios is an important component of our ability to offer value to customers, fund business improvements and create value for shareholders . Investment portfolios are held for Property-Liability, Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits and Corporate and Other operations . Management of the underlying portfolios is significantly influenced by the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability profile .\n The Allstate Health and Benefits portfolio is focused on protection of principal and consistent income generation within a total return framework . Products with lower liquidity and capital needs, such as auto insurance and run-off lines, create capacity to invest in less liquid higher yielding fixed income securities, performance-based investments such as limited partnerships and equity securities . The Corporate and Other portfolio is primarily focused on liquidity needs and capital preservation .\n Performance-based strategy seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk . Returns are impacted by a variety of factors including general macroeconomic and public market conditions as public benchmarks are often used in the valuation of underlying investments . The portfolio is diversified across a number of characteristics, including managers or partners, vintage years, investment strategies, geographies and industry sectors .\n In 2024, we increased public equity securities by $2.05 billion primarily funded through the sale of investment grade corporate bonds and short-term investments . We utilize our integrated enterprise risk and return management framework to determine the amount of investment risk we are willing to accept . We extended the fixed income portfolio duration as the sustained higher market yields provided an opportunity to increase risk-adjusted returns .\n The fair value of equity securities held as of December 31, 2024 was $134 million in excess of cost . The net gains were primarily concentrated in the technology and banking sectors . The portfolio was increased by $2.05 billion in 2024 . The sustained higher market yields provided an opportunity to increase risk-adjusted returns, so extended the fixed income portfolio duration to 5.3 years .\n As of December 31, 2024, 91.3% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade . The Securities Valuation Office (“SVO”) of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) evaluates the fixed income . The rating is either received from the SVO based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations list .\n Market prices for certain securities may have credit spreads which imply higher or lower credit quality than the current third-party rating . Initial investment decisions and ongoing monitoring procedures for fixed income securities are based on a due diligence process . The process includes a quarterly review of all securities to identify instances where fair value of a security compared to its amortized cost is below internally established thresholds .\n The portfolio of $8.96 billion portfolio of privately placed securities, primarily 144A bonds, is diversified by issuer, industry sector and country . The portfolio is made up of 544 issuers . Privately placed corporate obligations may contain structural security features such as financial covenants and call protections that provide investors greater protection against credit deterioration, reinvestment risk .\n Our corporate bond portfolio includes $4.49 billion of below investment grade bonds, $3.88 billion of which are privately placed, primarily 144A bonds . Every issue not rated by an independent rating agency is internally rated with a formal rating affirmation at least once a year . Liquidity of securities issued by public entities in unregistered form is similar to public debt markets .\n Many of the securities in the ABS portfolio have credit enhancement with features such as overcollateralization, subordinated structures, reserve funds, guarantees or insurance . The underlying collateral may contain fixed interest rates, variable interest rates (such as adjustable-rate mortgages), or both fixed and variable rate features . Key considerations used to manage our exposure include property type and geographic diversification .\n We have commitments to invest additional amounts in limited partnership interests totaling $3.35 billion as of December 31, 2024 . d partnership interests include $7.73 billion in private equity funds, $1.24 billion in real estate funds and $285 million of interests in other funds . Short-term investments primarily comprise money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury bills, fixed income securities with a contractual maturity of one year or less at time of acquisition .\n As of December 31, 2024, Allstate. es. (“EMA’s limited partnerships) limited partnerships. es                (2)                                                 (1)                 (2)                                                               “Unrealized net capital gains and losses, pre-tax.                                 ‚��™: $1,000, $1,100,000  $2,100 $ 1,100  $ 2,000    $ 1,200,000 .\n In general, gross unrealized losses are related to an increase in market yields, which may include increased risk-free interest rates and wider credit spreads since the time of initial purchase . Gross unrealized gains reflect a decrease in market yield since the purchase . The Allstate Corporation is comprised of transportation and communications sectors .\n Investments increased 24.8% or $614 million in 2024 compared to 2023 . Market-based investment results continue to benefit from portfolio repositioning into higher yielding fixed income securities and higher investment balances . Investment income, before expense: $3,407.407.2,792.677.677 (2,92)\n The company typically employs a lag in recording and recognizing changes in valuations of limited partnership interests due to the availability of investee financial statements . Investment results and income can vary significantly between periods and are influenced by economic conditions, equity market  performance, comparable public company earnings multiples, capitalization rates, capitalized rates, operating performance of the underlying investments and the timing of asset sales .\n The Allstate Corporation’s Form 10-K form 10,K form has been filed . The company has reported losses on sales of fixed income securities and losses on foreign currency contracts in both 2024 and 2023 . See Note 9 for further details of the company's financial results (“Ges”)\n 2023 primarily related to gains on sales and increased valuation of equity investments, partially offset by increased credit losses . The active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations . We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges:  Rebalance existing asset or liability portfolios.\n The Enterprise Risk and Return Council (“ERRC”) oversees the aggregate risk of Allstate and its subsidiaries . ERRC evaluates the risk tolerance of each subsidiary and determines the size of the company's investment portfolio . The ERRC uses a number of measures to measure, monitor and manage market risk .\n The selection of measures used in our sensitivity analysis should not be construed as our prediction of future market events, but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event . In general, we establish investment portfolio asset allocation and market risk limits based upon a combination of these measures . The asset allocation limits place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class .\n As of December 31, 2024, the fixed income portfolio duration, including the effects of interest rate derivatives, was 5.3 compared to 4.8 as of December 31, 2023 . To mitigate this risk, we ladder the maturity dates of our debt . For further detail regarding our debt and our preferred stock, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements .\n The risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the levels of equity indices, the value of individual stocks, or private market valuations related to our limited partnership interests . As of December 31, 2024, we held $4.00 billion in equity investments that comprise equity securities, excluding those with fixed income securities as their underlying investments, compared to $1.52 billion as of December 31, 2023 .\n For limited partnership interests, quarterly changes in fair values may not be highly correlated to equity indices in the short term . Changes in value of these investments are generally recognized on a three-month delay due to the availability of the related investee financial statements . Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates .\n Allstate shareholders’ equity increased in 2024, primarily due to net income, partially offset by dividends to shareholders, common share repurchases and a net loss . In 2024, we paid dividends of $962 million and $117 million related to our common and preferred shares, respectively . The Sen. bilities in foreign currencies.\n The Allstate Corporation has acquired 793 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $43.23 billion . Since 1995, total common shares outstanding has decreased by 634 million shares or 70.5%, primarily due to our repurchase programs . Moody's ratings are influenced by many factors including asset quality, liquidity, and overall portfolio mix .\n The Allstate Corporation (the “Corporation” and Allstate Insurance Company (“AIC”) affirmed the Corporation’s senior debt and short-term issuer ratings of BBB+ and A-2, respectively, in May 2024 . The outlook for the ratings is stable .\n In August 2024, A.M. Best downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of A- for the members of Allstate New Jersey Group . The outlook for the rating is negative . ANJ writes auto and homeowners insurance in New Jersey, which has an A’ from Demotech, that was affirmed in December 2024 .\n As of December 31, 2024, total statutory surplus is $18.64 billion compared to $14.56 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023 . Property and casualty subsidiaries surplus was $18 .24 billion . The NAIC analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios . Additional regulatory scrutiny may occur if a company’s ratios fall outside the usual ranges .\n Capital support is generally at management’s discretion unless contractual commitments are in place . We manage our short-term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets as they come due in the normal course of business . Long-term obligations include known contractual commitments that require cash needs beyond 12 months .\n We actively manage our financial position and liquidity levels in light of changing market, economic, and business conditions . As of December 31, 2024, cash and estimated liquidity available within one quarter, under normal market conditions and at current market prices, was $28.20 billion . Certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity .\n The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities . A rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities . The maximum amount of potential funding under each of these agreements is $1.00 billion . AIC serves as a lender and borrower, certain other subsidiaries serve only as borrowers .\n The payment of dividends by AIC to The Allstate Corporation is limited by Illinois insurance law to formula amounts based on statutory net income and statutory surplus, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months . No dividends were paid in 2024, 2023 or 2022 . For the year ended December 31, 2024, AIC was allowed to pay $1.20 billion . No capital contributions were paid by the Corporation to AIC in 2024 .\n The Corporation and AIC have access to a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility that is available for short-term liquidity requirements . The facility is fully subscribed among 11 lenders with the largest commitment being $95 million . In 2024, we did not defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions .\n There were no borrowings under the credit facility during 2024 . The Corporation has access to a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that was filed on April 30, 2024 and expires in 2027 . The specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements .\n The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts that are our best estimates . We estimate the present value of cash payments to be made to contractholders and policyholders . We are currently making payments for contracts where the timing of a portion or all of the payments has been determined by the contract . Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, customer lapse and withdrawal activity .\n The Allstate Corporation has agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization . Limited partnership interests are typically funded over the commitment period, which is shorter than the contractual expiration date of the partnership and as a result, the actual timing of the funding may vary .\n ERRM governance includes board oversight, an executive management committee, and enterprise and market-facing business chief risk officers . The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for oversight of management’s design and implementation of the ERRM framework . The Audit Committee (“AC”) and the Risk and Return Committee (RRC) oversee ERRM activities .\n The ERRC consists of Allstate’s chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chief risk officer . The ERRM framework focuses on assessment, transparency and dialogue, which provides a comprehensive view of risks and is used by senior management and business managers to drive risk-return based decisions . Management and the ERRC utilize internal and external perspectives to determine an appropriate level of target economic capital .\n Sensitivity testing and scenario analysis are used to gauge the robustness of Allstate’s risk, capital and liquidity positions . Analysis of extremely low-frequency scenarios is also used to assess the sufficiency of capital and contingency options under worst-case outcomes . The impact of strategic initiatives on enterprise risk is evaluated through this context .\n Allstate’s risk management strategies adapt to changes in business and market environments . The company establishes risk limits and capital targets specific to each business unit . Allstate designs business and enterprise strategies that seek to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital . Risks are managed at both the legal entity and enterprise level, but the overall strategy is coordinated at the enterprise level .\n Allstate uses sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques to measure, monitor and manage associated risk exposures, including stochastic risk estimation and deterministic scenario analysis . Areas of focus include macroeconomic conditions and potential changes to key variables such as interest rates, credit spreads and equity price levels, as well as specific factors that may impact the returns associated with individual investments .\n An integrated Operational Risk and Return Management framework is anchored to the ERRM Learning Loop . Culture risk and return management addresses risks and opportunities associated with company culture . Capital at the insurance companies significantly exceeds regulatory risk-based capital requirements and capital levels at the parent holding company provide liquidity and financial flexibility to meet enterprise requirements .\n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements . Management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain . Changes in these estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact .\n Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . We use independent third-party valuation service providers, broker quotes and internal pricing methods to determine fair values . We utilize one quote or price to value each financial instrument in our financial statements .\n Executing valuation models effectively requires seasoned professional judgment and experience . For certain equity securities, valuation service providers provide market quotations for completed transactions on the measurement date . In cases where market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied varies inversely with the availability of market observable information . The fair value of certain financial assets is developed using valuation methods and models widely accepted in the financial services industry .\n The determination of fair value using discounted cash flow models involves management judgment when significant model inputs are not based on or corroborated by market observable data . We gain assurance that our financial assets are appropriately valued through the execution of various processes and controls designed to ensure the overall reasonableness and consistent application of valuation methodologies, including inputs and assumptions, and compliance with accounting standards .\n On a continuing basis, we assess the reasonableness of individual fair values that have stale security prices or that exceed certain thresholds . We perform procedures to understand and assess the methodologies, processes and controls of valuation service providers . When fair value determinations are expected to be more variable, we validate them through reviews by management who have relevant expertise .\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not adjust fair values provided by our valuation service providers or brokers or substitute them with an internal model for such securities . If evidence indicates that prices are based on transactions that are not orderly, we place little, if any, weight on the transaction price .\n For each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position, we assess whether management with the appropriate authority has made the decision to sell or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis . The determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective, and methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security .\n If we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income security, a credit loss allowance is recorded in earnings for the shortfall in expected cash flows . The estimated fair value of collateral will be used to estimate recovery value if we determine that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement .\n Goodwill is recognized when acquired and allocated to reporting units based on which unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination . The decrease was related to the reclassification of goodwill as held for sale as of December 31, 2024 due to the pending sale of the employer voluntary benefits business . Allstate Protection, Protection Services, and Allstate Health and Benefits are equivalent to our reportable segments to which goodwill has been assigned .\n Market to book multiples represent the mean market to book multiple for selected peer units . The outputs are weighted based on the relative amount of market observable assumptions supporting the estimates . Changes in market inputs or other factors, including discount rates, could result in a decline in fair value, resulting in a charge to income .\n Allstate Protection’s current period claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little lag between the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported . Liability losses, especially those involving litigation, can take many years to resolve . Run-off Property-Liability involves long-tail losses, such as those related to asbestos and environmental claims, which often involve substantial reporting lags .\n Development factors are calculated f. ated which compare current period results to results in the prior period for each accident year or report year . The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process . The estimation methodology may require modification when data changes due to changing claim reporting practices, changing claim settlement patterns, external regulatory or financial influences, or contractual coverage changes .\n Reserves are reestimated quarterly and periodically throughout the year by combining historical results with current actual results to calculate new development factors . New development factors are likely to differ from previous development factors used in prior reserve estimates . The difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves (the previous estimate) is the amount of reserve reestimate .\n Allstate Protection reserves are based on actual claim frequency and severity assumptions for different business segments, lines and coverages based on historical relationships to relevant inflation indicators . Reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using processes described above . These estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances, including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid and historical trends involving claim payment patterns .\n Changes in auto claim frequency may result from changes in mix of business, driving behaviors, miles driven or other macroeconomic factors . Changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials . Injury claims are affected largely by medical inflation, treatment trends, attorney representation and litigation costs . Physical damage claims  are affected by auto repair cost inflation, used car prices, length of claim resolution and timing of receipt of third-party carrier claims .\n Historical development trends are less predictive of future loss development, potentially creating additional reserve variability . The highest degree of uncertainty in estimates for most of our losses from ongoing businesses arise from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year . Most of these losses relate to damaged property such as damaged property .\n During the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled . After the second year, the losses that we pay typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation . Reserve estimates, by their nature, are very complex to determine, subject to significant judgment .\n An actuarial technique (stochastic modeling) is applied to the countrywide data for paid losses combined with case reserves for each of auto liability, auto physical damage, and homeowners insurance excluding catastrophes . The variability of these reserve estimates within one standard deviation of the mean is believed by management to represent a reasonable and statistically probable measure of potential variability .\n The reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense, net of recoverables, is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of reported and unreported claims arising from losses which had occurred by the date of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position . The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted .\n In general, our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and application of historical loss development factors . However, depending on the nature of the catastrophe, the estimation process can be further complicated . Complications could include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses, limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses .\n Claims and claims expense reserves include reserves for Michigan unlimited PIP coverage to insureds involved in qualifying motor vehicle accidents . The administration of this program is through the MCCA, a state-mandated, non-profit association of which all insurers writing automobile coverage in Michigan are members . A significant portion of incurred claim reserves can be attributed to a small number of catastrophic claims and thus a large portion of the recoverable is similarly concentrated .\n As actual cost to settle may be greater or less than previously estimated amounts . Other run-off claims relate to general liability and product liability related to medical devices and other products, such as those for medical devices . Asbestos claims relate primarily to those who were exposed to certain types of material, including those who have been exposed to asbestos, are subject to liability .\n Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage . The Allstate Corporation’s exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct excess commercial insurance or direct primary commercial insurance . Our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct excess business .\n An annual review in the third quarter to evaluate, establish and adjust as necessary, asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims reserves . Changes to reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined . The number and cost of these claims are affected by advertising by trial lawyers seeking asbestos plaintiffs, and entities with asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities .\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, IBNR was 54.0% and 55.7% of combined net asbestos and environmental reserves . Establishing net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of property and casualty claims .\n Allstate reserves for asbestos, environmental and other run-off exposures could be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial decisions . There can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost-efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims .\n Management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful net loss reserve range . Historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the Property and Casualty Insurance Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A . We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with actuarial standards and practices . The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts .\n Approximately 90% of our benefit obligation relates to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan . Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies . These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, inflation and expected returns on plan assets, mortality and other factors .\n gnize the remeasurement of the benefit obligation and plan assets in earnings as it provides greater transparency of our economic obligations in accounting results . The primary factors contributing to pension and postretirement gains and losses are: . changes in the discount rate used to value pension . obligations as of the measurement date; . differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets; . 3) changes in demographic assumptions, including mortality and participant experience .\n The discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date . Significant changes in discount rates such as those caused by changes in the credit spreads, yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments may result in volatility in pension cost .\n Short-term asset performance can differ significantly from the expected rate of return, especially in volatile markets . In 2024, the actual return on plan assets was lower than the expected return primarily due to lower fixed income valuations driven by higher rates, partially offset by higher equity valuations . Demographic assumptions affect both our pension and postretirement plans and include retirement rates and participation rates .\n The company is subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business . The effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation .\n The Allstate Corporation and Subsidiaries of Operations (Allstate)   The llstate Corporation    reportedly reported financial statements of operations of the company and Subsidiary of Operations were ended December 31, 2009 . llstate Corp.
