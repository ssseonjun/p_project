Competitive pressures may cause the Company and our bottling partners to reduce prices we charge customers . E‑commerce may create additional consumer price deflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy route-to-market strategies .\n Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results . Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in, and the blurring of the lines between, retail channels . In developed markets, discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace .\n Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets . The loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance .

Our practices are generally developed from, and benchmarked against, recognized cybersecurity frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework .\n We do not believe that there are currently any cybersecurity risks associated with third parties . We conduct tests that help discover potential vulnerabilities, including external penetration testing and tabletop and other exercises, to evaluate our core information systems and cybersecurity practices that enable improved decision-making and prioritization . As part of our overall risk mitigation strategy, the Company also maintains cybersecurity insurance coverage .\n We have been the target of cyberattacks and expect them to continue as cybersecurity threats have been rapidly evolving in sophistication and becoming more prevalent in the industry . We cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats or provide assurances that we have not experienced an undetected cybersecurity incident in the past or that we will not experience such an incident ."
