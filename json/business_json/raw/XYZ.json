  "item1_text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOur Business\nAt Block, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, \"Block\" or \"we\"), we are building an ecosystem dedicated to economic empowerment and unlocking access to the financial system for people around the world. We do this by building the most relevant products and tools for the communities we serve including sellers, consumers, artists, fans and developers. Our brands work together cohesively, often positively reinforcing one another and creating resonant relationships with people who use our products to meet multiple needs across the different aspects of their lives. As we scale, we are focused on investing in building deeper connections between our ecosystems and increasing the resilience of our company.\nOn December 1, 2021, we changed our corporate name from Square, Inc. to Block, Inc. Block is the name for the company as a corporate entity. Since our start in 2009 with the Square business, we have added Cash App, and relatively nascent businesses with TIDAL and two bitcoin businesses, Bitkey and Proto. \nOur two reportable segments are Square, formerly referred to as Seller, and Cash App, which reflects our two primary ecosystems and the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") reviews and assesses performance. \nSquare Ecosystem\nWe started Block with the Square ecosystem in February 2009 to enable businesses (\"sellers\") to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to many businesses. As our company grew, we recognized that sellers need a variety of solutions to thrive and saw how we could apply our strength in technology and innovation to help sellers. We have since expanded Square into a cohesive commerce ecosystem that provides more than 30 distinct products and services to help our sellers start, run, and grow their businesses. We combine software, hardware, and financial services to create products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant. These attributes differentiate Square in a fragmented industry that traditionally forced sellers to stitch together products and services from multiple vendors, and often rely on inefficient non-digital processes and tools. Our ability to add new sellers efficiently, help them grow their business, and cross-sell our products and services has historically contributed to our long-term growth. \nCash App Ecosystem\nCash App provides an ecosystem of financial products and services to help consumers manage their money. Cash App’s goal is to redefine the world’s relationship with money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible. While Cash App started with the single ability to send and receive money, it now provides an ecosystem of financial services focused on helping consumers make their money go further by enabling customers to store, send, receive, spend, invest, buy now, pay later (\"BNPL\"), borrow or save their money with Cash App. Similar to our Square ecosystem, we believe the aggregation of these products into one app differentiates Cash App from competitors and provides greater utility for customers, allowing Cash App to build retentive relationships with its customers. Over time, with its bank partners, Cash App is aiming to become one of the top providers of banking services to households in the United States that earn up to $150,000 per year. \nTIDAL Ecosystem\nTIDAL expands our purpose of economic empowerment to artists. TIDAL is a global platform for musicians and their fans that uses unique content, experiences, and features to bring fans closer to artists and to provide artists with tools to succeed as entrepreneurs. TIDAL offers an extensive catalog of more than 162 million songs and 927,000 high-quality videos. TIDAL has a global presence with listeners in more than 60 countries and relationships with more than 300 labels and distributors.\n4\nBitcoin Ecosystem\nOur bitcoin ecosystem includes our bitcoin hardware projects, which include Bitkey, a self-custody bitcoin wallet, Proto, a bitcoin mining system, as well as Spiral, an independent team focused on contributing to bitcoin open source work. We believe our bitcoin ecosystem can help address inefficiencies in the current financial system, especially with respect to identity and trust. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced our decision to wind down TBD, which was an open developer platform for decentralized finance.\nOur Customers\nOur Square Sellers\nSquare sellers represent a diverse range of industries (including services, food-related, and retail businesses) and sizes, ranging from sole proprietors to multinational businesses. Square sellers span geographies, including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, and Spain. We believe the diversity of our sellers underscores the accessibility and flexibility of our offerings. We have also increasingly served mid-market sellers, which we define as sellers that generate more than $500,000 in annualized Square Gross Payment Volume (“Square GPV”), due to our ability to offer more flexible and complex solutions than traditional alternatives, as well as a growing product suite. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, none of our customers accounted for greater than 5% of Square GPV. We define Square GPV as the total dollar amount of all card and bank payments processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds. \nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, more than 4 million sellers used the Square ecosystem to make 5.2 billion individual sales transactions totaling $228 billion of Square GPV. These sales transactions originated from more than 800 million payment cards, across more than 300 million buyer profiles. \nThe charts below show the percentage mix of our Square GPV by seller industry and seller size for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n5\nOur Cash App Customers\nAs of December 2024, Cash App had 57 million monthly transacting actives across the United States. In 2024, Cash App was the number one finance app on Google Play and number two finance app on iOS based on downloads in the United States. Cash App has a diverse mix of customers and, in the United States, had monthly transacting actives in each of the 50 states and nearly every county as of December 2024. \nIn 2024, Cash App transacting actives brought $283 billion in inflows into Cash App. Customers can fund their Cash App accounts with inflows in a variety of ways, including by receiving money from another Cash App customer through the app’s core peer-to-peer transfer service, transferring money from a bank account, depositing mobile checks, adding physical cash at participating retailers, and receiving a recurring paycheck by direct deposit. In the fourth quarter of 2024, our Cash App monthly transacting actives brought in an average of $1,255 of inflows during the quarter. A transacting active is a Cash App account that has at least one financial transaction using any product or service within Cash App during the specified period. Examples of transactions include sending or receiving a peer-to-peer payment, transferring money into or out of Cash App, making a purchase using Cash App Card, earning a dividend on a stock investment, and paying back a loan, among others. Certain of these accounts may share an alias identifier with one or more other transacting active accounts. This could represent, among other things, one customer with multiple accounts or multiple customers sharing one alias identifier (for example, families).\n6\n7\nOur Products and Services\nSquare Ecosystem\nOur Square ecosystem consists of more than 30 distinct software, hardware, and financial services products. Our products are designed to be self-serve and intuitive to make initial setup and new employee training fast and easy, although we also offer full-service setup and support. Our products are also flexible enough to serve the needs of both small, single location and large, complex multi-location sellers. Our products are integrated to create a seamless experience and enable a holistic view of sales, customers, employees, and finances. We believe the breadth and depth of our products and services provide us unique advantages in best serving the needs of our sellers through a holistic view of their businesses. We supplement these first party capabilities with our open developer platform that enables integrations with third-party applications. We monetize these products through a combination of transaction, subscription, and service fees. \nStrategic Priorities\nOur focus for Square is on four priorities: maintaining our secure, and flexible multi-product platform, providing a “local” experience to sellers of all sizes, growing with artificial intelligence (“AI”), and further developing our banking offering.\n•\nPlatform: \nIt is critical that we have a strong foundation to build upon to serve external customers through our developer platform and partner ecosystem, and our internal team's first party products. This includes increasing reliability of our platform and also introducing products and features that are most important to our customers.\n•\nLocal:\n Our go-to-market strategy is focused on verticals with a local approach, specifically restaurants and services-based businesses. Growing upmarket has shown us that even larger sellers want to feel authentic to their buyers. We can enable this type of robust offering through our technology and by improving the onboarding process through sales and account management.\n•\nArtificial Intelligence (AI):\n We are focused on enabling growth by leveraging AI to increase productivity and outcomes for our sales and marketing, customer service, and engineering efforts, in addition to building features that help sellers grow their businesses.\n8\n•\nBanking:\n Our robust banking offering primarily helps our sellers manage cash flow and grow their business through our lending capabilities. We will continue to drive trust with our sellers, and build products and features that help with sellers accessing funds securely and timely.\nCommerce\nSquare's commerce products help sellers make sales and track orders, inventory, and fulfillment across in-person and online channels, as well as first-party and third-party channels. Most of our Square commerce products have a free tier (without a subscription fee), which we monetize only through transaction fees on card payments. Some commerce products also have premium tiers with additional functionality, which we monetize through subscription fees in addition to transaction fees on payments.\nSquare Point of Sale\n is our primary commerce application for sellers, and provides an easy-to-use, customizable point-of-sale solution that adapts across business types and stages. Over the past year, we have modernized and simplified our Point of Sale applications, combining our vertical software solutions into one Square Point of Sale app, which now includes: \n•\nA vertical solution tailored for both quick-service and full-service restaurants. It includes table, order, and course management; a kitchen display system; and revenue and cost reporting.\n•\nA vertical solution tailored for appointment-based businesses that need a point-of-sale application with integrated booking capabilities. Our features include a free online booking site so buyers can easily schedule appointments and select their preferred time, service, and staff member. It is also integrated with Square Assistant, an AI-enabled automated messaging tool designed to respond to buyers efficiently and professionally, saving sellers' time and helping prevent missed appointments.\n•\nA vertical solution tailored for sellers in the retail industry. It includes advanced inventory management, cost of goods sold reporting, purchase orders, vendor management, and barcode scanning.\n•\nA customizable digital invoicing solution with integrated and secure online payment acceptance. This eliminates the need to print and mail statements to customers and wait for checks to arrive. Sellers use Square Invoices for upcoming, recurring, or previously delivered goods and services, such as catering orders, contractor services, lessons, and retail orders. Square Invoices also lets sellers send estimates and collect partial payments for goods and services.\nOur commerce products also include:\n•\nSquare Online \nmakes it easy to build a website and online store as well as sell on Instagram and Facebook. The online store is mobile responsive, delivering an app-like ordering experience on a buyer’s phone. With integrated support for QR code ordering, sellers can also streamline their in-store operations by posting the QR code and having their buyers order from their own phones. Fulfillment options include pickup, delivery managed by our sellers, and integrations with partner delivery platforms. The system is designed for orders, items, inventory, and customer data to stay in sync when selling both online and in-person.\n•\nSquare Online Checkout\n makes it easy to sell online without a website by allowing sellers to create a checkout link with only a name and price for their good or service.\n•\nSquare Virtual Terminal \nallows sellers to use a computer as a card terminal. Sellers can take a payment, set up recurring billing, record sales, and send digital receipts for payments, including those made by check and bank transfer.\n•\nRisk Manager \ngives sellers insight into online payment fraud patterns and enables them to set custom rules and alerts to manage risk. Machine-learning algorithms are designed to automatically identify fraud patterns and adapt to fit a seller's operations.\n•\nOrder Manager \nallows sellers to manage online orders that originate from Square Online, their own website on another platform, and third-party websites including online marketplaces such as DoorDash. Order Manager enables tracking open orders, managing prep times and busy times, and marking orders as completed.\n9\n•\nPayment APIs \n(application programming interfaces) and SDKs (software development kits) support in-person, online, and mobile payments. Square Reader SDK enables developers to seamlessly integrate Square hardware with a seller’s custom point of sale, allowing them to build unique checkout experiences such as self-ordering kiosks powered by Square’s managed payments service. With Square's online payments APIs, developers can integrate Square payments into a seller’s e-commerce website or online store. Square's In-App Payments SDK enables developers to build consumer mobile apps that use Square to process payments. These products are monetized primarily through transaction fees on payment volumes.\n•\nCommerce APIs: \nSquare offers more than 30 commerce APIs, through which developers can create and manage orders, subscriptions, product catalogs, inventory, customer profiles, employees, loyalty programs, gift cards, and more to build applications that enrich and integrate with Square's ecosystem of products. In addition, these APIs enable developers to build integrations with their existing business systems such as accounting, customer relationship management (“CRM”), employee management, and enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software.\nFor card payments, Square acts as the merchant of record for the transaction as well as the payment service provider (“PSP”). As the merchant of record, Square is the party responsible for settling funds with the seller and helps manage transaction risk loss on behalf of the seller. Square’s managed payments offering for sellers includes payment dispute management, data security, and PCI compliance for a transparent transaction fee paid by sellers. Square has negotiated terms and entered into contractual arrangements directly with other service providers of transaction processing services, including the acquiring processors and card networks, and indirectly with issuing banks. These contracts include negotiated terms, such as more favorable pricing, that are generally not available to sellers if they were to contract directly with these sub-service providers. Square's position as the merchant of record helps us better serve our sellers. For example, as the merchant of record, we can more efficiently onboard new sellers through our website, leveraging our risk assessment models, and we have insights into transaction-level data that we use to inform our sellers and launch new products.\nSoftware\nMost of our Square software products have a free tier (without a subscription fee), which we monetize only through transaction fees on card payments. Most software products also have premium tiers with additional functionality, which we monetize through subscription fees in addition to transaction fees on payments.\nSquare’s Customer capabilities help sellers grow their business. By linking customer data together with online and in-person commerce data, Square can offer sellers integrated omnichannel capabilities to acquire, engage, and retain customers. Square transaction data and reporting allows sellers to easily assess performance and return on investment. We typically monetize these products via service and software fees.\n•\nBNPL \nhelps drive net new demand to sellers via discovery in the Afterpay app and has historically increased average conversion rates and average transaction sizes for new and existing customers across online and in-store channels. \n•\nSquare Loyalty\n helps sellers keep their buyers coming back. We have found that buyers that enroll in a Square Loyalty program have been more than three times as likely to be repeat customers and spend 50% more on average.\n•\nSquare Marketing\n helps sellers drive traffic by sending emails or texts to promote in-store events, new products, last-minute deals, or seasonal offers. Sellers can set up recurring automated campaigns to welcome new customers, wish them a happy birthday, send abandoned-cart reminders, or reach out to lapsed customers.\n•\nSquare Gift Cards\n help sellers bring in new buyers when their customers purchase gift cards for their friends and family. \n10\nSquare's staff management products give sellers digital tools to streamline their operations. These tools are designed to seamlessly integrate with other Square products eliminating the latent, time-consuming, and error-prone processes typically used to copy and sync data between disparate systems. We typically monetize these products via software fees. \n•\nSquare Team Management\n makes it easy to schedule staff and view team performance and sales analytics in real time. It also enables limiting access to Square software features per employee or role. The Square Team App enables team members to clock in and out, view and adjust their schedules, and see timecards, hours worked, and estimated pay from their mobile phone. \n•\nSquare Payroll\n allows sellers to pay wages and associated employee taxes, and offer employee benefits (e.g. 401(k) accounts). The Square ecosystem drives competitive differentiation for our Payroll product with the ability to use Payroll in conjunction with our point-of-sale products, Team Management, and Cash App.\nFinancial Services\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Square Financial Services, Inc. (“Square Financial Services”) and with our third-party bank partners, we offer a growing number of banking services that make it easier for sellers to manage cash flow and get faster access to funds. \n•\nSquare Lending \nprovides a platform of lending products to qualified Square sellers. Square Loans (formerly Square Capital) facilitates loans to qualified Square sellers through Square Financial Services, which is an industrial loan company (“ILC\"). Square Loans eliminates the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process. We are able to approve sellers for these loans by using our unique data set of the seller’s Square transactions to help facilitate loan underwriting and collections, which mitigates risks. Generally, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are sized to be less than 20% of a seller's expected annual Square GPV and, by simply running their business, sellers historically have repaid their loans within nine months on average. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis, which mitigates our balance sheet and liquidity risk. Since its public launch in May 2014, Square Loans has facilitated more than 3.1 million loans and advances, representing more than $25.8 billion in principal amount loaned or advanced. We launched Square Credit Card in 2023 to provide another lending option to qualified Square sellers. \n•\nInstant Transfer \nenables sellers to receive funds from their payments instantly or later that same day. Instant Transfer is an important tool for sellers that need faster access to their funds in order to better manage their cash flow or working capital. \n•\nSquare Checking \nprovides sellers with an account provided by our bank partner that is eligible for FDIC deposit insurance if certain conditions are met. Square Checking gives sellers instant access to their sales and the ability to immediately use those funds via a debit card (Square Debit Card), withdraw funds from an ATM, or transfer funds via ACH.\n•\nSquare Savings \nis an FDIC-insured, interest earning business savings account at Square Financial Services, with no monthly fees or minimums, designed to make cash flow management easier for sellers. With Square Savings, sellers can easily and automatically put aside a portion of their sales in their savings account while also organizing their money within folders, streamlining the process of saving funds for specific goals and priorities, such as quarterly tax obligations.\n11\nHardware\nSquare custom-designs hardware that can process all major card payment forms, including magnetic stripe, EMV chip, and NFC (contactless). Sellers are able to accept cards issued by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB (in Japan), Interac Flash (in Canada), e-Money (in Japan), and eftpos (in Australia). Square hardware can be integrated with additional accessories such as cash drawers, receipt printers, scales, and barcode scanners to provide sellers with a comprehensive point-of-sale solution. Square's hardware portfolio includes the following:\n•\nSquare Register \nis an all-in-one offering that combines our hardware, point-of-sale software, and payments technology. The dedicated hardware consists of two screens: a seller display and a customer display with a built-in card reader that accepts tap, dip, and swipe payments. \n•\nSquare Terminal \nis a portable, all-in-one payments device and receipt printer to replace traditional keypad terminals. It accepts tap, dip, and swipe payments, enabling payments anywhere in the store. \n•\nSquare Stand\n enables an iPad to be used as a payment terminal or full point-of-sale solution. It features an integrated contactless and chip reader. \n•\nSquare Reader for contactless and chip \naccepts EMV chip cards and NFC payments, enabling acceptance via Apple Pay, Google Pay, and other mobile wallets. \n•\nSquare Reader \nfor magstripe enables swiped transactions of magnetic-stripe cards by connecting with an iOS or Android smartphone or tablet via the headphone jack or Lightning connector.\nCash App Ecosystem\nWith Cash App, we are building an ecosystem of financial products and services that helps consumers manage their money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible. Cash App is primarily in the United States and has a diverse set of customers across demographics and regions. We use our inflows framework to assess the performance of Cash App across transacting actives, inflows per active, and the monetization rate on inflows. \nStrategic Priorities\nCash App sits at the intersection of three traditionally-distinct use cases: financial services, community based transactions (peer-to-peer payments) and commerce. Our approach for Cash App is to combine these three areas together in a unique manner to define a new product category and reinvent banking for our customers. With its bank partners, Cash App aims to become one of the top providers of banking services to households in the United States that earn up to $150,000 per year. To achieve this, we have a three-part strategy: \n(1) bank our base, (2) move upmarket by serving families, and (3) build the next-generation social bank.\n The majority of our near term focus and current investments are on Banking our Base, the first part of our strategy, where we see the most direct opportunity to drive meaningful top line growth for Cash App. As part of our strategy we plan to continue to build \ntrust\n with our customers and enhance our safety, security, and support for current and prospective customers.\n•\nBank Our Base:\n Cash App Card is generally customers’ entry point into a deeper banking relationship with Cash App. Beyond Cash App Card, we want to provide other banking services to our customers through our third-party bank partners. Cash App offers a compelling financial services offering to eligible customers that utilize direct deposit on a monthly basis, including an attractive savings rate, free in-network ATM withdrawals, free overdraft coverage up to a certain amount, and priority phone support. We plan to continue launching additional products and features to strengthen our value proposition and also to invest in incentives and marketing to drive awareness and adoption of direct deposit.\n12\n•\nMove Upmarket by Serving Families:\n Over the last few years, we made Cash App available to individuals aged 13 and older, first starting with Cash App Card and peer to peer transfers and then expanding into additional banking features. We’ve been focused on building trust and safety for teens and their parents by giving parents transparency into their family’s activity, allowing them to set permissions, and offering a robust set of oversight and controls. Through this effort, we’re positioning Cash App for long-term growth by serving families in the near-term and then growing with our teen customer base as they mature, their income grows, and they engage more deeply with the full suite of banking products and financial services that Cash App offers through our third-party bank partners.\n•\nBuild the Next-Generation Social Bank: \nWe are continuing to invest in building our social-driven feature set through areas like expanded profile functionality, sharing/recommendations, and exploring new ways for our customer base to transact together through financial services that have historically been disconnected from the community. A big part of this vision is linking Square’s local priority with Cash App. We want to enable more local commerce by connecting our two largest ecosystems, with Cash App customers buying from Square sellers. \nInflows and Outflows\nCustomers can use Cash App to inflow funds in a variety of ways, including by receiving money from another Cash App customer through the app’s core peer-to-peer transfer service, transferring money from a bank account, depositing mobile checks, adding physical cash at participating retailers, receiving a recurring paycheck by direct deposit, and through other inflow channels. These funds can then be sent to another customer through the app, spent anywhere that accepts Visa cards or Cash App Pay, withdrawn from an ATM using the Cash App Card, invested in stocks or exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), used to buy bitcoin, or transferred to a bank account (either instantly for a fee or for free in one to three days). \nTrust\nWe serve our customers through a broad suite of financial services, and earning their trust is a key factor in how we can deepen our financial relationship with them. The breadth of our financial service offerings allows us to increase our share of wallet as well as expand our customer base to serve a wider variety of demographics. We develop trust with customers by offering reliable, easy, and secure access to their accounts and convenient support. We also adapt the amount of funds a customer can bring in through specific channels based on risk profile, and as we improve our understanding of a customer’s identity. We believe building and maintaining deep trust with our customers will drive greater product adoption and increased inflows into our ecosystem.\nProduct Categories\nBanking Services\nThrough third-party bank partners, we offer a growing number of banking services that are designed to make it easier for customers to manage cash flow and provide them with fast access to funds. \n•\nCash App Card\n is a debit card, issued by our bank partner, and linked directly to a customer’s Cash App balance. Customers can order a Cash App Card for free and use it anywhere that accepts Visa cards to make purchases, drawing down from the funds stored in their Cash App balance. Cash App earns interchange fees when individuals make purchases with their Cash App Card. Customers can select new or promotional Cash App Card designs for a fee, and can also withdraw funds from an ATM using the Cash App Card. Customers can also purchase and send gift cards at specific merchants to other customers, and recipients can spend them with their Cash App Card.\n•\nDirect deposit\n capabilities, in alliance with our bank partner and system processor, allow customers to receive their recurring paycheck, tax refund, or government disbursement into their Cash App account, which they can then use to send, spend, store, or invest.\n•\nSavings\n allows customers to hold a separate savings balance at our bank partner, and easily set and track towards financial goals. Customers can add money to Savings using their Cash App balance, a linked debit card, or through Round Ups on purchases with Cash App Card.\n13\n•\nCash Offers (formerly Boost)\n is a free and instant rewards program that offers customers discounts at specific businesses (e.g., 10% off a purchase on DoorDash) or at certain business types (e.g., grocery stores). Customers can select the Cash Offers they want to apply to their Cash App Card, and the discount is instantly applied to their Cash App balance for eligible transactions. Some Cash Offers are selected and funded by Cash App, while others are funded by our partners. Costs related to the Cash App rewards program that are funded by Cash App are recognized as reductions to revenue.\n•\nCash App Borrow: \nWe believe credit is an area within our financial services offerings where we can provide simple, fair, and accessible products that promote financial health. Cash App Borrow, our first credit product for consumers, allows customers to access short-term loans for a small fee. The product offers eligible Cash App customers up to $1,000 at any one time that they can pay back in scheduled installments or as a percentage of what they receive into Cash App. We determine a Cash App customer’s eligibility based on prudent risk management by using our unique data set that includes a customer’s inflows and engagement on Cash App. The average Cash App Borrow loan was repaid in less than four weeks in 2024.\nBNPL Platform\nCash App is focused on driving greater commerce between consumers and merchants. Our BNPL platform facilitates commerce between retail merchants and consumers by allowing its retail merchant clients to offer their customers the ability to buy goods and services on a BNPL basis. Our BNPL platform provides consumers the ability to get desired items now but pay for them later, while simultaneously helping merchants increase sales and order values. We have a range of products across our BNPL platform.\n•\nPay in 4:\n Through the use of our BNPL platform, consumers can split their purchases into generally three or four installments, typically due in two-week increments, without paying fees (if payments are made on time). We pay retail merchants the full order value up front (less a percentage fee) and assume the risk of non-payment from the consumer.\n•\nMonthly Payment Solution:\n We also offer the ability for consumers to pay for larger transaction sizes over a six- or twelve-month period using a monthly payment option. The structure of the product includes no late fees and no compounding interest with a cap on total interest owed. Similar to Pay in 4, we pay retail merchants the full order value up front (less a percentage fee) and assume the risk of non-payment from the consumer.\n•\nAdvertising and affiliate:\n Our BNPL platform generates hundreds of millions of leads each year for merchants and has channeled this demand towards scaling an ads and affiliate program for its merchants: for affiliate relationships, we receive a commission when a consumer begins their shopping journey in the Afterpay App and makes a purchase. We may also receive digital advertising revenue based on clicks to a merchant site from the Afterpay App as well as flat fees for premium ad placements.\n•\nShop directory:\n We operate an online shop directory, which allows consumers to search by product category for stores that offer Afterpay as a payment option.\n•\nAfterpay Card, Afterpay Plus Card:\n We offer two in-store cards that allow consumers to pay in 4 for in-person transactions at a merchant’s point of sale. The Afterpay Card allows consumers to shop in-store at Afterpay merchants and is free for the consumer. The Afterpay Plus Card is currently available to select Afterpay consumers in certain regions for a monthly fee and allows them to shop in-store anywhere that Apple Pay or Google Pay is accepted.\nCommunity\nPeer-to-peer payments form the basis of our Community development pillar because customers engage in financial transactions with other members of the Cash App community. When customers use peer-to-peer, they are inviting their friends, family, and coworkers to download Cash App so that they can send each other money. Peer-to-peer becomes more useful for our customers as their communities expand, so our customers are naturally incentivized to bring more people into their networks. We offer the peer-to-peer service to our Cash App customers for free when a linked debit account is used to fund a transaction, as we consider peer-to-peer to be a marketing tool to encourage Cash App usage. We charge a fee to the sender when transactions are funded using a credit card, and a fee to the recipient if it is a business account.\n14\nInstant Deposit was the first feature we started monetizing on Cash App. Customers are able to instantly transfer funds from Cash App to a bank account for a small fee. We believe our customer base values fast access to funds, and this speed is one example of how we differentiate our ecosystem.\nCash App Pay\nCash App Pay is a simple, mobile-friendly way for Cash App customers to pay at merchants across online and in-person channels. Cash App Pay allows customers to seamlessly pay with a Cash App account at participating merchants like DoorDash, Lyft, Google Play Store, Temu, and many more, including thousands of Square sellers. For in-person and desktop web transactions customers simply scan a merchant’s QR code at checkout. On mobile devices, customers can click the Cash App Pay button at checkout for a payment process that is fast, elegantly designed, and secure.\nBitcoin\nWe have a simple bitcoin exchange and custody solution that provides customers with an onramp and offramp to buy and sell bitcoin with Cash App for as little as $1 and a custodial account to store it securely without needing to keep track of any private keys. Our solution offers features that allow customers to complete auto buys and custom limit orders, as well as direct deposit to auto-convert their paycheck into bitcoin and earn instant bitcoin rewards on Cash App Card purchases. \nWe have also focused on payments through bitcoin. Given our network scale, we believe Cash App can help bitcoin evolve beyond an asset class and enable transactional utility, which is why we launched our offering in 2018 with the ability to deposit and withdraw bitcoin across the blockchain. We have since added the ability for customers to send bitcoin across the Cash App network to any phone number or $Cashtag, creating an easy-to-use off-chain network for bitcoin payments that settles instantly between transacting actives. We also allow U.S. actives to send and receive bitcoin to/from anyone with a compatible wallet via the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a second layer technology applied to the bitcoin blockchain that enables faster transactions with little to no fees.\nTax Preparation\nCash App Taxes provides a seamless, mobile-first solution for consumers to file their taxes for free.\nStock Brokerage \nCustomers can also use Cash App to invest their funds for free in U.S. listed stocks and ETFs. We believe this makes investing more accessible by giving customers access to hundreds of listed stocks and ETFs that they can purchase using their Cash App balance or a linked debit card for as little as $1. Once the order is filled, all investments are viewable through the stocks applet.\nBusiness Accounts\n    \nCash App allows business accounts to collect payments for their business by accepting peer-to-peer transactions for a fee, while allowing higher weekly limits and providing relevant tax reporting forms.\nSales and Marketing\nSquare Ecosystem\nThe Square ecosystem has a strong brand affinity among its sellers. Our Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) has averaged 53 over the past four quarters, which is notably higher than the average score for banking providers. Our high NPS means Square sellers recommend our services to others, which we believe strengthens the Square brand and helps drive efficient customer acquisition. \nDirect marketing, online and offline, has also been an effective customer acquisition channel. These tactics include online search engine optimization and marketing, online display advertising, direct mail campaigns, direct response television advertising, mobile advertising, and affiliate and seller referral programs. \n15\nOur direct sales and account management teams also contribute to the acquisition and support of larger sellers. Historically, our sales team was primarily focused on converting inbound leads from interest generated through other acquisition channels, and in more recent years, we have built out an outbound sales team focused on outreach to new prospective sellers. These outbound sales were traditionally done remotely via telephone. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we began hiring a field sales team to focus exclusively on in-person seller outreach to further increase acquisition of larger sellers.\nOur direct, ongoing interactions with our sellers help us tailor offerings to them, at scale, and in the context of their usage. We use various scalable communication channels such as email marketing, in-product notifications and messaging, and Square Communities, our online forum for sellers, to increase the awareness and usage of our products and services with little incremental sales and marketing expense. Our customer support team also helps increase awareness and usage of our products as part of helping sellers address inquiries and issues.\nIn addition to direct channels, we work with third-party developers and other partners who offer our solutions to their customers. Partners expand our addressable market to sellers with individualized or industry-specific needs. Through the Square App Marketplace, Square partners are able to expand their own addressable market by reaching the millions of sellers using Square. As of December 31, 2024, Square had more than 900 managed partners connected to its platform.\nCash App Ecosystem\nCash App has also developed a strong brand, which can be traced back to our compelling features, self-serve experience, unique design, and engaging marketing. \nPeer-to-peer transactions serve as the primary acquisition channel for Cash App. Peer-to-peer transactions have powerful network effects as every time a customer sends or requests money, Cash App can potentially acquire a new customer or re-engage an existing customer. We have enhanced the efficiency of peer-to-peer transfers by streamlining the onboarding process for Cash App, enabling customers to sign up in minutes. We offer the peer-to-peer service to our Cash App customers for free, and we consider it to be a marketing tool to encourage the usage of Cash App. We do not generate revenue on the majority of peer-to-peer transactions and for these transactions we characterize card issuance costs, peer-to-peer costs, and risk loss as a sales and marketing expense. \nCash App also uses paid marketing, including referrals, advertising spend, partnerships, and social media campaigns, to expand its network, as these programs help reach new customers, enhance its brand, and improve retention among existing customers. Cash App has a dedicated sales team focused on products like BNPL, Monthly Payment Solution, Cash App Pay, and other new and emerging products. This team builds relationships with several of the largest and most well known merchants in the US and relevant international markets for BNPL.\nAdditionally, we see the launch and advertising of new Cash App features as an important way to attract new customers and engage existing customers. Features such as Cash App Card and Offers rewards, bitcoin buying and selling, investing in stocks and ETFs, Cash App Pay, and a tax preparation service enhance Cash App’s utility for customers and provide reasons for consumers to try Cash App. \nProduct Development and Technology\nWe design both our Square and Cash App products and services to be cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant, and product development is a cross-functional effort combining individuals from product management, engineering, data science, analytics, design, and product marketing. Our products and services are platform-agnostic with most supporting iOS, Android, and web. We frequently update our software products and have a rapid software release schedule with improvements deployed regularly. Our services are built on a scalable technology platform, and we place a strong emphasis on data analytics and machine learning to maximize the efficacy, efficiency, and scalability of our services. \nIn our Square ecosystem, this technology platform enables us to capture and analyze billions of transactions per year and automate risk assessment for more than 99.95% of all transactions. Our hardware is designed and developed in-house, and we contract with third-party manufacturers for production.\n16\nOur Competition\nSquare Ecosystem\nThe markets in which our Square ecosystem operates are competitive and evolving. Our competitors range from large, well-established vendors to smaller, earlier-stage companies. We seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors primarily on the basis of our extensive commerce ecosystem and our focus on building remarkable products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant. In addition, we differentiate ourselves by offering transparent pricing, no long-term contracts, and our ability to innovate and reshape the industries we operate in to expand access to traditionally unserved or underserved sellers. With respect to each of these factors, we believe that we compare favorably to our competitors. Competitors that overlap with certain functions and features that we provide include:\n•\nBusiness software providers such as those that provide point of sale, website building, inventory management, employee management, customer relationship management invoicing, and appointment booking solutions;\n•\nPayment terminal vendors;\n•\nMerchant acquirers;\n•\nBanks that provide payment processing, checking, savings, loans, and payroll;\n•\nPen and paper, manual processes, and paper currency;\n•\nPayroll processors; and\n•\nEstablished or new alternative lenders.\nCash App Ecosystem\nCash App competes with other companies in peer-to-peer payments, debit and prepaid cards, credit card rewards, stock trading, tax filing, digital wallet, bitcoin exchanges, BNPL providers, and shopping and consumer demand generation. Our competitors include money transfer apps, prepaid debit card offerings, brokerage firms, tax firms, financial technology apps, banks, and crypto trading services.\nWe compete primarily on our differentiated lifestyle brand, the breadth of our network, the range of products in our ecosystem, and the simplicity and quality of our customer experience. We invest in brand, design, and technology to keep our products fast and simple, while also improving and expanding our features.\nIntellectual Property\nWe seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common law rights in the United States and other countries, as well as on contractual measures. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with other third parties, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology. In addition to these contractual measures, we also rely on a combination of trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, registered domain names, trade secrets, and patent rights to help protect our brand and our other intellectual property. Additionally, we regularly contribute software source code under open source and other permissive licenses and have made other technology we developed available under such licenses, and we include open source software in our products.\nWe have developed a patent program and strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of our products, services, and technologies where appropriate. We also actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks, trade dress, and domain names in the United States and in other jurisdictions. We intend to file additional patent applications as we continue to innovate through our research and development efforts and to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we deem it beneficial and cost-effective, including acquiring patent assets or licensing patent rights from third parties. In addition, we participate in a number of industry organizations that facilitate patent pools or non-assertion commitments, such as the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance that we co-founded, LOT Network, and Open Invention Network.\n17\nGovernment Regulation\nForeign and domestic legal requirements apply to many key aspects of our business. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, monetary penalties, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate. It is also possible that current or future laws or regulations could be interpreted or applied in a manner that would prohibit, alter, or impair our existing or planned products and services, or that could require costly, time-consuming, or otherwise burdensome compliance measures from us.\nPayments Regulation\nVarious laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the United States and globally. For example, certain jurisdictions in the United States require a license to offer money transmission services, such as Cash App’s peer-to-peer payments, and we maintain a license in each of those jurisdictions and comply with new license requirements as they arise. We are also registered as a “Money Services Business” with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\"FinCEN\"). These licenses and registrations subject us, among other things, to record-keeping requirements, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and examination by state and federal regulatory agencies.\nOutside the United States, we provide localized versions of some of our services to customers, including through various foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those non-U.S. entities are, or may be, supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. For instance, we hold an Australian Financial Services License issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to provide non-cash payments in Australia, and we are licensed as an Electronic Money Institution to provide payments services and electronic money in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority and in the European Union by the Central Bank of Ireland.\nOur payments services may be or become subject to regulation by other authorities, and the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are always subject to interpretation and change.\nConsumer Protection\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal, local, state, and foreign regulatory and law enforcement agencies regulate financial products and enforce consumer protection laws, including those applicable to credit, deposit, and payments services, and other similar services. These agencies have broad consumer protection mandates, and they promulgate, interpret, and enforce rules and regulations that affect our business.\nAnti-Money Laundering, Anti-Corruption, and Sanctions\nWe are subject to anti-money laundering (\"AML\"), anti-corruption, and economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. The anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies from making or offering improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. Economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and equivalent applicable foreign authorities prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, or dealings with, specified countries, governments, individuals and entities, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. We have implemented compliance programs and controls designed to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject.\nBank Regulation\nWe obtained approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions to open an ILC. The opening of Square Financial Services, Inc., our ILC, in March 2021 subjects us to direct state and federal regulatory supervision and requires compliance with applicable banking regulations. Our partnerships with FDIC-insured financial institutions to offer certain banking products to customers also subject us to certain federal banking regulations. \n18\nLending Regulation\nVarious laws and regulations govern lending in the United States and internationally. In the United States, Square Capital, LLC holds and maintains lending and collections licenses with state regulators to support lending products offered across the United States. Afterpay US Services, LLC holds and maintains lending licenses to support its product offerings. These lending licenses subject us to the supervision and examination authority of state regulators, and our partnerships with FDIC-insured financial institutions to offer certain lending products to customers subjects us to federal regulation and supervision.\nOutside the United States, we provide localized versions of some of our lending services to customers, including through our various foreign subsidiaries. The activities of our foreign subsidiaries are, or may be, supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, we hold an Australian Credit Licence issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\nOur lending services have been and may continue to be subject to regulation by other applicable authorities or jurisdictions, and the laws and regulations applicable to the lending industry in any given jurisdiction are always subject to interpretation and change.\nBroker-Dealer Regulation\nOur subsidiary, Cash App Investing LLC (\"Cash App Investing\"), operates as a broker-dealer and is therefore registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\"). As a broker-dealer, Cash App Investing is subject to SEC and FINRA rules and regulations concerning matters that include, without limitation, how it markets its services, handles customer assets, keeps records, and reports to the SEC and FINRA. Cash App Investing is also registered in each state where it conducts business, and subject to those states’ securities laws and regulations. \nVirtual Currency Regulation\nWe are subject to certain licensing and supervisory frameworks as a result of our Cash App offering, through which customers can use their stored funds to buy, hold and sell bitcoin, and transfer bitcoin to and from Cash App. We currently hold a New York State BitLicense and a Virtual Currency Business License in Louisiana. The laws and regulations applicable to virtual currency are evolving and subject to interpretation and change. Therefore, our current and future virtual currency services may be or become subject to additional licensing, regulatory requirements and oversight by other state and federal authorities.\nProtection and Use of Information\nWe collect and use a wide variety of information for various purposes in our business, including to help ensure the integrity of our services and to provide features and functionality to our customers. This aspect of our business, including the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of the information we acquire from our own services as well as from third-party sources, is subject to laws and regulations in the United States, the European Union, and elsewhere. Accordingly, we publish our privacy policies and terms of service, which describe our practices concerning the use, transmission, and disclosure of information. As our business continues to expand in the United States and worldwide, and as laws and regulations continue to be passed and their interpretations continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions, additional laws and regulations may become relevant to us.\nCommunications Regulation\nWe send texts, emails, and other communications in a variety of contexts, such as when providing digital receipts and marketing. Communications laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, apply to certain aspects of this activity in the United States and elsewhere.\n19\nAdditional Developments\nVarious legislative bodies and regulatory agencies in the United States and elsewhere in our international markets continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact our business, including privacy, data protection, information security, virtual currencies, identity theft, tax, marketing, and labor and employment matters. As our business continues to develop and expand, additional laws, rules and regulations may become relevant.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, transaction-based revenue for our Square ecosystem has been strongest in our fourth quarter and weakest in our first quarter, as our sellers typically generate additional GPV during the holiday season. Subscription and services-based revenue generally demonstrates less seasonality than transaction-based revenue. Hardware revenue generally demonstrates less seasonality than transaction-based revenue, with most fluctuations tied to periodic product launches, promotions, or other arrangements with our retail partners.\nHistorically, our Cash App ecosystem has experienced improvements in revenue, gross profit, and inflows related to the distribution of government funds as customers have deposited more funds into Cash App during these times, including during the first quarter when U.S. tax refunds are typically distributed. Certain products within Cash App may also experience stronger fourth quarters and weaker first quarters, such as our BNPL platform, which typically generates additional revenue and gross profit during the holiday season. Typical seasonality trends for the Cash App ecosystem are also impacted by bitcoin revenue, which is driven by customer demand and the current market price of bitcoin, and as such, may not be indicative of future performance and skew typical seasonality trends in the Cash App ecosystem.\nHuman Capital \nOur employees are a driving force behind our purpose of economic empowerment. Attracting, developing, and retaining top talent remain a focus in the development of our human capital programs. As of December 31, 2024, we had 11,372 full-time employees worldwide with 2,627 full-time employees outside the US. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations. In November 2023, we announced we would implement an absolute cap of 12,000 on the number of employees we have at our company. We expect to keep this cap in place until we believe the growth of the business has meaningfully outpaced the growth of our company.\nWe have a purpose-driven culture, with a focus on employee input and well-being, which we believe enables us to attract and retain exceptional talent. We offer learning and development programs for all employees, as well as a robust manager training program. Employees have the opportunity to actively voice their questions and thoughts through many internal channels, including our company townhall meetings and bi-annual employee engagement surveys. Our distributed work model means that we no longer have a designated headquarters location and, for the vast majority of roles, employees have the flexibility to work within or outside a Block office space. Our distributed work model has unlocked opportunities to hire and retain talent in more locations, as we can hire employees in locations where we do not have office space, and employees can continue to work for us if they need or want to relocate.\nA key focus of our human capital management approach is our commitment to promoting inclusion and fairness in our workplace. We consider it a business requirement to build a company that reflects the customers and communities we serve. In 2024, we established company-wide manager expectations, including their responsibility to break down silos and hierarchy, maintain physiological safety and seek divergent perspectives. Across our employee programs, we have embedded policies and practices to ensure that hiring, promotion and compensation decisions are based on merit alone.\nFrom a total rewards perspective, Block offers a competitive compensation and benefits package, which is reviewed and updated each year. Our annual compensation planning coincides with our feedback cycle during which employees and managers have performance conversations to facilitate learning and career development. As part of our compensation review program, pay equity analyses are conducted annually.\n20\nCorporate Information\n    \nBlock was incorporated in Delaware in June 2009. In 2020, we adopted a distributed work model and we no longer have a designated headquarters location.
