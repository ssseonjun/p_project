High and rising debt levels in the U.S. and globally may contribute to interest rate volatility, which may constrain governments’ fiscal policies, potentially resulting in adverse economic outcomes . Climate change, acute and/or chronic extreme weather events or natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, military conflicts, terrorism, or other geopolitical events may also be adversely affected .\n Any increases in policy rates, as a response to inflation persistently above central bank targets, could result in higher market interest rates . Elevated or rising interest rates may continue to result in volatility of equity and other markets . Any future change in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, in an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise, resulting in lower interest rates would typically result in lower net interest income .\n High and rising federal debt levels could lead to lower investor appetite for U.S. debt securities, higher interest rates and financial market volatility . Higher interest rates have generally had a positive impact on our net interest income, they have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact investment securities, deposits, loan demand and funding costs .\n Increased market volatility and adverse changes in financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk .

The value of assets under management (AUM) and fee income relating to AUM are affected by market risks .\n The value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates and/or spreads . If interest rates decrease, our results of operations could be negatively impacted . In times of market stress, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated .

Fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices . Sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets .\n Liquidity is essential to our businesses . We fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities . We rely on certain secured funding sources,  such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive . We also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to help fund a portion of our consumer lending activities .\n Several of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control, such as general market volatility, disruption, shock or stress, stress in sovereign debt markets, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics . The impact of these potentially sudden events could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments, unforeseen outflows of cash, the need to draw on liquidity facilities .\n Our liquidity and cost of funds may be impacted by reputation risk, investor behavior and confidence, debt market disruption, firm specific concerns or prevailing market conditions .

Security holders of Bank of America Corporation could face significant or complete losses, such as security holders of the Corporation . Our credit portfolios may be impacted by macroeconomic and market conditions, events and disruptions .\n Recessionary environment and rise in unemployment could adversely impact ability of our consumer and/or commercial borrowers or counterparties to meet their financial obligations . Consumers have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by inflation and higher cost of living, resulting in drawdowns of savings or increases in household debt . Certain sectors also remain at risk as a result of shifts in demand and tight financial and credit conditions .\n If the macroeconomic environment or certain sectors worsen, our credit portfolio, net charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit losses could be adversely impacted .

We are also a member of various CCPs, which results in credit risk exposure to those CCPs .

Non-compliance, including improper implementation, and/or violations could result in an increase in operational and compliance costs, and enforcement actions and civil and criminal penalties .\n The Russia/Ukraine conflict and the conflicts in the Middle East have magnified such risks and resulted in regional instability .

Our inability to properly introduce, deploy and manage operational or technology changes and continuously alter, improve and automate processes and systems, including related controls, could also result in additional operational, information security and regulatory risk, including from the use of artificial intelligence .\n There can be no assurance that our resiliency, business continuity, technology change and information security response plans will effectively mitigate our operational risks . Backup systems or manual processes may not process data accurately and/or as quickly or effectively as our primary systems, and some data might not be available or backed up . The speed in which we are able to remediate any failure or disruption may vary across jurisdictions .\n We rely on effective access management and the secure collection, processing, maintenance, use, transmission, storage, dissemination and disposition of information in our and our third parties’ information systems .
