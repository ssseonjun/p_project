    "item1": "Item 1. \nBusiness\n\" for additional information regarding the definition of and other information regarding the non-GAAP measures we present in this Report.\n\n\nWe do not consider non-GAAP measures as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders.  The principal limitation of these non-GAAP measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition, they reflect the exercise of management's judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP measures.  In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided, including as set forth below.  Non-GAAP measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects.\n\n\nPro-rata Same Property NOI:\n\n\nPro-rata same property NOI,

increased by $26.3 million due to rent steps in existing leases, positive rental spreads on new and renewal leases, and increases in occupancy, as well as redevelopment projects completing and operating.\n\n\n•\nRecoveries from tenants increased by $9.0 million due to increases in recoverable expenses, expense recovery rates and increased occupancy.\n\n\n•\nTermination fees decreased by $3.0 million due to higher termination fees recognized in 2023 due to early tenant move outs.\n\n\n•\nUncollectible lease income adjustment decreased by $3.7 million primarily driven by favorable collections in 2023 of previously reserved amounts, reducing our adjustment in the comparable period.\n\n\n•\nOther lease income increased by $1.1 million primarily due to sustainability income and other fees.\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nOther property income increased by $1.5 million primarily due to business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2024.\n\n\nTotal real estate operating expenses increased by $6.4 million, on a net basis, as follows:\n\n\n•\nOperating and maintenance increased by $1.7 million primary due to increases in common area maintenance and other tenant-recoverable costs.\n\n\n•\nReal estate taxes increased by $4.2 million primary due to an increase in real estate assessments across the portfolio.\n\n\nReconciliation of Pro-rata Same Property

Resources\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nWe use cash flows generated from operating, investing, and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet, finance our development and redevelopment projects, fund our investment activities, and maintain financial flexibility.  A significant portion of our cash from operations is distributed to our common shareholders in the form of dividends in order to maintain our status as a REIT.\n\n\nExcept for $200 million of private placement debt, our Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership.  All remaining debt is held by our Operating Partnership, its subsidiaries, or by our real estate partnerships.  The Operating Partnership is a co-issuer and a guarantor of the $200 million of outstanding debt of our Parent Company.  The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe continually assess our available liquidity and our expected cash requirements, including monitoring our tenant rent collections.  We have access to and draw on multiple financing sources to fund our operations and our long-term capital needs, including the requirements of our in process and planned developments, redevelopments, other capital expenditures, and the repayment of debt.  We expect to meet these needs for the next 12 months and beyond by using a combination of the following: cash flow from operations after funding our common stock and preferred stock dividends, borrowings from our Line, proceeds from the sale of real estate, mortgage loan and unsecured bank financing, distributions received from our real estate partnerships, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity securities or the issuance of new unsecured debt.  We continually evaluate alternative financing options, and we believe we can obtain new financing on reasonable terms, although likely at higher interest rates than that of our debt currently outstanding, due to the current interest rate environment.\n\n\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOn January 8, 2024, we priced a public offering of $400 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2034 (the \"January 2024 Notes\") under our existing shelf registration statement filed with the SEC.  The January 2024 Notes were issued at 99.617% of par value with a coupon of 5.25%, and will mature on January 15, 2034.  Additionally, on August 12, 2024, we priced a public offering of $325 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2035 (the \"August 2024 Notes\") under our existing shelf registration statement filed with the SEC.  The August 2024 Notes were issued at 99.813% of par value with a coupon of 5.10%, and will mature on January 15, 2035.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe redeemed $250 million of senior unsecured notes that matured in June 2024, and our next maturity of senior unsecured notes occurs in November 2025.  We have $101.6 million of secured loan maturities during the next 12 months, including Regency's pro-rata share of maturities within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, which we intend to refinance or pay-off as they mature.  Based upon our available cash balance, sources of capital, our current credit ratings, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties we own, we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs for the next year, although, in the longer term, we can provide no assurances.\n\n\nIn addition to our $56.3 million of unrestricted cash, we have the following additional sources of capital available:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nATM program (see note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal offering amount\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n500,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable capacity \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n400,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine of Credit (see note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal commitment amount\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,500,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable capacity\n \n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,424,940\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaturity\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\nMarch 23, 2028\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nDuring November and December 2024, we entered into forward sale agreements with respect to 1,339,377 shares that were purchased in several tranches at a weighted average offering price of $74.66 per share before any underwriting discount and offering expenses.  These shares are pledged under forward sale agreements and must be settled within one year of their trade dates, which vary by agreement and are expected to result in net proceeds of approximately $100 million. After giving effect to this forward equity offering as of December 31, 2024, $400 million of common stock remains available for issuance under the ATM program authorized by the Company's Board of Directors, which is subject to change in the discretion of the Board. \n\n\n(2)\nNet of letters of credit issued against our Line.\n\n\n(3)\nThe Company has the option under its Line to extend the maturity for two additional six-month periods, subject to the terms of the Line.\n\n\nThe declaration of dividends is determined quarterly by our Board of Directors.  On February 4, 2025, our Board of Directors:\n\n\n•\nDeclared a common stock dividend of $0.705 per share, payable on April 2, 2025, to shareholders of record as of March 12, 2025;\n\n\n•\nDeclared a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock, which will be paid at a rate of $0.390625 per share on April 30, 2025. The dividend will be payable to holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock as of the close of business on April 15, 2025; and\n\n\n•\nDeclared a dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock, which will be paid at a rate of $0.367200 per share on April 30, 2025. The dividend will be payable to holders of record of the Series B Preferred Stock as of the close of business on April 15, 2025. \n\n\nWhile future dividends will be determined at the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders, that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions.  During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $790.2 million and $719.6 million, respectively, and paid $507.0 million and $458.8 million in dividends to our common and preferred stock and unit holders, in the same respective periods.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe currently have development and redevelopment projects in various stages of planning, design and construction, along with a pipeline of potential projects for future development or redevelopment.  After funding our common and preferred stock dividend payments in January 2025, we estimate that we will require capital during the next 12 months of approximately $544.9 million related to leasing commissions, tenant improvements, in-process developments and redevelopments, capital contributions to our real estate partnerships, and repaying maturing debt.  These capital requirements are being impacted by inflation resulting in increased costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third party contractors and suppliers.  In response, we have implemented mitigation strategies such as entering into fixed cost construction contracts, pre-ordering materials, and other planning efforts.  Further, continued challenges from permitting delays and labor and material shortages may extend the time to completion of these projects.\n\n\n \n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIf we start new developments or redevelopments, commit to property acquisitions, repay debt prior to maturity, declare future dividends, or repurchase shares of our common stock, our cash requirements will increase.  If we refinance maturing debt, our cash requirements will decrease.\n \n\n\nWe endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets. As of December 31, 2024, 88.6% of our wholly-owned real estate assets were unencumbered.  Our low level of encumbered assets allows us to more readily access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain borrowing capacity on the Line.\n\n\nOur Line and unsecured debt require that we remain in compliance with various financial covenants customary for debt of this type, which are described in Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024, and expect to remain in compliance.\n\n\nSummary of Cash Flow Activity\n\n\nThe following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating, investing, and financing activities of the Company:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n790,198\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n719,591\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n70,607\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(326,644\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(341,978\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15,334\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(493,024\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(355,035\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(137,989\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(29,470\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22,578\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(52,048\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n61,884\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n91,354\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(29,470\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities:\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities changed by $70.6 million due to:\n\n\n•\n$68.0 million increase in cash from operations due to the acquisition of UBP, and timing of receipts and payments\n\n\n•\n$2.6 million increase in operating cash flow distributions from Investments in real estate partnerships.\n\n\n \n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities:\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities changed by $15.3 million as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash flows from investing activities:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition of operating real estate\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(45,405\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(45,386\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(19\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition of UBP, net of cash acquired of $14,143\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(82,389\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n82,389\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal estate development and capital improvements\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(343,368\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(232,855\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(110,513\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from sale of real estate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n108,615\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,167\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n97,448\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from property insurance casualty claims\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,286\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,286\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssuance of notes receivable\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(32,651\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(4,000\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(28,651\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollection of notes receivable\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,115\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(885\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments in real estate partnerships\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(41,345\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(13,119\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(28,226\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn of capital from investments in real estate partnerships\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,034\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,308\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,726\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDividends on investment securities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n453\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,283\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(830\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition of investment securities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(101,044\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(7,990\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(93,054\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from sale of investment securities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n106,666\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16,003\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n90,663\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(326,644\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(341,978\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15,334\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant changes in investing activities include:\n\n\n•\nWe paid $45.4 million in 2024 to purchase one operating property.

The size and magnitude of each redevelopment project varies with each redevelopment plan.  The timing and duration of these projects could also result in volatility in NOI.  See the tables below for more details about our redevelopment projects.\n\n\n•\nDevelopment costs are higher in 2024 due to the progress towards completion of our development projects in process.  See the tables below for more details about our development projects. \n\n\n•\nInterest is capitalized on our development and redevelopment projects and is based on cumulative actual costs expended.  We cease interest capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond 12 months after the anchor tenant opens for business.  If we reduce our development and redevelopment activity, the amount of interest that we capitalize may be lower than historical averages.\n\n\n•\nWe have a staff of employees who directly manage and support our development and redevelopment program.  Internal compensation costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized as part of each project. \n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table summarizes our development projects in-process and completed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands, except cost PSF)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty Name\n\n\n \n\n\nMarket\n\n\n \n\n\nOwnership \n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\nStart Date\n\n\n \n\n\nEstimated Stabilization Year\n (1)\n\n\n \n\n\nEstimated / Actual Net\nDevelopment\nCosts\n (2) (3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGLA \n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCost PSF\nof GLA\n (2) (3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% of Costs\nIncurred\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopments In-Process\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaybrook East -

The 2024 period includes $10.7 million of these repurchases to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations related to the UBP acquisition. \n\n\n•\nDuring 2024, we paid $200.1 million to repurchase 3,306,709 shares of our common stock under our Repurchase Program, as compared to $20.0 million to repurchase 349,519 shares of our common stock during 2023.\n\n\n•\nDuring 2024, we received $6.8 million in contributions for the limited partners' share of development funding.  During 2023, we received $10.2 million of contributions from limited partners for their share of debt repayments and development funding.\n\n\n•\nDuring 2024, we distributed $12.2 million to limited partners, including proceeds to partially redeem a noncontrolling interest in one real estate partnership.  During 2023, we distributed $7.8 million in operating distributions.\n\n\n•\nWe paid $48.1 million more in dividends as a result of an increase in our dividend rate per share and the number of shares of our common stock outstanding, as well as preferred dividends which commenced in late 2023 as a result of the UBP acquisition.\n\n\n•\nWe had the following debt related activity during 2024:\n\n\no\nWe repaid $87.0 million in net proceeds from our Line,\n\n\no\nWe received $722.9 million in proceeds from issuing unsecured public debt\n\n\no\nWe received $12.0 million in proceeds from issuance of a mortgage loan\n\n\no\nWe paid $392.5 million for debt repayments, including:\n\n\n▪\n$250.0 million in unsecured public debt repayments,\n\n\n▪\n$131.3 million for repaying seven mortgage loans at maturity, and\n\n\n▪\n$11.2 million in principal mortgage payments.\n\n\no\nWe paid $16.7 million in loan costs relating to the recast of the Line as well as the unsecured public debt offerings.\n\n\n•\nWe had the following debt related activity during 2023:\n\n\no\nWe received $59.5 million in proceeds from issuance of a mortgage refinancing,\n\n\no\nWe paid $72.8 million for debt repayments, including:\n\n\n▪\n$11.2 million in principal mortgage payments, and \n\n\n▪\n$61.6 million for a combination of repaying or refinancing six mortgage loans at maturity.\n\n\n•\nWe paid $9.2 million in 2023 for the redemption of exchangable operating partnership units.\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\n \n\n\nWe have material obligations at December 31, 2024, which are discussed in our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and include:\n\n\n•\nMortgage loans, unsecured notes, and unsecured credit facilities as discussed in note 9, and related interest rate swaps as discussed in note 10;\n\n\n•\nWe have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center.  We also have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business.  These lease obligations are discussed in note 7;\n\n\n•\nOur share of mortgage loans within our Investments in real estate partnerships, as discussed in note 4;\n\n\n•\nLetters of credit of $10.9 million issued to cover our captive insurance program and performance obligations on certain development projects, the latter of which will be satisfied upon completion of the development projects;\n\n\n•\nObligations for retirement savings plans due to uncertainty around timing of participant withdrawals, which are solely within the control of the participant, and are further discussed in note 14; and\n\n\n•\nWe will also incur obligations related to construction or development contracts on projects in process; however, future amounts under these construction contracts are not due until future satisfactory performance under the contracts.\n\n\n \n\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\n\nKnowledge about our significant accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires that we make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of the financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during the financial reporting period. These accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions are based upon, but not limited to historical experience, current trends, expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards. While the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting estimates, the estimates discussed below are believed to be critical because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates. We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.\n\n\nImpairment of Real Estate Investments\n\n\nIn accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are events or changes in circumstances, including property operating performance, general market conditions or changes in expected hold periods, that indicate that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  If such events or changes occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, expected leasing activity, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, expected hold period, comparable sales information, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction.  If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value.\n \n\n\nThe estimated fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is estimated through comparable sales information and other market data if available, as well as the use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  The discounted cash flow method uses similar assumptions to the undiscounted cash flow method above, as well as a discount rate.  Such cash flow projections and rates are subject to management judgment and changes in those assumptions could impact the estimation of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.  Changes in events or changes in circumstances may alter the expected hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.\n \n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\nSee note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n\n\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, which primarily pertain to chemicals historically used by certain current and former dry cleaning and gas station tenants and the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers.  We believe that the relatively few tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations.  Generally, we endeavor to require tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems, in accordance with the terms of our leases.  We carry an environmental insurance policy for certain third-party liabilities and, in certain circumstances, remediation costs on shopping centers for currently unknown contamination.  We have also secured environmental insurance policies, where appropriate, on a relatively small number of specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk.  We monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites.  We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so.\n\n\nThe Company had accrued liabilities of  $17.3 million for environmental remediation, which are included in Accounts payable, and other liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024.  We believe that the ultimate remediation of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.  We can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental contamination; that our estimate of liabilities will not change as more information becomes available; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.\n\n\n \n\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualita\ntive Disclosures about Market Risk\n\n\nWe are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk:\n\n\n•\nUnder the Line, as further described in note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have a variable interest rate that, as of December 31, 2024, was based upon an annual rate of Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus a 0.10% market adjustment (\"Adjusted SOFR\") plus an applicable margin of 0.715%.  SOFR rates charged on our Line change monthly, and the applicable margin on the Line was dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings or leverage targets, as well as meeting specific sustainability target thresholds.  If our credit ratings were downgraded or if we fail to meet the leverage targets or sustainability target thresholds, the applicable margin on the Line would increase, resulting in higher interest costs.  As of December 31, 2024 the interest rate plus applicable margin based on our credit rating ranged from Adjusted SOFR plus 0.640% to Adjusted SOFR plus 1.390%.\n\n\n•\nWe are also exposed to changes in interest rates when we refinance our existing long-term fixed rate debt.  The objective of our interest rate risk management program is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows.  To achieve these objectives, we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument.  We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.  Our interest rate swaps are structured solely for the purpose of interest rate protection.\n\n\nWe continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt, to repay maturing debt, or to fund our commitments.  We continue to believe, in light of our credit ratings, the available capacity under our unsecured credit facility, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings, we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund maturing debt obligations.  It is uncertain the degree to which capital market volatility and higher interest rates will adversely impact the interest rates on any new debt that we may issue.\n\n\nThe table below presents the principal cash flows, weighted average interest rates of remaining debt, and the fair value of total debt as of December 31, 2024.  For variable rate mortgages and unsecured credit facilities for which we have interest rate swaps in place to fix the interest rate, they are included in the Fixed rate debt section below at their all-in fixed rate.  The table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.  Although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table, those rates represent rates that existed as of December 31, 2024, and are subject to change.  In addition, we continually assess the market risk for floating rate debt and believe that an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $0.7 million per year based on $74.6 million of floating rate mortgage debt and floating rate line of credit balances outstanding at December 31, 2024.\n \n\n\nFurther, the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2024, and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date or obligations repaid before maturity.  Since firm commitments are not presented, the table has limited predictive value.  As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time, and actual interest rates.\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe table below presents the principal cash flow payments associated with our outstanding debt by year, weighted average interest rates on debt outstanding at each year-end, and fair value of total debt as of December 31, 2024:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFair Value\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed rate debt \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n308,465\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n357,768\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n754,572\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n341,882\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n481,406\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,123,633\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,367,726\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,131,301\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage interest rate for all fixed rate debt\n (2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.09\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.11\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.13\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.25\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.23\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.47\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable rate SOFR debt \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,870\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n120\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n120\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n70,525\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n74,635\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n74,795\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage interest rate for all variable rate debt \n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.55\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.49\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.48\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.48\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nReflects amount of debt maturities during each of the years presented as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\n(2)\nReflects weighted average interest rates of debt outstanding at the end of each year presented.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 14, 2025\n expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\nEvaluation of expected hold periods for certain real estate assets\n\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and presented on the consolidated balance sheet, real estate assets, less accumulated depreciation was $10.7 billion as of December 31, 2024.  The Company evaluates real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) for impairment whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of the real estate properties may not be recoverable.\n\n\nWe identified the Company’s assessment of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate a shortened expected hold period for certain real estate properties as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the events or changes in circumstances assessed by the Company that could indicate shortened expected hold periods for certain real estate properties. A shortening of the expected hold period could indicate a potential impairment.\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of a control related to the Company’s assessment of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate shortened expected hold periods for certain real estate properties. To evaluate relevant events or changes in circumstances indicating a potential shortening of the expected holding period, we:\n\n\n•\ninquired of management and obtained written representations regarding potential property disposal plans, if any\n\n\n•\nread minutes of the meetings of the Company’s board of directors\n\n\n•\ninquired of the Company’s plans with those in the organization who are responsible for, and have authority over, potential disposition activities\n\n\n•\ncompared management’s assessment of properties with potential shortened expected hold periods to information obtained from those in the organization responsible for disposition activity\n\n\n•\ninspected listings from external sources of real estate properties for sale by the Company.\n\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1993.\n\n\nJacksonville, Florida\n\n\nFebruary 14, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\n\n\nRegency Centers Corporation:\n\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nWe have audited Regency Centers Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\n\nJacksonville, Florida\n\n\nFebruary 14, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\nTo the Board of Directors of Regency Centers Corporation\n\n\nand the Partners of Regency Centers, L.P.:\n\n\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regency Centers, L.P. and subsidiaries (the Partnership) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

Policies\n(a)\nOrganization and Principles of Consolidation\nGeneral\nRegency Centers Corporation (the \"Parent Company\") began its operations as a REIT in 1993 and is the general partner of Regency Centers, L.P. (the \"Operating Partnership\").  The Parent Company primarily engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, development, and redevelopment of shopping centers through the Operating Partnership and has no other assets other than through its investment in the Operating Partnership.  Its only indebtedness consists of $\n200\n million of unsecured private placement notes, which are co-issued and guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.  The Parent Company guarantees all of the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the \"Company\" or \"Regency\") owned \n379\n properties and held partial interests in an additional \n103\n properties through unconsolidated Investments in real estate partnerships (also referred to as \"joint ventures\" or \"investment partnerships\").\nAcquisition of Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc.\nOn \nAugust 18, 2023\n, the Company acquired Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. (\"UBP\") which was accounted for as an asset acquisition.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Urstadt Biddle common stock and Urstadt Biddle Class A common stock was converted into \n0.347\n of a share of common stock of the Parent Company.  Additionally, \neach share of UBP’s \n6.25\n% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and \n5.875\n% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock was converted into \none\n share of newly issued Parent Company \n6.25\n% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (\"Parent Company Series A preferred stock\") and \n5.875\n% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (\"Parent Company Series B preferred stock\"), respectively (collectively referred to as the \"Preferred Stock\").\nAs a result of the acquisition, the Company acquired \n74\n properties representing \n5.3\n million square feet of GLA, including \n10\n properties held through real estate partnerships.\nEstimates, Risks, and Uncert\nainties\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The most significant estimates in the Company's financial statements relate to the net carrying values of its real estate investments, collectibility of lease income, and acquired lease intangible assets and liabilities.  It is possible that the estimates and assumptions that have been utilized in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements could change significantly if economic conditions were to weaken\n.\nThe success of the Company's tenants in operating their businesses and their corresponding ability to pay rent continue to be influenced by current economic challenges, which may impact their cost of doing business, including but not limited to the impact of inflation, the cost and availability of labor, increasing energy prices and interest rates, and access to credit.  Additionally, geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges, including the war involving Russia and Ukraine, the current Middle East conflicts and wars, and economic conflicts with China, as well as the slowing of its economy, could impact aspects of the U.S. economy and, therefore, consumer spending.  The policies implemented by the U.S. government to address these and related issues, including changes by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of its benchmark federal funds rate, increases or decreases in federal government spending, and economic sanctions and tariffs, could result in adverse impacts on the U.S. economy, including a slowing of growth and potentially a recession, thereby impacting consumer spending, tenants' businesses, and/or decreasing future demand for space in shopping centers.  The potential impact of current macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is subject to change and continues to depend on the extent and duration of these risks and uncertainties.\n \n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nConsolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and consolidated partnerships in which the Company has a controlling financial interest.  Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company consolidates properties that are wholly-owned and properties where it owns less than 100% but holds a controlling financial interest in the entity.  Controlling financial interest is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\") and voting interest entities.  For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the entity where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nOwnership of the Parent Company\nThe Parent Company currently has a single class of common stock and two series of preferred stock outstanding.\nOwnership of the Operating Partnership\nThe Operating Partnership's capital includes Common Units and Preferred Units.  As of December 31, 2024, the Parent Company owned approximately \n99.4\n%\n or \n181,361,454\n of the \n182,458,113\n of the outstanding Common Units, with the remaining limited partner's Common Units held by third parties (\"Exchangeable operating partnership units\" or \"EOP units\").  The Parent Company currently owns all of the Preferred Units.\nEach EOP unit is exchangeable for cash or one share of common stock of the Parent Company, at the discretion of the Parent Company, and the unit holder cannot require redemption in cash or common stock (i.e., registered shares of the Parent).  The Parent Company has evaluated the conditions as specified under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 480, \nDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity\n, as it relates to EOP units outstanding and concluded that the Parent Company has the right to satisfy the redemption requirements of the units by delivering shares of unregistered common stock.  Accordingly, the Parent Company classifies EOP units as permanent equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity and Comprehensive Income.  The Parent Company serves as general partner of the Operating Partnership. The EOP unit holders have limited rights over the Operating Partnership such that they do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Operating Partnership’s economic performance.  As such, the Operating Partnership is considered a VIE, and the Parent Company, which consolidates it, is the primary beneficiary.  The Parent Company's only investment is the Operating Partnership. Net income and distributions of the Operating Partnership are allocable to the general and limited common Partnership Units in accordance with their ownership percentages.\nReal Estate Partnerships\nAs of December 31, 2024, Regency held partial ownership interests in \n122\n properties through real estate partnerships, of which \n19\n are consolidated.  Regency's partners include institutional investors, real estate developers and/or operators, and passive investors (the \"Partners\" or \"Limited Partners\").  These partnerships have been established to own and operate real estate properties.  The Company’s involvement with these entities is through its ownership of its equity interest in the partnerships and management of the properties.  The entities were deemed VIEs primarily because the unrelated investors do not have substantive kick-out rights to remove the general or managing partner by a vote of a simple majority or less, and they do not have substantive participating rights.  Regency has variable interests in these entities through its equity ownership, with Regency being the primary beneficiary in certain of these real estate partnerships.  Regency consolidates the partnerships into its financial statements for which it is the primary beneficiary and reports the limited partners' interests as noncontrolling interests.  For those partnerships which Regency is not the primary beneficiary and does not have a controlling financial interest, but has significant influence, Regency recognizes its equity investments in them in accordance with the equity method of accounting.\n\n\n83\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nThe assets of these partnerships are restricted to use by the respective partnerships and cannot be directly reached by general creditors of the Company, except to the extent that the Company has provided payment guarantees. Similarly, the obligations of the partnerships are backed by, and can only be settled through the assets of these partnerships or by additional capital contributions by the partners, or, where applicable, by the Company under such guarantees.  As managing member, Regency maintains the books and records and typically provides leasing property and asset management services to the partnerships.  The Partners' level of involvement in these partnerships varies from protective decisions (debt, bankruptcy, selling primary asset(s) of business) to participating involvement such as approving leases, operating budgets, and capital budgets.\n \n \n•\nCertain partnerships were deemed VIEs primarily because the unrelated investors do not have substantive kick-out rights to remove the general or managing partner by a vote of a simple majority or less, and they do not have substantive participating rights. Those partnerships for which the Partners are involved in the day to day decisions and do not have any other aspects that would cause them to be considered VIEs, are evaluated for consolidation using the voting interest model.\no\nThose partnerships in which Regency does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and Regency's ownership interest is recognized through single-line presentation as Investments in real estate partnerships, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and Equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Cash distributions of earnings from operations from Investments in real estate partnerships are presented in Cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Cash distributions from the sale of a property or loan proceeds received from the placement of debt on a property included in Investments in real estate partnerships are presented in Cash flows provided by investing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  If distributed proceeds from debt refinancing and real estate sales in excess of Regency's carrying value of its investment results in a negative investment balance for a partnership, it is recorded within Accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  \nThe net difference in the carrying amount of investments in real estate partnerships and the underlying equity in net assets is accreted to earnings and recorded in Equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations over the expected useful lives of the properties and other intangible assets, which range from \n10\n to \n40 years\n.\nThe majority of the operations of the VIEs are funded with cash flows generated by the properties, or in the case of developments, with capital contributions or third-party construction loans.\n \nThe carrying amounts of VIEs' assets and liabilities included in the Company's consolidated financial statements, exclusive of the Operating Partnership, are as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal estate assets, net\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n312,873\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n270,674\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16,687\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,201\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTenant and other receivables, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,833\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,883\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred costs, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,178\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,494\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquired lease intangible assets, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,293\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,099\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight of use assets, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18,148\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44,377\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n597\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n893\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n363,609\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n342,621\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes payable\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n32,653\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33,211\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounts payable and other liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16,149\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29,919\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquired lease intangible liabilities, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,627\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21,456\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTenants' security, escrow deposits and prepaid rent\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,260\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,239\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19,370\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21,433\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n80,059\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n107,258\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nNoncontrolling Interests\nThe Company accounts for noncontrolling interests in accordance with the Consolidation guidance and the Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity guidance issued by the FASB. Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of equity that the Company does not own in those entities it consolidates. Noncontrolling interests also include amounts related to partnership units issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the Company in connection with certain property acquisitions. These partnership units have a defined redemption amount and the unit holders generally have the right to redeem their units at any time after a certain period from issuance. For these partnership units, the Company has the option to settle redemption amounts in cash or common stock. The Company evaluates the terms of the partnership units issued in accordance with the FASB’s Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity guidance. The partnership units for which the Company has the option to settle redemption amounts in cash or common stock are included in the caption Noncontrolling interests within the equity section on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNoncontrolling Interests of the Parent Company\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company include the following ownership interests held by owners other than the common shareholders of the Parent Company: (i) the EOP units and (ii) the minority-owned interest held by third parties in consolidated partnerships (\"Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships\").  The Parent Company has included all of these noncontrolling interests in permanent equity, separate from the Parent Company's shareholders' equity, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity.  The portion of net income or comprehensive income attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in net income and comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income of the Parent Company.\nThe Parent Company also evaluated its fiduciary duties to itself, its shareholders, and, as the managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, to the Operating Partnership, and concluded its fiduciary duties are not in conflict with each other or the underlying agreements.  Therefore, the Parent Company classifies such units and interests as permanent equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity.\nNoncontrolling Interests of the Operating Partnership\nThe Operating Partnership has determined that limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are noncontrolling interests.  Subject to certain conditions and pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements, the Company generally has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the other members' interest or sell its own interest in these consolidated partnerships.  The Operating Partnership has included these noncontrolling interests in permanent capital, separate from partners' capital, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Capital.  The portion of net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in Net income and Comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements Comprehensive Income of the Operating Partnership.\n(b)\nRevenues and Tenant Receivable\nLeasing Income and Tenant Receivables\nThe Company leases space to tenants under agreements with varying terms that generally provide for fixed payments of base rent, with stated increases over the term of the lease.  Some of the lease agreements contain provisions that provide for additional rents based on tenants' sales volume (\"percentage rent\"), which are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements.  Additionally, most lease agreements contain provisions for reimbursement of the tenants' share of actual real estate taxes and insurance and common area maintenance (\"CAM\") costs (collectively \"Recoverable Costs\") incurred.\nLease terms generally range from \nthree\n to \nseven years\n for tenant spaces under \n10,000\n square feet (\"Shop Space\") and in excess of \nfive years\n for spaces greater than \n10,000\n square feet (\"Anchor Space\").  Many leases also provide tenants the option to extend their lease beyond the initial term of the lease.  If a tenant does not exercise its option or otherwise negotiate to renew, the lease expires and the lease contains an obligation for the tenant to relinquish its space, allowing it to be re-leased to a new tenant.  This generally involves some level of cost to prepare the space for re-leasing, which is capitalized and depreciated over the shorter period of the life of the subsequent lease or the useful life of the improvement.\n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nThe Company accounts for its leases under ASC Topic 842, \nLeases \n(\"Topic 842\"), as follows:\nClassification\nUnder Topic 842, new leases or modifications thereto must be evaluated against specific classification criteria, which, based on the customary terms of the Company's leases, are classified as operating leases.  However, certain longer-term leases (both lessee and lessor leases) may be classified as direct financing or sales type leases, which may result in selling profit and an accelerated pattern of earnings recognition.  At December 31, 2024, the Company classified three leases as sales type leases, with all others classified as operating leases.\nRecognition and Presentation\nLease income for operating leases with fixed payment terms is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease for all leases for which collectibility is considered probable.  CAM is considered a non-lease component of the lease contract under Topic 842.  However, as the timing and pattern of providing the CAM service to the tenant is the same as the timing and pattern of the tenant's use of the underlying lease asset, the Company elected, as part of an available practical expedient, to combine CAM with the remaining lease components, along with tenant's reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance, and recognize them together as Lease income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor sales type leases, the Company records any selling profit or loss arising from the lease at inception within Gain on sale of real estate, net of tax in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations, as well as any initial direct costs recorded as an expense if, at commencement, the fair value of the underlying asset differs from its carrying amount, otherwise, they are deferred and included in the net investment in the lease.  The net investment in the sales-type lease represents the lease receivable, the components of which are the future lease payments and any guaranteed residual value for the underlying assets, as well as any unguaranteed residual asset expected at the end of the lease term, each measured at net present value discounted using a rate implicit in the lease.  Interest income is recorded within Lease income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the Company’s net investment in the leases.  At the commencement date, the Company derecognizes the carrying amount of the underlying asset.  When measuring the net investment in a long-term ground lease, the undiscounted residual value of the land will be limited to its fair value at commencement which will likely equate to its cost.\nCollectibility\nAt lease commencement, the Company generally expects that collectibility of substantially all payments due under the lease is probable due to the Company's credit checks on tenants and other creditworthiness analysis undertaken before entering into a new lease; therefore, income from most operating leases is initially recognized on a straight-line basis.  For operating leases in which collectibility of Lease income is not considered probable, Lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized straight-line rent receivables are reversed in the period in which the Lease income is determined not to be probable of collection.  Should collectibility of Lease income become probable again, through evaluation of qualitative and quantitative measures on a tenant by tenant basis, accrual basis accounting resumes and all commencement-to-date straight-line rent is recognized in that period.\n \nIn addition to the lease-specific collectibility assessment performed under Topic 842, the Company may also recognize a general reserve, as a reduction to Lease income, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the Company's historical collection experience.  The Company estimates the collectibility of the accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rents, recoveries from tenants, and other revenue taking into consideration the Company's historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and remaining lease terms.  Uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against Lease income.  Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.\n\n\n86\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nThe following table represents the components of Tenant and other receivables, net of amounts considered uncollectible, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTenant receivables\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n35,306\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34,814\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStraight-line rent receivables\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n157,507\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n138,590\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther receivables \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62,682\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32,758\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal tenant and other receivables, net\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n255,495\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n206,162\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOther receivables include notes receivables, construction receivables, insurance receivables, and amounts due from real estate partnerships for Management, transaction and other fee income.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has an outstanding note receivable in the carrying amount of \n$\n29.8\n million\n at an interest rate of \n6.8\n% maturing in January 2027, secured by a grocery-anchored shopping center.\nReal Estate Sales\n \nThe Company accounts for sales of nonfinancial assets under ASC Subtopic 610-20, \nOther Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\n, whereby the Company derecognizes real estate and recognizes a gain or loss on sales when a contract exists and control of the property has transferred to the buyer.  Control of the property, including controlling financial interest, is generally considered to transfer upon closing through transfer of the legal title and possession of the property.  While generally rare, any retained noncontrolling interest is measured at fair value at that time.\nManagement Services and Other Property Income\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC Topic 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers \n(\"Topic 606\")\n, \nwhen or as control of the promised services are transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.  The following is a description of the Company's revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of Topic 606.\nProperty and Asset Management Services\nThe Company is engaged under agreements with its joint venture partnerships, which are generally perpetual in nature and cancellable through unanimous partner approval, absent an event of default.  Under these agreements, the Company is to provide asset and property management and leasing services for the joint ventures' shopping centers.  The fees are market-based, generally calculated as a percentage of either revenues earned or the estimated values of the properties managed or the proceeds received, and are recognized over the monthly or quarterly periods as services are rendered.  Property management and asset management services represent a series of distinct daily services.  Accordingly, the Company satisfies its performance obligation as service is rendered each day and the variability associated with that compensation is resolved each day.  Amounts due from the partnerships for such services are paid during the month following the monthly or quarterly service periods.\nSeveral of the Company's partnership agreements provide for incentive payments, generally referred to as \"promotes\" or \"earnouts,\" to Regency for appreciation in property values in Regency's capacity as managing member.  The terms of these promotes are based on appreciation in real estate value over designated time intervals or upon designated events.  The Company evaluates its expected promote payout at each reporting period, which generally does not result in revenue recognition until the measurement period has completed, when the amount can be reasonably determined and the amount is not probable of significant reversal.\n \nLeasing Services\nLeasing service fees are based on a percentage of the total rent due under the lease.  The leasing service is considered performed upon successful execution of an acceptable tenant lease for the joint ventures' shopping centers, at which time revenue is recognized.

Control of these services is generally transferred at the time the related transaction closes, which is the point in time when the Company recognizes the related fee revenue.  Any unpaid amounts related to transaction-based fees are included in Tenant and other receivables within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \nOther Property Income\nOther property income includes parking fees and other incidental income from the properties and is generally recognized at the point in time that the performance obligation is met.\n \nIncome within Management, transaction, and other fees is primarily derived from contracts with the Company's real estate partnerships.  \nThe primary components of these revenue streams, the timing of satisfying the performance obligations, and amounts are as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\nTiming of\nsatisfaction of\nperformance\nobligations\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement, transaction, and other fees:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty management services\n\n\n \n\n\nOver time\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,767\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,075\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,470\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset management services\n\n\n \n\n\nOver time\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,548\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,542\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,752\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeasing services\n\n\n \n\n\nPoint in time\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,738\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,908\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,945\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther transaction fees\n\n\n \n\n\nPoint in time\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,821\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,429\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,684\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n             Total management, transaction, and other fees\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n27,874\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n26,954\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25,851\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe accounts receivable for Total management, transactions, and other fees, which are included within Tenant and other receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, are $\n19.7\n million\n and $\n18.5\n million\n, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\n, respectively.\n \n(c)\nReal Estate Assets\nThe following table details the components of Real estate assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,757,704\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,802,583\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand improvements\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n807,881\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n758,779\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuildings\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,456,719\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,371,894\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding and tenant improvements\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,461,003\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,302,954\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction in progress\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n215,112\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n218,181\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal real estate assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n13,698,419\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,454,391\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCapitalization and Depreciation\nReal estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, and amortization. The Company periodically assesses the useful lives of its depreciable real estate assets, including those intended to be redeveloped in the near term, and accounts for any revisions prospectively. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and demolition costs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized.\nAs part of the leasing process, the Company may provide lessees with allowances for the construction of leasehold improvements.  These leasehold improvements are capitalized and recorded as tenant improvements and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the remaining lease term.  If the allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event the Company is not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease term as a reduction of Lease income.  Factors considered during this evaluation include, among other things, who holds legal title to the improvements as well as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement and provisions for substantiation of such costs (e.g. unilateral control of the tenant space during the build-out process).  Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease.\n\n\n88\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of approximately \n15\n years for land improvements, \n40\n years for buildings and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term.\nDevelopment and Redevelopment Costs\nAll specifically identifiable costs related to development and redevelopment activities are capitalized into Real estate assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are included in Construction in progress within the above table.  The capitalized costs include pre-development costs essential to the development or redevelopment of the property, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, insurance, legal costs, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development or redevelopment.\n \nPre-development costs represent the costs the Company incurs prior to land acquisition or pursuing a redevelopment including contract deposits, as well as legal, engineering, and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing or redeveloping a shopping center.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had nonrefundable deposits and other pre-development costs of approximately \n$\n10.2\n million\n and \n$\n7.7\n million\n, respectively.  If the Company determines that the development or redevelopment of a particular shopping center is no longer probable, any related pre-development costs previously capitalized are immediately expensed.  During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company expensed pre-development costs of approximately \n$\n0.9\n million\n, \n$\n0.1\n million\n, and \n$\n0.6\n million\n, respectively, in Other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest costs are capitalized into each development and redevelopment project based upon applying the Company's weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development or redevelopment costs incurred.  The Company discontinues interest and real estate tax capitalization when a project is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would the Company capitalize interest on a project beyond \n12\n months after substantial comple\ntion of the building.  During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company capitalized interest of \n$\n6.6\n million\n, \n$\n5.7\n million\n, and \n$\n4.2\n million\n, respectively, on our development and redevelopment projects.\n \nWe have a staff of employees directly supporting our development and redevelopment program.  All direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development and redevelopment project.  The capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring.  During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we capitalized \n$\n19.8\n million\n, \n$\n13.3\n million\n, and \n$\n10.8\n million\n, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development and redevelopment program.\n \nAcquisitions\n \nUpon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, land improvements, buildings, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date.  Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price of the acquired properties based on their relative fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities.  Acquisitions of operating properties are generally considered asset acquisitions and therefore transaction costs are capitalized.  Fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n \nThe Company's methodology includes estimating an \"as-if vacant\" fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements.  In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases.\nThe value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period.  The value of in-place leases is recorded to Depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining expected term of the respective leases.\n \nAbove-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.  The value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of below-market leases is accreted to Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nThe Company does not assign value to customer\n \nrelationship intangibles if it has pre-existing business relationships with major retailers at the acquired property since they do not provide incremental value over the Company's existing relationships.\nHeld for Sale\nThe Company classifies real estate assets as held-for-sale upon satisfaction of all the following criteria: (i) management commits to a plan to sell a property (or group of properties), (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such properties, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the property have been initiated, (iv) the sale of the property is probable and transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year, (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale, and (vi) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.  Upon the determination to classify a property as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation and amortization on the real estate property held for sale, as well as the amortization of any related intangible assets. Such properties are recorded at the lesser of the carrying value or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nValuation of Real Estate Investments and Impairments\nThe Company continually evaluates whether there are any events or changes in circumstances, that could indicate the carrying values of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate assets may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of the asset group by estimating whether the Company will recover the carrying value of the asset group through its undiscounted future cash flows, including eventual disposition. Based on this analysis, if the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of the asset group, an impairment charge will be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset group.\nEstimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, expected leasing activity, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, expected hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results.  Changes in events or changes in circumstances may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.  If a property previously classified as held and used is changed to held for sale, the Company estimates fair value, less expected costs to sell, which could cause the Company to determine that the property is impaired.\nThe estimated fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is estimated through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  The discounted cash flow approach uses similar assumptions to the undiscounted cash flow approach above, as well as a discount rate.  Such cash flow projections and rates are subject to management judgment and changes in those assumptions could impact the estimate of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, the Company generally uses market data and comparable sales information.\n(d)\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nAny instruments which have\n an original maturity of \n90 days or less\n when purchased are considered cash equivalents.  As of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, \n$\n5.6\n million\n and \n$\n6.4\n million\n, respectively, of cash was restricted through escrow agreements and certain mortgage loans.\n(e)\nOther Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price consideration from the Equity One merger in 2017 over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350, \nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\n, and allocates its goodwill to its reporting units, which have been determined to be at the individual property level.  The Company performs an impairment evaluation of its goodwill at least annually, in November of each year, or more frequently as triggers occur.  See Note 5.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation is completed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach.  Under a qualitative approach, the impairment review for goodwill consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, including goodwill.  If a qualitative approach indicates it is more\n \n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nlikely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit (including goodwill) exceeds its fair value, or if the Company chooses to bypass the qualitative approach for any reporting unit, the Company will perform the quantitative approach described below.\nThe quantitative approach consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted projected future cash flows and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values, which include the allocated goodwill.  If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company would then recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nInvestments\nThe Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date.  The fair value of securities is determined using quoted market prices.\nDebt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.  Debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized through earnings in Net investment (income) loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Debt securities not classified as held to maturity or as trading, are classified as available-for-sale, and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income and presented within Net investment (income) loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative instruments.  Specifically, the Company enters into derivative instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company's derivative instruments are used to manage fluctuations in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company's borrowings.\nAll derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.  Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.  Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.  The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or forecasted transaction, and the Company designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges generally involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  The Company may also utilize cash flow hedges to lock U.S. Treasury rates in anticipation of future fixed-rate debt issuances.  The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\").  Upon the settlement of a hedge, gains and losses remaining in AOCI are amortized through earnings over the underlying term of the hedged transaction.  The cash receipts or payments related to interest rate swaps are presented in cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n\n91\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nThe Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions.  The Company assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows and/or forecasted cash flows of the hedged items.\nIn assessing the valuation of the hedges, the Company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination costs at each balance sheet date.  All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.\n(f)\nDeferred Leasing Costs\nDeferred leasing costs consist of costs associated with leasing the Company's shopping centers, and are presented net of accumulated amortization.  Such costs are amortized over the period through lease expiration.  If the lease is terminated early, the remaining leasing costs are written off.\n \nUnder ASC Topic 842, the Company, as a lessor, may only defer as initial direct costs the incremental costs of a tenant's operating lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained.  These costs generally consist of third party broker payments.  Non-contingent internal leasing and legal costs associated with leasing activities are expensed within General and administrative expenses.\n \n(g)\nIncome Taxes\nThe Parent Company believes it qualifies, and intends to continue to qualify, as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, the Parent Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its shareholders are at least equal to REIT taxable income.  All wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be a TRS or qualify as a REIT.  The TRSs are subject to federal and state income taxes and file separate tax returns.  As a pass through entity, the Operating Partnership generally does not pay taxes, but its taxable income or loss is reported by its partners, of which the Parent Company, as general partner and approximately \n99.4\n%\n owner, is allocated its Pro-rata share of tax attributes.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes related to its TRSs under the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in\n \neffect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The Company records deferred tax liabilities within Accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized within Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is believed that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future taxable income, the reversal of other existing temporary differences, available net operating loss carryforwards, tax planning strategies and recent and projected results of operations in order to make that determination.\nIn addition, tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.  Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.  The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years (2021\n and forward for federal and state) based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.\n \n(h)\nLease Obligations\nThe Company has certain properties within its consolidated real estate portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties, which are all classified as operating leases.  Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold or similar interest in these properties.  The building and improvements constructed on the leased land are capitalized as Real estate assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\n\n\n92\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nIn addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which it conducts its business.   Leasehold improvements are capitalized as tenant improvements, presented in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\nUnder Topic 842, the Company recognizes Lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for its ground and office leases and corresponding Right of use assets related to these same ground and office leases which are classified as operating leases.  A key input in estimating the Lease liabilities and resulting Right of use assets is establishing the discount rate in the lease, which since the rates implicit in the lease contracts are not readily determinable, requires additional inputs for the longer-term ground leases, including market-based interest rates that correspond with the remaining term of the lease, the Company's credit spread, and a securitization adjustment necessary to reflect the collateralized payment terms present in the lease.  This discount rate is applied to the remaining unpaid minimum rental payments for each lease to measure the operating lease liabilities.\nThe ground and office lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases, including management's estimate of expected optional renewal periods.  For ground leases, the Company generally assumes it will exercise options through the latest option date of that shopping center's anchor tenant lease.\n \n(i)\nForward Equity Sales \nOur at-the-market (“ATM”) program allows for the sale of common stock through forward sales contracts. These contracts meet all conditions for equity classification, and as such, common stock is recorded at the offering price specified in the contract upon settlement. The Company also accounts for the potential dilution from forward sales contracts in the earnings per share calculations, using the treasury stock method to determine any dilutive impact before settlement. For further details on forward equity sales transactions, refer to Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements.\n \n(j)\nEarnings per Share and Unit\nBasic earnings per share of common stock and unit are computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and units, respectively, outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share and unit reflect the conversion of obligations and the assumed exercises of securities including the effects of shares issuable under the Company's share-based payment arrangements, if dilutive.  Dividends paid on the Company's share-based compensation awards are not participating securities as they are forfeitable.\n(k)\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees and directors and recognizes the cost of stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award, which is expensed over the vesting period.\nWhen the Parent Company issues common stock as compensation, it simultaneously receives an equal number of common units from the Operating Partnership.  The Company contributes all deemed proceeds from the share-based awards granted under the Parent Company's Long-Term Omnibus Plan (the \"Plan\") to the operating partnership.  Consequently, the Parent Company's ownership in the Operating Partnership increases in proportion to the deemed proceeds contributed in exchange for the common units received.  As a result of the issuance of common units to the Parent Company for stock-based compensation, the Operating Partnership records the effect of stock-based compensation for awards of equity in the Parent Company.\n(l)\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company's business is investing in retail shopping centers through direct ownership or partnership interests.  The Company actively manages its portfolio of retail shopping centers and may from time to time make decisions to sell lower performing properties or developments not meeting its long-term investment objectives.  The proceeds from sales are generally reinvested into higher quality retail shopping centers, through acquisitions, new developments, or redevelopment of existing centers, which management believes will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns.  It is management's intent that all retail shopping centers will be owned or developed for investment purposes; however, the  Company may decide to\n \nsell all or a portion of a development upon completion.  The Company's revenues and net income are generated from the operation of its investment portfolio.  The Company also earns fees for services provided to manage and lease retail shopping centers owned through joint ventures.\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nThe Company's portfolio is located throughout the United States.  Management does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of allocating resources or capital.  The Company’s chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") evaluates operating and financial performance for each property on an individual property level; therefore, the Company defines an operating segment as its individual properties.  The individual properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment based upon their similarities with regard to both the nature and economics of the centers, tenants and operational processes, as well as long-term average financial performance. For further details on segment information, refer to Note 16 in the consolidated financial statements.\n(m)\nInvestment Risk Concentrations\nNo single tenant comprised 10% or more of our aggregate annualized base rent (\"ABR\").  As of December 31, 2024, the Company had three geographic concentrations that individually accounted for at least 10.0% of its aggregate ABR.  Real estate properties located in California, Florida and New York-Newark-Jersey City core-based statistical area accounted for \n23.4\n%\n, \n20.5\n%\n and \n12.3\n%\n of ABR, respectively. As the result, this geographic concentration of our portfolio makes it potentially more susceptible to adverse weather, natural disasters or economic events that impact these locations. \nNone\n of the shopping centers are located outside the United States.\n(n)\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is intended to be a market-based measurement, as opposed to a transaction-specific measurement. Fair value is defined by ASC 820 as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Therefore, a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n•\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n•\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the Company's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.\nThe Company also re-measures nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, at fair value in subsequent periods if a re-measurement event occurs.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n94\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(n)\tRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements and expected impact on our financial statements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription\n\n\n \n\n\nDate of adoption\n\n\n \n\n\nEffect on the financial statements or other significant matters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently \nadopted\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nASU 2023-09\n,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\n\n\n \n\n\nASU 2023-09 requires public business entities to disclose additional information in specified categories with respect to the reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory rate for federal, state, and foreign income taxes.

This methodology includes estimating an \"as-if vacant\" fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements and also determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases.  The fair market value of the acquired operating properties is based on a valuation prepared by Regency with assistance of a third-party valuation specialist.  The third-party specialist utilized stabilized NOI and market specific capitalization rates as the primary valuation inputs in determining the fair value of the real estate assets. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. Management reviews the inputs used by the third-party specialist as well as the allocation of the purchase price to ensure reasonableness and that the procedures are performed in accordance with management's policy.  Management and the third-party valuation specialist prepared their fair value estimates for each of the operating properties acquired.  The allocation of the purchase price described above requires a significant amount of judgment and represents management's best estimate of the fair value as of the acquisition date.\n

Refinancing debt at maturity in the current interest rate environment could result in higher interest expense in future periods if rates remain elevated.  The Company is obligated to contribute its Pro-rata share to fund maturities if the loans are not refinanced, and it has the capacity to do so from existing cash balances, availability on its line of credit, and operating cash flows.  The Company believes that its partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements.  In the event that a real estate partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the real estate partnership, the Company would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call which would be secured by the partner's membership interest.\n \nManagement fee income\nIn addition to earning our share of net income or loss in each of these real estate partnerships, we receive fees as discussed in Note 1, as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset management, property management, leasing, and investment and financing services\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n27,874\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n26,954\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25,851\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.\nOther Assets\nThe following table represents the components of Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the periods set forth below:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodwill\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n166,739\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n167,062\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51,820\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51,992\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepaid and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n40,240\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n40,635\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,781\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,213\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurniture, fixtures, and equipment, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,954\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,662\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred financing costs, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9,512\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,865\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal other assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n289,046\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n283,429\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe following table presents the goodwill balances and activity during the year ended:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\nGoodwill\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAccumulated\nImpairment\nLosses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGoodwill\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAccumulated\nImpairment\nLosses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning of year balance\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n294,524\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n127,462\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n167,062\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n300,496\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n133,434\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n167,062\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodwill allocated to Properties held for sale\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n5,972\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,972\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodwill associated with disposed reporting units:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodwill allocated to Gain on sale of real estate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1,884\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,561\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n323\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of year balance\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n292,640\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n125,901\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n166,739\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n294,524\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n127,462\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n167,062\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAs the Company identifies properties (\"reporting units\") that no longer meet its investment criteria, it will evaluate the property for potential sale.

The Company's Lease income is comprised of both fixed and variable income.  Fixed and in-substance fixed lease income includes stated amounts per lease contracts, which are primarily related to base rent, and in some cases stated amounts for Recoverable Costs.  Income for these amounts is recognized on a straight-line basis.\nVariable lease income includes the following two main items in the lease contracts:\n(i)\nRecoveries from tenants represent the tenants' contractual obligations to reimburse the Company for their portion of Recoverable Costs incurred.  Generally, the Company's leases provide for the tenants to reimburse the Company based on the tenants' share of the actual costs incurred in proportion to the tenants' share of leased space in the property.\n(ii)\nPercentage rent represents amounts billable to tenants based on the tenants' actual sales volume in excess of levels specified in the lease contract.\nThe following table provides a disaggregation of lease income recognized as either fixed or variable lease income based on the criteria specified in Topic 842:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating lease income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed and in-substance fixed lease income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,035,225\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n928,364\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n851,409\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable lease income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n356,520\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n324,037\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n287,149\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther lease related income, net:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove/below market rent and tenant rent inducement amortization, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,843\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30,826\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22,543\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncollectible straight-line rent\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1,885\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,261\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,510\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncollectible amounts billable in lease income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n3,324\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n549\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,841\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal lease income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,411,379\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,283,939\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,187,452\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFuture minimum rental revenue under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding variable lease payments as of December 31, 2024, are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the year ending December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,021,232\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n942,040\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n825,189\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n676,595\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n536,477\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,006,865\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,008,398\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had three leases classified as sales-type leases, with lease income recorded over the lease term in the form of variable interest income representing the constant periodic rate of return on the Company’s net investment in the lease, and fixed contractual obligations.\nLessee Accounting\nThe Company has shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable, long-term ground leases where a third party owns the underlying land and has leased the land to the Company to construct and/or operate a shopping center.\nThe Company has \n20\n properties within its consolidated real estate portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties.  Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold or similar interest in these properties.  These ground leases expire through the year \n2121\n, and in most cases, provide for renewal options.\n \nIn addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases for office space used to conduct its business.  Office leases expire through the year \n2035\n, and in certain cases, provide for renewal options.\n \nThe ground and office lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases, including management's estimate of expected optional renewal periods, with ground lease expense presented within Property operating expense, and office lease expense presented within General and administrative in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \nOperating lease expense under the Company's ground and office leases were as follows, including straight-line rent

These fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe Company develops its judgments based on the best information available at the measurement date, including expected cash flows, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates, and available observable and unobservable inputs.  Service providers involved in fair value measurements are evaluated for competency and qualifications on an ongoing basis.  As considerable judgment is often necessary to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments, the fair values presented above are not necessarily indicative of amounts that will be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.\n\n\n108\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\n(b)\nFair Value Measurements\nThe following financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nSecurities\nThe Company has investments in marketable securities that are included within Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of the securities was determined using quoted prices in active markets, which are considered Level 1 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Changes in the value of securities are recorded within Net investment (income) loss in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, and include unrealized gains of \n$\n4.5\n million\n for the year ended December 31, 2024, unrealized gains of \n$\n4.2\n million\n for the year ended December 31, 2023 and unrealized losses of \n$\n8.0\n million\n for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities consist of investments in corporate bonds, and are recorded at fair value using either recent trade prices for the identical debt instrument or comparable instruments by issuers of similar industry sector, issuer rating, and size, to estimate fair value, which are considered Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Unrealized gains or losses on these debt securities are recognized through Other comprehensive income.\nInterest Rate Derivatives\nThe fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.\nAlthough the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.  The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate swaps.  As a result, the Company determined that its interest rate swaps valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following tables present the placement in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\nBalance\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets \n(Level 1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs \n(Level 2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs \n(Level 3)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n39,419\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39,419\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,401\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,401\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest rate derivatives\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,781\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,781\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n64,601\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39,419\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25,182\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiabilities:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest rate derivatives\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n423\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n423\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n109\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\nBalance\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets \n(Level 1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs \n(Level 2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs \n(Level 3)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n37,039\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37,039\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,953\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,953\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest rate derivatives\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,213\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,213\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n66,205\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37,039\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29,166\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiabilities:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest rate derivatives\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n1,335\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1,335\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThe following tables present the placement in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\nBalance\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets \n(Level 1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSignificant Other Observable Inputs \n(Level 2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs \n(Level 3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal Gains (Losses)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal estate assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10,915\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,915\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n12,974\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a \n$\n14.3\n million\n Provision for impairment on two operating properties.

The Plan allows the Company to issue up\n to \n5.0\n million shares in the form of the Parent Company's common stock or stock options.  As of \nDecember 31, 2024, there were \n3.8\n million shares available for grant under the Plan.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company grants restricted stock under the Plan to its employees as a form of long-term compensation and retention.  The terms of each restricted stock grant vary depending upon the participant's responsibilities and position within the Company.  The Company's stock grants can be categorized as either time-based awards, performance-based awards, or market-based awards.  All awards are valued at grant date fair value, earn dividends throughout the vesting period, and have no voting rights.  Fair value is measured using the grant date market price for all time-based and performance-based awards.  Market based awards are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value based on the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the projected stock price at the time of payout, discounted to the valuation date over a three year performance period.  Assumptions used in the estimate include historic volatility over the previous three year period, risk-free interest rates, and Regency's historic daily return as compared to the market index.  Since the award payout includes dividend equivalents and the total shareholder return includes the value of dividends, no dividend yield assumption is required for the valuation.  Compensation expense is measured at the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, regardless of whether the market condition is ultimately achieved.\n \nThe following table summarizes non-vested restricted stock activity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear ended December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNumber of Shares\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIntrinsic Value (in thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-vested as of December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n754,518\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime-based awards granted \n (1) (4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n175,396\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n61.98\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance-based awards granted \n(2) (4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17,137\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n62.21\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket-based awards granted \n(3) (4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n158,807\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n58.36\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in market-based awards earned for performance \n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,306\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n63.42\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested \n(5)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n304,785\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n63.17\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n4,590\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n64.43\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-vested as of December 31, 2024 \n(6)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n803,789\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n59,424\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(1)\nTime-based awards vest beginning on the first anniversary following the grant date over a one or four year service period\n.  These grants are subject only to continued employment and are not dependent on future performance measures.  Accordingly, if such vesting criteria are not met, compensation cost previously recognized is reversed.\n(2)\nPerformance-based awards are earned subject to performance measurements.  Once the performance criteria are achieved and the actual number of shares earned is determined, shares vest over a required service period.  The Company considers the likelihood of meeting the performance criteria based upon management's estimates from which it determines the amounts recognized as expense on a periodic basis.\n(3)\nMarket-based awards are earned dependent upon the Company's total shareholder return in relation to the shareholder return of a NAREIT index over a three-year period.  Once the performance criteria are met and the actual number of shares earned is determined, the shares are immediately vested and distributed.  The probability of meeting the criteria is considered when calculating the estimated fair value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation.  These awards are accounted for as awards with market criteria, with compensation cost recognized over the service period, regardless of whether the performance criteria are achieved and the awards are ultimately earned.

The Company owns and manages a portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers, anchored primarily by grocers. Nearly all of the Company's consolidated revenues are generated from real estate investments in shopping centers.\n\n\n115\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n\n\nThe Company derives revenue primarily by leasing retail spaces to tenants under long-term leases with varying terms that generally provide for fixed payments of base rent with stated increases over the lease term.  Some leases also include provisions for additional percentage rent based on tenant sales performance.  Additionally, most lease agreements contain provisions requiring tenants to reimburse their share of actual real estate taxes, insurance and CAM costs incurred by the Company.\nThe Company’s CODM is the Executive Committee, which is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and the Chief Investment Officer.\n  The CODM evaluates the performance of shopping centers and allocates resources on an individual property basis. Consequently, the Company defines its operating segments as individual properties. These operating segments are aggregated into \none\n reportable segment due to similarities in the nature and economics of the centers, tenant profiles, operating processes, and long-term financial performance.  The accounting policies for the shopping centers segment are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nThe CODM assesses the performance of each shopping center and allocates resources based on Net Operating Income (“NOI”).  NOI is calculated as the sum of base rent, percentage rent, termination fee income, tenant recoveries, other lease income, and other property income, less operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, ground rent, termination expense, and uncollectible lease income.  NOI excludes items such as straight-line rental income and expense, above and below market rent and ground rent amortization, tenant lease inducement amortization, and other fees.  The Company’s NOI also includes its share of NOI from unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships.  The Company does not report asset information for the segment because it is not used to evaluate performance or regularly provided to the CODM.\nThe CODM uses NOI to evaluate income generated from shopping centers (i.e., return on assets) and to guide decisions on capital investments. These decisions may include acquisitions, investments in real estate developments and/or capital improvement.\nThe following tables provide information about the shopping centers segment revenues, significant expenses, NOI and the reconciliations of these amounts to the Company’s consolidated Net income and Total

litigation and other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business.  While the outcome of any particular lawsuit or dispute cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, the Company's currently pending litigation and disputes are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations.  With respect to applicability to the Company, these pertain primarily to chemicals historically used by certain current and former dry-cleaning tenants, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, underground petroleum storage tanks and other historic land uses.  The Company believes that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on its financial position, liquidity, or operations.  The Company can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to its shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental contamination; that its estimate of liabilities will not change as more information becomes available; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to the Company; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; and that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to the Company.\nThe Company had accrued liabilities of \n$\n17.3\n million\n and \n$\n16.5\n million\n for environmental remediation, which are included in \nAccounts payable, and other liabilities\n on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets,, as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLetters of Credit\nThe Company has the right to issue letters of credit under the Line up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $\n50.0\n million, which reduces the credit availability under the Line.  These letters of credit are primarily issued as collateral on behalf of its captive insurance subsidiary and to facilitate the construction of development projects.  The Company had \n$\n10.9\n million\n and \n$\n8.5\n million\n in letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2024, and 2023\n, respectively.\n\n\n117\n\n\n\n\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND

Based on this evaluation, the Parent Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of December 31, 2024, the Parent Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms.  These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Parent Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nThe Parent Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).  Under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the Parent Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on its evaluation under the framework in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n, the Parent Company's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\nKPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent Company included in this Report and, as part of their audit, has issued a report, included within \"Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\" of this Report, on the effectiveness of the Parent Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\nThe Parent Company's system of internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\nChanges in Internal Controls\n\n\nThere have been no changes in the Parent Company's internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with this evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Parent Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.\n \n\n\nControls and Procedures (Regency Centers, L.P.)\n\n\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Operating Partnership's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of its general partner, the Operating Partnership conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of its general partner concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Operating Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
