  "item1_summary": " Our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, or that we currently believe to be immaterial . Past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance . Investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods .\n Macroeconomic conditions can, among other things, reduce or shift spending away from elective procedures, drive patients to pursue less costly orthodontic treatments . The declines in, or uncertain economic outlooks for, the United States, Chinese, European and certain other international economies have and could in the future materially adversely affect consumer and dental practice spending .\n Our products or one or more of the materials or components of our products may also be subject to tariffs imposed by the United States or other countries . We may not be able to fully mitigate the impact of the increased costs or pass price increases on to our customers, resulting in downward pressure on our operating results . Currency exchange rate fluctuations have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations .\n Tariffs or proposed tariffs, such as those on Chinese, Mexican, Canadian or other foreign goods, and any retaliatory trade measures in response may increase the cost of our products and the components and raw materials used to make them . We manufacture clear aligners in Mexico and ship them to the United States, primarily for our U.S. customers .\n Tariffs would result in additional costs for our products, which may impact operating margin . Foreign countries may adopt or rescind other measures, such as controls on the import or export of goods, technology or data, including personal data, that could adversely impact our operations and supply chains . Some employees and consultants in Israel have been called for military service in the current conflict and they may be absent for certain periods of time .\n Our operations may be impacted by natural disasters, which may become more frequent or severe as a result of climate change . China’s territorial conflicts with other neighboring countries may impact our operations and sales in China . We cannot predict the progress or outcome of these events or the reactions by governments, businesses or consumers .\n Invisalign treatment is a significant departure from traditional orthodontic wires and brackets, and our customers and consumers may not find it cost-effective or preferable . Increased acceptance of our products and services depends in part on the recommendations of dental professionals, professional associations, societies and organizations, as well as other factors, including efficacy, safety, ease of use, reliability, aesthetics, third-party reimbursement and price .\n Our net revenues are primarily dependent on sales of the Invisalign System anishlyd iTero intraoral scanners . Of the two, we expect the Ininsalign System to continue to represent the majority of our net revenues . The ASPs of our products are influenced by numerous factors, including the mix of product treatment packages, geographical mix, channel mix and timing of products sold .\n The dental industry is experiencing immense and rapid digital transformation . The Invisalign System, iTero intraoral scanners, CAD/CAM software and digital platform facilitate this transition . We face competition from companies that seek to introduce new technologies and products and companies that remain dedicated to traditional products . We may be unable to compete with these competitors or they may render our technology or products obsolete or economically .\n The number and types of competitors we face are diverse and growing rapidly . The Invisalign System competes primarily against traditional wires and brackets and increasingly with clear aligners manufactured and distributed by new market entrants and existing competitors . We may be unable to devote adequate financial resources to develop or acquire new AI technologies and systems in the future .\n We cannot assure successful development, sales or acceptance of our products and services . The extent and rate at which our new, improved or refurbished products or services achieve market acceptance and penetration depends on many factors, including our ability to predict, timely innovate, develop, develop and launch new or improved technologies, applications, features, features and products . We must also keep pace with changes in technology, customers' demands and industry standards .\n If we fail to accurately predict the needs and preferences of customers and their patients, we may invest heavily in research and development that does not lead to significant revenues . We may incur substantial costs doing so and our profitability may suffer . Introduction and acceptance of any products and services may take significant time and effort . We periodically introduce new business and sales initiatives to meet customers’ needs and demands .\n We may be unable to find suitable investment or acquisition opportunities . We may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve desired synergies and integration . Investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively and may lead to negative ratings by analysts or investors, or give rise to stockholder objections or activism, which could disrupt our operations or harm our stock price .\n The company's quarterly and annual operating results have and will continue to fluctuate for a variety of reasons . Some of the factors that have and could in the future cause our operating results will fluctuate include: changes in consumer and doctor demand, changes in manufacturing, packaging, delivery and inventory costs . The company may not realize material portions of the expected synergies and benefits of the investment or the acquisition .\n If we fail to accurately predict product demand, we may not have the appropriate level of our manufacturing capacity or that of one or more of our suppliers . We often place orders with suppliers for materials, components, sub-assemblies and finished products weeks or more in advance of projected orders . If we do not hire and train the appropriate number of technicians in anticipation of demand, our costs and expepepe .\n The majority of our expenses, such as employee compensation and lease obligations, are relatively fixed in the short term . If our net revenues for a particular period are below expectations, we may be unable to timely or effectively reduce spending to offset any shortfalls . We may be required to purchase or lease additional or larger facilities and equipment to manage demand .\n Production of the Invisalign System and iTero intraoral scanners could also be limited by capacity constraints . Issues with IT system integration, implementation, updates, and upgrades, or third-party software have previously and could again disrupt our operations . If one of these facilities is temporarily, partially or fully shut down, we may be unable to timely fulfill orders .\n All software and IT systems are vulnerable to damage, cybersecurity attacks, or interruptions or other disruptions from a variety of sources, including rapidly developing AI technologies . Usage of online and hosted technology platforms by us, our customers, and suppliers, including remote working, teledentistry, and new or expanded use of online service platforms, products, and solutions such as doctor, consumer, and patient apps have increased the demands on and risks to our IT systems and personnel .\n The discovery of a defect, error, or security vulnerability in our products, software applications or IT systems could have a material effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of our operations . The failure of our products or primary IT systems, which we are unable to cure in a timely fashion, may cause adverse consequences . Software applications and products containing software may contain errors or defects .\n A significant portion of our iTero intraoral scanners may be exposed to additional vulnerabilities, including security risks, errors, and malfunctions that may be irreparable or difficult to repair . We may not timely and adequately remediate or implement corrective measures for such failures, including due to reliance on third-party providers or suppliers . Any remediation may be time-consuming and difficult to achieve .\n Our clear aligner production is dependent on digital scans from our globally dispersed and decentralized installed base of iTero and third-party intraoral scanners . Any of these events could harm our sales, damage our reputation, adversely impact our strategic partners, or result in claims, demands, litigation, and liabilities . We are highly dependent on our supply chain, particularly manufacturers of specialized and customized scanning equipment .\n We maintain single and sole supply relationships for many of these machines and materials . We are exposed to multiple supply chain vulnerabilities . Changes in key relationships can disrupt our supply chain . Finding substitute manufacturers may be expensive, time-consuming or impossible . Technology changes by our service providers, vendors and other third parties could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity .\n Our distribution agreements are generally non-exclusive and terminable by either party with customary notice . If alternative distributors cannot be quickly found and trained, revenues and ability to sell or service our products and services in key markets could be adversely affected . Disruption in the operations of a primary freight carrier, higher shipping costs or shipping delays could disrupt our supply chain .\n If the operations of commercial freight carriers are disrupted or we fail to mitigate any disruptions, we may be unable to timely deliver products to our customers . Our success depends on our personnel. If we cannot attract, motivate, train or retain personnel, it will be difficult to achieve our strategic priorities, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations .\n The loss of any key personnel, particularly executive management, research and development, or sales personnel, could harm our business and prospects . It can take 12 months or more to train sales representatives to successfully market and sell our products and services . If we fail to effectively manage any organizational or strategic changes, our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation, will be harmed .\n The company is concerned that its work could be affected by work stoppages . The company says it is working to raise awareness of its products and services . It says it will be difficult to find a way to get around the world to meet the needs of the company . The firm says it wants to be able to continue to work with the public in the long term .\n There is no assurance our advertising campaigns will achieve the desired returns on advertising spend, increase brand, product or services awareness sufficiently or generate goodwill and positive reputational goals . Many countries prohibit certain types of marketing activities . We rely heavily on data generated from our campaigns to target specific audiences and evaluate their effectiveness . We have and may in the future be alleged to violate marketing restrictions .\n We are subject to antitrust and competition regulations, litigation and enforcement that may result in fines, penalties, restrictions on our business practices, and product, services or operational changes . Operating systems could also include data privacy settings that may limit our ability to interpret, target and measure ads effectively . Governments and regulators are actively developing new competition laws and regulations aimed at the technology sector .\n Failure to obtain or maintain approvals or comply with regulations regarding our products or services or those of our suppliers could materially harm our sales, result in substantial penalties and fines, interrupt our supply chain and cause harm to our reputation . Global regulators are expanding and changing regulations and guidance for products and services, which can limit their potential benefits and cause protracted review timelines .\n Before we can sell a new medical device or market a new use of, or claim for, an existing product, we frequently must obtain regulatory clearance or approval . Failure or the failure of our suppliers, customers, advertisers, consultants, and influencers to strictly adhere to clearances or approvals in the labeling, marketing and sales of our products and services .\n Delays or failures to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals, clearances or to comply with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our domestic or international operations . Failure to satisfactorily correct an adverse inspection finding or comply with applicable regulations can result in enforcement actions, or require us to find alternative manufacturers, which could be a long and costly process and may cause reputational harm .\n In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed its longstanding approach to evaluating administrative rulemaking under the Chevron doctrine, which provided for judicial deference to regulatory agencies, including the FDA . There may be increased challenges to existing agency regulations or how lower courts will apply the decision in the context of other regulatory schemes without more specific guidance .\n e. e retain confidential employee, applicant and customer personal, health and financial, and our own proprietary information and data essential to our operations . We rely on the effectiveness of our IT systems, policies and contracts and the policies of our third-party vendors, and their IT systems to safeguard information . Our cybersecurity controls depend on our customers, many of whom are individual or small healthcare providers with limited IT experience and inadequate or untested security protocols .\n There can be no assurance our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information . The frequency and sophistication of third-party cybersecurity attacks are increasing. This risk is exacerbated with the advancement of technologies like AI, which malicious third parties can use to create new, more sophisticated and more frequent .\n We have cybersecurity and other forms of insurance coverage related to cyberattacks, breaches, and other incidents . We cannot guarantee applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all . Damages and claims arising from incidents may not be covered, may exceed coverage limits, and may not cover the time and effort we incur investigating and responding to any incidents .\n We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations respecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information . The California Consumer Protection Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (as amended, the “CCPA”), requires covered businesses that process personal information of California residents to disclose certain practices, provides California residents with data privacy rights, imposes operational requirements .\n The collection and use of health data and other personal information is governed in the EU by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which imposes significant obligations upon companies and rights for individuals . Laws in all 50 U.S. states may require businesses to provide notice to individuals whose personal data has been disclosed as a result of a data breach .\n With laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, data governance and cybersecurity imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices . Failure or perceived failure by us or our vendors, customers, or service providers to comply with our applicable policies or notices . may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims and other proceedings, harm our reputation .\n Our products and services involve an inherent risk of claims concerning their design, materials, manufacture, safety, and performance . We may incur substantial expenses or be found liable for substantial damages or penalties if we are subject to claims or litigation . Any claim for product liability, sales, advertising and business practices, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in material legal defense costs .\n Many U.S. and foreign regulators have or are considering enacting new or additional disclosure requirements or limits on the emissions of greenhouse gases from power generated using fossil fuels . The effects of greenhouse gas emission limits on power generation are subject to significant uncertainties, including the timing of new requirements, levels of emissions reductions and scope and types of emissions regulated .\n Clean energy sources, coupled with reduced investments in traditional energy production and infrastructure, may not provide predictable, reliable and consistent energy . Sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of, or contained in, our products may be affected by laws and regulations governing the use of minerals obtained from certain regions of the world like the Democratic Republic of Congo .\n Compliance with U.S. laws and regulations is costly for us and our suppliers . We expect these regulations and costs to increase as the regulatory frameworks in each jurisdiction in which we operate become more complex and distinct . Public interest and legislative pressure related to companies’ Sustainability practices has been evolving in recent years .\n Implementation of AI and machine learning technologies may result in legal and regulatory risks, reputational harm or have other adverse consequences to our business . We are continuing to incorporate AI, including machine learning and independent algorithms, in certain of our products, services and IT systems . There can be no assurance that we or our customers will realize the expected benefits from these investments .\n The company's success depends in part on its proprietary technology, and if we fail to successfully obtain or enforce our IP rights, our competitive position may be harmed . The company may have to work with regulatory and litigation related to our AI models . This may, among other impacts, result in:inconsistencies among AI regulations and frameworks across jurisdictions .\n We may not apply for a patent if our personnel fail to disclose or recognize new patentable ideas or innovations . We also protect our IP through copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and confidentiality obligations . Despite the existence of these protections, we have experienced incidents in which our proprietary information has been misappropriated . In certain jurisdictions, enforcement of IP rights is more difficult due to legislation and geopolitical circumstances .\n A failure to protect our IP rights might allow competitors to copy our technology or create counterfeit or pirated versions of our products, which could adversely affect our reputation, pricing, and market share . As dentistry continues to become more digital, competitors may make defense of our IP more challenging . Asserting or defending these proceedings can be unpredictable, protracted, time-consuming, expensive, and distracting to managements .\n If our goodwill, intangible or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record material charges to income . The potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation are costly and could materially affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations . Additional litigation based on the same or similar claims may be brought in the future .\n Management is responsible for continually assessing qualitative factors that could negatively impact the fair value of goodwill and intangible and long-lived assets . Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations, could result in unfavorable accounting charges . We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP . A change in these principles or in the way these principles are interpreted by us or by our regulators could materially affect our current or previously issued financial statements .\n Internal controls may become ineffective because of changes in personnel, updates and upgrades to or migration away from existing software, failure to maintain accurate books and records, changes in accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards . Changes to business models may require adjustments to our financial reporting and, as a result, the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures .\n Changes in tax laws or changes to how those laws are applied to our business could affect the amount of tax which we are subject to and the manner in which we operate . We may continue to experience variation in our effective tax rate related to excess tax benefits or tax expense on stock-based compensation . We continue to monitor the enactment of the OECD/G20 Framework’s Pillar Two 15% global minimum tax .\n The application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax (SUT) and VAT) to our operations is complex and evolving . We collect and remit SUT, VAT, GST and other taxes in many jurisdictions and we are routinely subject to audits . The positions we take regarding taxes as well as the amounts we collect or remit have and may continue to be challenged .\n The company's stock price movements may be inconsistent with macroeconomic, industry, or company-specific fundamentals, including the sentiment of retail investors (as it may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock, fractional share trading, and other technical trading factors .\n The stock market in general, and the market for technology and medical device companies, in particular, often experience extreme price and volume fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to corporate operating performance . Securities litigation, including securities class action lawsuits and securities derivative lawsuits, is often brought against an issuer following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities and we have not been exempt from such litigation .\n A significant percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of stockholders . These stockholders have sold in the past, and may sell in the future, large amounts of our stock over relatively short periods of time . Sales of substantial amounts of . existing stock by existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of . our stock by creating the perception of difficulties or problems with our business .\n Our information security program leverages the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and International Organization for Standardization (IS) 27001 frameworks . This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that we use the NIST and ISO frameworks as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business .\n An external auditor conducts a System and Organization Controls (“SOC”) type 2 audit covering the security principle for systems supporting our products . An information security awareness program, which includes annual training regarding our acceptable use and information classification and handling policies, regular phishing campaigns and additional employee training as appropriate . An assessment of risks associated with the use of third-party vendors is part of our cybersecurity risk management framework .\n We may not successfully prevent or mitigate cybersecurity incidents that could have a material adverse effect on us . While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, the costs related to cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be covered or, if covered, fully insured .
