  "item1_text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are many factors that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of some important factors that may cause our business prospects, results of operations and cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. Factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nOur business depends on our vendor partner and wholesale distributor relationships and the terms of the agreements governing those relationships.\nOur solutions portfolio includes products and services from OEMs, software publishers and cloud providers. We are authorized by these vendor partners to sell all or some of their products and services via direct marketing activities. Our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions, product return privileges, services performance commitments, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding, including purchase rebates, sales volume rebates, purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements. However, our contracts with our vendor partners are primarily short-term and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party. A reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, a reduction in the amount or a change in the terms of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for, and the cost of, working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nFrom time to time, vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us. For example, there is no assurance that, as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers, they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us. Any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe purchase the products included in our portfolio both directly from our vendor partners and from wholesale distributors. A significant portion of our sales are derived from products manufactured by Apple, Cisco, Dell Technologies, HP Inc., Lenovo and Microsoft. In addition, purchases from two wholesale distributors, Ingram Micro and TD SYNNEX, represent over 25% of our total purchases. The loss of, or change in business relationship with, any of these or any other wholesale distributors or key vendor partners, or the diminished availability of their products, including due to backlogs for their products, could reduce the supply and impact the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position.\nFurther, the sale, spin-off or combination of any of our key vendor partners or wholesale distributors and/or certain of their business units, including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell, or our inability to develop relationships with new and emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur sales are dependent on continued innovations in technology by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings, and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers.\nThe technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware, software and services, such as cloud-based and other “as a service” solutions, hyper-converged infrastructure, embedded software solutions and solutions that incorporate artificial intelligence. We have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in technology, as well as the adoption of those innovations by customers. Also, customers may delay spending while they evaluate new technologies. A decrease in the rate of innovation, a lack of adoption of innovations by our customers or delays in technology spending by our customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, if we are unable to anticipate and expand our capabilities to keep pace with changes in technology and new hardware, software and services, for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers, specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers, our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware, software and services to compete effectively with hardware, software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or \n10\nTable of Contents\nthat we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels. To the extent that a vendor’s offering that is in high demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels, and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels, our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nIssues relating to the use or capabilities of artificial intelligence, including social, ethical and safety issues, in hardware, software and services offerings may result in reputational harm, liability or increased costs. \nSocial, ethical and safety issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence-based technologies, including generative AI in our hardware, software and service offerings, as well as in our internal platforms, may result in reputational harm and liability. Certain of the hardware, software and services we offer increasingly utilize AI, and, as with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we use, enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm and/or legal liability. Increased focus and potential government regulation of AI may also increase the burden and cost of compliance in this area, subjecting us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm and/or legal liability. Failure to address AI issues by us or others in our industry could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services. \nAdditionally, the development, adoption and use of AI by us or our vendor partners could result in unintended consequences, including exposing us to additional risks related to cybersecurity, privacy and data security, such as the risk of increased vulnerability to cybersecurity threats and exposure or theft of proprietary or sensitive information (which could result in such information being made available to our competitors and other members of the public), impacts to the stability of our operations, the generation of factually incorrect or biased outputs, reliance on outdated or unverified data, potential intellectual property infringements, the inability to protect generated content while facing unfavorable licensing terms and the inability to attract and retain key personnel. AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition in the market and from other companies regarding such technologies. Further, the responsible development and deployment of AI requires ongoing investment in research, development and governance, which could adversely affect our results of operation or cash flows. \nSubstantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance.\nWe compete with resellers, manufacturers who sell directly to customers, large service providers and system integrators, communications service providers, cloud providers, e-commerce companies and office supply retailers, among others. We expect the competitive landscape to continue to evolve as new technologies and consumption models emerge, such as cloud-based and other “as a service” solutions, hyper-converged infrastructure, embedded software solutions and solutions that incorporate artificial intelligence. Our continued competitiveness depends upon our ability to anticipate and evolve at pace and scale with new technologies, services and solutions through strategic and timely investments in innovation, expansion of offerings and the capabilities necessary to implement them.\nWhile innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell, it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors. For instance, while cloud-based solutions present an opportunity for us, cloud-based solutions and technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us, or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell. In addition, some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell, and could intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to our customers. Moreover, traditional OEMs have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions, which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers. If we are unable to effectively respond to the evolving competitive landscape, or respond in a manner that is less effective than that of our competitors, our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe focus on providing high quality service to gain new customers and retain existing customers. To the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers, we may be required to reduce prices, increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales, which may require us to reduce prices. This would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of Net sales and Gross profit. If such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products, our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe success of our business depends on the continuing development, maintenance and operation of our information technology systems.\nOur success is dependent on the accuracy, proper utilization and continuing operation, maintenance and development of our information technology systems, including our business systems, such as our sales, customer management, financial and accounting, marketing, purchasing, warehouse management, e-commerce and mobile systems, as well as our operational platforms, including voice and data networks and power systems, which may include third-party hosted systems or systems that may utilize cloud technologies outside of our control. The quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems, and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades, including our transformation initiatives, could adversely affect, among other things, our ability to:\n•\nconduct business with our customers, including delivering services and solutions to them;\n•\nprovide the means to effectively manage global operations across time zones;\n•\nkeep pace with changes and innovation and compete effectively;\n•\neffectuate comprehensive and reliable data collection, maintenance and governance;\n•\nmanage our inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable;\n•\nsupport planned growth in services and solutions and continued evolution of the business;\n•\npurchase, sell, ship and invoice our hardware and software products and provide and invoice our services efficiently and on a timely basis; \n•\nmaintain an effective internal control environment around our financial close process and regulatory reporting requirements;\n•\nexecute the financial close processes and deliver our required financial reporting with the SEC; and\n•\nmaintain our cost-efficient operating model while scaling our business.\nOur information technology systems are inherently exposed to varied technological threats beyond our control. While we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats, both internal and external, and from human error, there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective. Furthermore, although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems, there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required. Moreover, software vulnerabilities within the third-party information technology software and systems we use are discovered and reported on nearly a daily basis. When made public or otherwise known to us, we attempt to remediate or mitigate these vulnerabilities following guidance provided by the software vendor, and/or appropriate authorities, and before the vulnerability is successfully used in a cyberattack against our systems. If and when cyberattacks target and successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, we take steps designed to contain and limit the impact on our business. Any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly impact our ongoing business operations, harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to comply with customer, partner, legal or regulatory obligations.\nWe maintain and periodically upgrade many of our information technology systems, some of which are complex, costly and time consuming. If our information technology systems are not properly maintained or enhanced, the attention of our coworkers could be diverted and our ability to provide the level of service our customers demand could be constrained for some time. Further, new information technology systems and updates to existing information technology systems may not properly integrate with other information technology systems. Also, once implemented, the new information technology systems, updates to existing information technology systems and related technology may not provide the intended efficiencies or anticipated benefits, or could be defective, contain a security vulnerability or improperly installed or managed, and could add costs, complications and disruptions to our ongoing operations.  \nFrom time to time, we may acquire new companies, businesses or sites with cybersecurity and data protection systems which may not conform with our standards. It may require significant time and expense to upgrade and integrate such systems and controls, and if we are unable to do so in a timely manner, or at all, failures or breaches of such systems could harm our reputation, business and results of operations due to failure to comply with customer, partner, legal or regulatory obligations.\n12\nTable of Contents\nBreaches of data security and the failure to protect our information technology systems from cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business.\nOur business involves the handling, storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of coworkers, customers, partners and others, which we must do in compliance with applicable law. In connection with our services business, some of our coworkers have access to our customers’ confidential data and other information. Additionally, third parties, such as data center colocation and hosted solution partners, provide services to us and also provide services as a component of our services delivery to customers and to customer systems. These third parties or others that are a part of our supply chain could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure to protect their own products, security systems and infrastructure and we may not be able to control the manner in which these third parties respond to any security breach. We have privacy and data security policies, practices and controls in place that are designed to prevent security breaches; however, as newer technologies evolve, as more business is conducted over the internet and remotely, as we acquire more business operations from targets with differing cybersecurity and data protection controls and as the portfolio of the service providers we exchange confidential information, software and/or hardware with expands, we have been subject to breaches in security and are increasingly likely to be exposed to risks from breaches in security, including those arising from human error, negligence or mismanagement or from illegal or fraudulent acts, such as cyberattacks. Further, as AI continues to evolve, malicious actors could use AI to enhance the sophistication and coordination of their attacks, which could pose significant challenges to our security defenses. Additionally, as technology vendors consolidate and aggregate applications into unified platforms, the risk and magnitude of business disruption from security breaches increases due to vendor/system concentration. \nWe, and third parties upon which we rely, regularly experience malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems, and attacks against us by state-sponsored organizations and nation-states may increase during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflicts. Further, security breaches may go undetected and persist in our environments for extended periods. Although we have not experienced a material security breach to date, the evolving and escalating nature of cybersecurity threats, in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists, state-sponsored organizations and nation-states, including computer viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, make it increasingly challenging to anticipate, detect and defend against these threats. We and our third-party partners have implemented various security controls to meet compliance and privacy requirements while defending against these evolving security threats. However, breaches in security could expose us, our supply chain, our customers or other individuals to significant disruptions and a risk of public disclosure, loss or misuse of confidential data. \nSecurity breaches could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information (including those under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Privacy Rights Act), significant remediation costs as well as the loss of partners and existing or potential customers and, ultimately, damage to our brand and reputation and adversely impact our business. While we maintain insurance coverages that are intended to address certain aspects of data security, such insurance may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise, and may not continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all. Moreover, media or other reports of perceived vulnerabilities in our network security or perceived lack of security within our environment, even if inaccurate, could materially adversely impact our reputation and business. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could also be material. Such breaches, costs and consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we or our third-party service providers fail to provide high-quality services to our customers, our reputation, brand, business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur services include professional services, managed services, warranties, configuration services, partner services and telecom services. Additionally, we deliver and manage mission critical software, systems and network solutions for our customers. We also offer certain services, such as implementation and installation services and repair services, to our customers through various third-party service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf. If we or our third-party service providers fail to provide high-quality services to our customers or such services result in an unplanned disruption of our customers’ businesses, this could, among other things, result in legal claims and proceedings and liability for us. Moreover, as we expand our services and solutions business and provide increasingly complex services and solutions, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory and other risks. We also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation with our customers, our brand and our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\n13\nTable of Contents\nIf we lose any of our key personnel, are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our labor costs significantly increase or our approach to workforce management is ineffective, our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer.\nOur success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, engage and retain key personnel to manage, lead, innovate and grow our business, including our key executive, management, sales, services, specialists and engineers. Additionally, we rely on offshore operations to execute and deliver on certain functions within the organization.\nOur future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of our leadership team, as well as the effectiveness of our succession planning and efforts to develop and promote top talent. Our future success also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our customer-facing coworkers, who have been given critical CDW knowledge regarding, and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with, many of our customers. In addition, as we seek to expand our offerings of value-added services and solutions, our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly-skilled specialists and engineers, for whom the market is extremely competitive.\nIn order to attract, retain and motivate key personnel in a competitive marketplace, it is important to provide a competitive compensation package. If our compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could be adversely affected. Additionally, as minimum wage rates increase or related laws and regulations change, we have and may need to continue to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage coworkers, but also the wages paid to our other hourly or salaried coworkers.\nA sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our coworker base could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain coworkers, and could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, if we fail to effectively manage our workforce, we may need to terminate or reposition coworkers within our Company to eliminate an abundance of or to reconfigure resources, which could damage our coworker relations and our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nIf we are unable to attract, develop, engage and retain key personnel, or if our approach to workforce management, including management of our offshore operations, is ineffective, our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and our ability to expand our offerings of value-added services and solutions could be adversely affected. Moreover, if we are unable to continue to train our sales, services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers, the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel could decrease. Such consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have outsourced certain business processes to third-party outsource partners and any service failures or disruptions related to these outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our outsource partners, including offshore partners, to execute and deliver on certain business processes within the organization. While we make significant effort to conduct appropriate diligence before entering into arrangements with an outsourcing partner, failure by these outsource partners to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, including cybersecurity protections, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance, could negatively impact our operations, expected cost savings or efficiencies, and could result in work stoppages, strikes or performance issues with such outsource partners. As a result of these outsourcing arrangements, we may experience interruptions or delays in our processes, loss or theft of proprietary or sensitive data or other cybersecurity issues, compliance issues, challenges in maintaining and reporting financial and operational information, and increased costs to remediate any unanticipated issues that arise, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or a third-party provider location could damage our business.\nIf the warehouse and distribution equipment or operations at one of our distribution centers or such facilities or operations of our outsource partners were to be seriously damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster, which may increase in number or severity as a result of climate change, or other adverse occurrence, including disruption related to political or social unrest, we could utilize another distribution center or third-party distributors to ship products to our customers. However, this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and could cause us to incur incremental operating costs. In addition, we operate numerous facilities which may contain both business-critical data and confidential information of our customers and third parties, such as data center colocation, managed services sites and hosted solution partners, and third parties provide services as a component of our services delivery to customers. A natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of our major data storage locations, managed services sites or third-party provider locations could negatively impact our business, results of operations or cash flows.\n14\nTable of Contents\nIncreases in the cost of commercial delivery services or disruptions of those services could materially adversely impact our business.\nWe generally ship hardware products to our customers by FedEx, United Parcel Service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges. If we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services (including those that may result from an increase in fuel or personnel costs or a need to use higher cost delivery channels during periods of increased demand), our profitability could be adversely affected. Additionally, strikes, inclement weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers or periods of increased demand on delivery services, such as those we have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially adversely affect our ability to deliver or receive products on a timely basis.\nWe are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks.\nWe extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our sales. We are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced. These risks are heightened during periods of global or industry-specific economic downturn or uncertainty, during periods of rising interest rates or, in the case of public sector customers, during periods of budget constraints or budget cuts. Further, evolving product delivery models, such as multi-year subscriptions, may result in prolonged risk as customer terms extend in duration. Significant failures of customers to timely pay all amounts due to us could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell. In addition to drop-ship arrangements with many of our OEMs and wholesale distributors, we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies, including our rapid-turn inventory model, as well as vendor price protection and product return programs. However, if we were unable to maintain our rapid-turn inventory model, if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions, our inventory risks could increase. We also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request or to manage supply chain interruptions. If we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce, delay or decommit from orders, and if we were unable to return the inventory to a vendor partner, we would be exposed to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence.\nWe could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances.\nWe may continue to pursue transactions, including strategic investments, acquisitions or alliances, in an effort to extend or complement our existing business. These types of transactions involve numerous business risks, including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us, the diversion of management’s attention from other business priorities, extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience, entering into new geographic markets, an acquisition target’s differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data protection controls, the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses. There can be no assurance that the intended benefits of our investments, acquisitions and alliances will be realized, or that those benefits will offset these numerous risks or other unforeseen factors, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded. To the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may result in volatility in the market price of our stock and could impact our ability to operate our business effectively.\nWe may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations. These fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors, including the state of the technology industry in general, shifts in demand and pricing for hardware, software and services, the introduction of new products or upgrades. Further, if our customers’ businesses are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions such as cost inflation or rising interest rates, they may delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operating results are also highly dependent on Gross profit. Our Gross profit fluctuates due to numerous factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including general macroeconomic conditions including inflation; pricing pressures; \n15\nTable of Contents\nchanges in product costs from our vendor partners; the availability of price protection, purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners; changes in product, order size and customer mix; the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete; increases in product and delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers; and general market and competitive conditions.\nIn addition, our cost structure is based, in part, on anticipated sales and gross margins. Therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall, and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nFluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our reported results of operations.\nOur exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. While our Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in US dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the US are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into US dollars. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the US dollar relative to the local currencies of our international subsidiaries, particularly the British pound and the Canadian dollar, could cause material fluctuations in our reported results of operations. We also have foreign currency exposure to the extent sales and purchases are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nGlobal and regional economic and political conditions may have an adverse impact on our business.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, including pandemics such as COVID-19, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, outsource partners, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nWeak or unstable economic conditions generally, inflation and actions taken by central banks to counter inflation (such as those that prevailed in recent years), sustained uncertainty about global political conditions, periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, government spending cuts and the impact of new government policies (including the introduction of new or increased taxes, the imposition of minimum taxes or new or increased limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits, or any other changes to tax laws), or a tightening of credit markets, including as a result of rising interest rates or bank failures, could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nDecreases or delays in spending on technology products and services by our customers due to, among other things, customer spending decisions and government spending and funding policies may have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur sales are impacted by customer decisions on budget priorities and technology spending, including decisions to defer any such spending. Our customer’s spending decisions and budget priorities have and can be impacted by government spending and funding policies, especially but not exclusively for our public sector, healthcare and education customers, and our other customers that do business with our public sector customers or otherwise rely directly or indirectly on government funding. Federal government spending policies and budget priorities often shift during a change in federal administration, which has and can create increased levels of uncertainty with respect to these policies and priorities. An adverse change or anticipated change in government spending or funding policies (such as budget cuts or limitations), shifts in budget priorities, reductions in revenue levels or significant government shutdowns could cause our customers to reduce or delay their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, such adverse change in government spending policies, shifts in budget priorities or reductions in revenue levels could impact cash collections from contracts which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain.\nOur business depends on the timely supply of products in order to meet the demands of our customers. Manufacturing interruptions or delays, including as a result of the financial instability or bankruptcy of manufacturers, significant labor disputes such as strikes, natural disasters (which may increase in number or severity as a result of climate change), political or social unrest, armed conflict, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other public health crises, or other adverse occurrences affecting any of our suppliers’ facilities, could disrupt our supply chain and cause volatility in our level of inventory and delays in completion of orders and installations for our customers. We have experienced and could in the future experience product constraints due to the failure of suppliers to accurately forecast customer demand, or to manufacture sufficient quantities of product to meet customer demand (including as a result of shortages of product components), among \n16\nTable of Contents\nother reasons. Additionally, the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for, and the cost of, working capital and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nMoreover, supply chain disruptions have caused and could in the future cause us to experience more volatility in our level of inventory and delays in completion of orders and installations for our customers and could exacerbate inflationary pressures, such as those that prevailed in recent years. Supply chain pressures have and could in the future cause us to experience changes in average selling prices and our gross margins on certain products as customers have become and could in the future become more price sensitive.\nOur supply chain is also exposed to risks related to international operations. While we purchase our products primarily in the markets we serve (for example, products for US customers are sourced in the US), our vendor partners manufacture or purchase a significant portion of the products we sell outside of the US, primarily in Asia. Political, social or economic instability in Asia, or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell, could cause disruptions in trade, including exports to the US. Other events related to international operations that could cause disruptions to our supply chain include:\n•\nthe imposition of additional trade law provisions or regulations, including the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions;\n•\nthe imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on imports and exports, including any resulting retaliatory tariffs or charges and any reductions in the production of products subject to such tariffs and charges;\n•\nforeign currency fluctuations; and\n•\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds.\nWe cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell, or any components of those products, are purchased or manufactured will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the US or foreign governments, including the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, may result in new and rapidly evolving trade restrictions and sanctions. Trade restrictions, including new or increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, sanctions, safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, our exports are subject to regulations, some of which may be inconsistent, and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe failure to comply with our public sector contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in, among other things, termination, fines or other liabilities, and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nRevenues from our public sector customers are derived from sales to governmental entities, educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services. Sales to public sector customers are highly regulated and present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. Noncompliance with contract provisions, government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations (including the False Claims Act, the Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the US) or security clearance and confidentiality requirements could result in civil, criminal and administrative liability, including substantial monetary fines or damages, termination of government contracts or other public sector customer contracts, and suspension, debarment or ineligibility from doing business with governmental entities or other customers in the public sector. In addition, contracts in the public sector are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization (“GPO”) or upon default and public sector contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, rejections or delays, which could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Furthermore, our inability to enter into or retain contracts with GPOs may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those GPOs and compete effectively. The effect of any of these possible actions or failures could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits, including intellectual property infringement claims, which may result in substantial costs and expenses or interruption of our normal business operations.\nWe are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, which include commercial, employment, tort and other litigation. \nWe are also subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business, either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services, in the form of cease-and-desist letters, licensing inquiries, lawsuits and other communications and demands. In our industry, such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased. Increasingly, many of these assertions are brought by non-practicing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue, but we may also be subject to demands from inventors, competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue, lost profits and/or an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities, including selling certain products or services.\nIn addition, we are subject to proceedings, investigations and audits by federal, state, international, national, provincial and local authorities, including as a result of our significant sales to governmental entities. For example, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand, issued by the US Department of Justice (“DOJ”) on June 11, 2024, in connection with a False Claims Act investigation. The DOJ requested information relating to bids the Company submitted for contracts funded in whole or in part by the Schools and Libraries Program (E-Rate Program).\nWe also are subject to audits by various partners, group purchasing organizations and customers, including government agencies, relating to purchases and sales under various contracts. In addition, we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts.\nCurrent and future litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome. In addition, these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations. Litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations applicable to our operations or failure to meet stakeholder expectations on environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility matters could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur global operations span a variety of legal regimes, subjecting us to numerous complex, diverse, evolving and at times potentially inconsistent or conflicting laws and regulations in a number of areas, including labor and employment, advertising, e-commerce, tax, trade, import and export controls, economic and trade sanctions, anti-corruption, data privacy and security requirements,\n \ncompetition, environmental, social and governance and health and safety. The evaluation of and compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements, including evolving laws and regulations and regulatory overhaul during any change in federal administration, may be onerous and expensive, and may have other adverse impacts on our business, results of operations or cash flows, the risk of which will be heightened as we expand the products and services we offer, expand into new markets and channels and expand internationally. For example, we may be subject to increased costs and use of operational resources associated with complying with a myriad of new environmental, social and governance related laws and regulations. \nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no guarantee against coworkers, contractors or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. Additionally, there is increased focus by stakeholders on environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility matters, and stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s commitments and initiatives on such matters. Our disclosure on these matters and our failure, or perceived failure, to meet our commitments (including with respect to climate change) or otherwise effectively address these matters may erode customer trust or confidence, particularly if such failures or perceived failures receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, and could have a negative impact on our business.\nAs a public company, we also are subject to increasingly complex public disclosure, corporate governance and accounting requirements that increase compliance costs and require significant management focus.\n18\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $5.8 billion of total debt outstanding and $355 million of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements, and the ability to borrow an additional $1.2 billion under our senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the “Revolving Loan Facility”). Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n•\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n•\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments on our and our subsidiaries’ debt, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n•\nrequiring us to comply with restrictive covenants in our senior credit facilities and indentures, which limit the manner in which we conduct our business;\n•\nmaking it more difficult for us to obtain financing from our vendor partners, including original equipment manufacturers, software publishers and cloud providers, and our wholesale distributors;\n•\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;\n•\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less-leveraged competitors;\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and\n•\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.\nRestrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and, to a lesser degree, our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity.\nOur senior credit facilities and, to a lesser degree, our indentures contain, and any future indebtedness of ours may contain, various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n•\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n•\nreceive dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries;\n•\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n•\npledge our assets as collateral;\n•\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and\n•\nengage in sale leaseback transactions.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. A breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders:\n•\nwill not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n•\ncould elect to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable; or \n•\ncould require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.\nThe acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures.\nIf the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such \n19\nTable of Contents\nindebtedness. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to us.\nFailure to maintain the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nMajor debt rating agencies regularly evaluate our debt based on a number of factors, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our financial position, so warrant. We may not be able to maintain our existing investment grade ratings from certain credit rating agencies, and the failure to do so could increase the cost of servicing certain of our existing indebtedness and make it more difficult to raise debt financing on favorable terms in the future.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt. This could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our level of indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, could increase. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.2 billion available for additional borrowing under our Revolving Loan Facility.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nCertain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2024, we had $635 million of variable rate debt outstanding. When interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and could negatively impact our net income absent any derivative instruments. From time to time, we may execute derivative instruments to reduce interest rate volatility, subject to acceptable terms. We cannot assure you we will enter into such derivative instruments in the future or that such instruments will be effective.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile. Our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares, due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, which may be caused by a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the following:\n•\nchanges in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of our common stock;\n•\ndowngrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n•\nfuture sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n•\nmarket conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole including market expectations of changes in interest rates;\n•\ninvestors’ perceptions of our prospects;\n•\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments; and\n•\nchanges in key personnel.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. In the past, securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\n20\nTable of Contents\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock and depress our stock price.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that may be considered favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the Company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions:\n•\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n•\ngenerally prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n•\nprovide that special meetings of the stockholders can only be called in accordance with certain requirements and limitations set forth in our amended and restated bylaws;\n•\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n•\nprovide that our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless Board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program.\nWe expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock. However, any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Any determination to pay dividends on, or repurchase, shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions (including in current or future agreements governing our indebtedness), restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock. If we do not pay dividends in the future, realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nWe have a dedicated team of information security professionals who leads our enterprise-wide cyber security strategy, risk management, cyber defense, software security, security monitoring and other related functions. \nThis team is overseen by our \nChief Information Security Officer (“CISO”)\n, who reports to our Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”). \nThe CISO has extensive \n21\nTable of Contents\nbackground in that role at an enterprise level and has over 20 years of experience in the field of cybersecurity.\n \nAdditionally, the processes overseen by our global information security team are integrated with our enterprise risk management program, including routine reporting on cyber risk through the different levels of the enterprise risk management governance structure and alignment on risk management frameworks and processes.\n \nOur corporate information security management program is ISO 27001 certified, and we undergo routine audits by an independent, certified accreditation body to maintain this certification. Our program is designed to guide our practices which are based on relevant industry frameworks and laws. This program consists of policies, practices and procedures designed to manage material risks from cybersecurity threats, including training requirements, threat monitoring and detection and threat containment and risk assessments. Additionally, \nwe leverage third-party firms to conduct routine external and internal penetration testing to emulate the common tactics and techniques of cyber threat actors and have processes to address identified vulnerabilities, although it may take time to mitigate or manage such vulnerabilities.\n \nWe also have policies and procedures to oversee and identify the cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers for both internal use and external use.\n These policies and procedures include onboarding risk assessments prior to engagement and, as appropriate based on identified risk, may include cybersecurity-related contractual terms and periodic risk assessments throughout the life cycle of the third-party relationship. Lastly, we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for the size and complexity of our business to cover certain costs related to cybersecurity incidents. We refine our cybersecurity program by staying informed on security threats, leveraging third-party cybersecurity firms and investing in enhancements to our preventive and defensive capabilities.\nIn addition to our policies and procedures to manage and identify cybersecurity risks, we have an incident response plan designed to analyze, contain, remediate and communicate cybersecurity matters to help ensure a timely and robust response to actual or attempted incidents. \nAs of the date of this report, we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\n However, we cannot provide assurance that these threats will not result in such an impact in the future.
