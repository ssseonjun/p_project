We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for Cash and Cash Equivalents in 2024. \nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n89\n \nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses – Commercial Loans\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $4,486 million as of December 31, 2024, of which $3,148 million relates to commercial loans. For commercial loans, the determination of the allowance is based on historical loss experience, current borrower risk characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. As disclosed by management, they consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses and have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. To forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, management generates four economic forecast scenarios using a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking judgment. Management used a number of economic variables in their scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being Real GDP and the U.S. unemployment rate. Management incorporates qualitative reserves in the allowance for credit losses that reflect their best estimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. Such qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, industry concentration and conditions, changes in market conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the Company’s portfolio, recent credit quality trends, recent loss experience in particular portfolios, recent macroeconomic factors, limitations of available input data, model imprecision, changes in lending policies, and timing of available information.  \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in developing economic forecast scenarios of Real GDP and the U.S. unemployment rate, in determining the weighting given to each economic forecast scenario, and in estimating qualitative reserves, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence related to management’s significant judgements and estimations, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.  \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans, including controls over the economic forecast scenarios of Real GDP and the U.S. unemployment rate, the weighting given to each economic forecast scenario, and the qualitative reserves. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in the estimate, and (iii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (a) the appropriateness of certain methodologies and commercial loss forecasting models used by management, (b) the reasonableness of certain borrower risk characteristics, (c) the reasonableness of certain economic forecast scenarios, including Real GDP and the US unemployment rate, (d) the reasonableness of management’s weighting given to each economic forecast scenario used in the loss forecasting models, and (e) certain qualitative reserves made to the model output results to determine the overall allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. \n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 21,

Our retail branch network is located coast-to-coast. We also have strategic international offices in \nfour\n countries outside the U.S.\nN\nOTE\n 1 \nA\nCCOUNTING\n P\nOLICIES  \nBasis of Financial Statement Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned, certain partnership interests and VIEs.\nWe prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current period presentation, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have also considered the impact of subsequent events on these consolidated financial statements through the date of issuance of the consolidated financials.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time of preparation, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Our most significant estimates pertain to the ACL and our fair value measurements. Actual results may differ from the estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and due from banks are considered cash and cash equivalents\n \nfor financial reporting purposes because they represent a primary source of liquidity. Certain cash balances within Cash and due from banks on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.\nEffective for the second quarter of 2024, we updated our policy to classify Interest-earning deposits with banks as Cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows when reconciling Cash and due from banks and restricted cash. We believe this presentation enhances the usefulness of financial reporting because management views these funds as a source of liquidity for future transactions, while enhancing comparability to align with industry practice. There is no impact to our Consolidated Income Statement (including EPS), Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, or Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. All periods presented herein reflect this change.\nTo reflect the change in accounting policy, we adjusted the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. \nThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 included an adjustment of $\n16.5\n billion from Net cash provided (used) by investing activities to Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period. The $\n16.5\n billion was comprised of $\n16.5\n billion previously reported in Net change in Interest-earning deposits with banks and less than $(\n0.1\n) billion previously reported in Other investing activities, net. Additionally, we included $\n27.3\n billion of Interest-earning deposits with banks in Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period, and $\n43.8\n billion of Interest-earning deposits with banks in Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period.\nThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 included an adjustment of $(\n46.9\n) billion from Net cash provided (used) by investing activities to Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period. The $(\n46.9\n) billion was previously reported in Net change in Interest-earning deposits with banks. Additionally, we included $\n74.2\n billion of Interest-earning deposits with banks in Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period, and $\n27.3\n billion of Interest-earning deposits with banks in Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period. \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n97\n \nInvestments\nWe hold interests in various types of investments. The accounting for these investments is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, items such as:\n•\nOwnership interest,\n•\nOur plans for the investment, and\n•\nThe nature of the investment.\nDebt Securities\nDebt securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. We classify debt securities as either trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Debt securities that we purchase for certain risk management activities or customer-related trading activities are classified as trading securities and reported in the Other assets line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. For debt securities classified as trading, realized and unrealized gains and losses within our capital markets business are included in Capital markets and advisory noninterest income; other realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in Other noninterest income. We classify debt securities as held-to-maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity, and carry them at amortized cost, less any allowance. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading are classified as securities available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in AOCI net of income taxes.\n \nWe include all interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investment securities, in net interest income using the constant effective yield method generally calculated over the contractual lives of the securities. Effective yields generally reflect the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition. We compute gains and losses realized on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities on a specific security basis. These securities gains and losses are included in Securities gains (losses) on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nThe CECL standard requires expected credit losses on both held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities to be recognized through a valuation allowance, ACL, instead of as a direct write-down to the amortized cost basis of the security. An available-for-sale security is considered impaired if the fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. If any portion of the decline in fair value is related to credit, the amount of allowance is determined as the portion related to credit, limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security. If we have the intent to sell, or believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell an impaired available-for-sale security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the credit loss is recorded as a direct write-down of the amortized cost basis. Credit losses on investment securities are recognized through Provision for credit losses on our Consolidated Income Statement. Declines in the fair value of available-for-sale securities that are not considered credit related are recognized in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. \nWe consider a security to be past due in terms of payment based on its contractual terms. A security may be placed on nonaccrual, with interest no longer recognized until received, when collectability of principal or interest is doubtful. As of December 31, 2024, nonaccrual or past due held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities were immaterial.\nA security may be partially or fully charged-off against the allowance if it is determined to be uncollectible, including for an available-for-sale security, if we have the intent to sell or believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis. Recoveries of previously charged-off available-for-sale securities are recognized when received, while recoveries on held-to-maturity securities are recognized when expected.\nSee the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this Note 1 for further discussion regarding the methodologies used to determine the\nallowance for investment securities. See Note 2 Investment Securities for additional information about the investment securities portfolio and the related ACL.\nEquity Securities and Partnership Interests\nWe account for equity securities, equity investments, private equity investments, and investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other investments that are not required to be consolidated under one of the following methods:\n•\nWe use the equity method for general and limited partner ownership interests and limited liability companies in which we are considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Under the equity method, we record our equity ownership share of net income or loss of the investee in Noninterest income and any dividends received on equity method investments are recorded as a reduction to the investment balance. When an equity method investment experiences an other-than-temporary decline in value, we record a loss on the investment. \n•\nWe measure equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value at fair value through Net income. We do not consider contractual restrictions on the sale of an equity security when measuring fair value. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in Noninterest income. Dividend income on these equity securities is included in Other interest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.\n98\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n•\nWe generally use the practicability exception to fair value measurement for all other investments without a readily determinable fair value. When we elect this alternative measurement method, the investment is recorded at cost and the carrying value is adjusted for impairment, if any, plus or minus changes in value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar instruments of the same issuer. Adjustments to fair value based on changes in observable price are recorded in Other noninterest income. These investments are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates impairment and the fair value is less than the carrying value. The amount of the write-down is accounted for as a loss included in Other noninterest income. Distributions received on these investments are included in Other noninterest income. \nInvestments described above are included in Equity investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nPrivate Equity Investments\nWe report private equity investments, which include direct investments in companies, affiliated partnership interests and indirect investments in private equity funds, at estimated fair value. These estimates are based on available information and may not necessarily represent amounts that we will ultimately realize through distribution, sale or liquidation of the investments. The valuation procedures applied to direct investments and indirect investments are detailed in Note 14 Fair Value. We include all private equity investments within Equity investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value of private equity investments are recognized in Other noninterest income.\nWe consolidate affiliated partnerships when we have determined that we have control of the partnership or are the primary beneficiary if the entity is a VIE. The portion we do not own is reflected in Noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLoans\nLoans are classified as held for investment when management has both the intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff. Management’s intent and view of the foreseeable future may change based on changes in business strategies, the economic environment, market conditions and the availability of government programs.\nMeasurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due are considered delinquent. The CARES Act credit reporting rules, which required exceptions to this policy, expired in the third quarter of 2023. As such, delinquency status at December 31, 2023 is being reported for all loans based on the contractual terms of each loan. Prior period amounts continue to be presented in accordance with the credit reporting rules under the CARES Act, which required certain loans modified due to pandemic-related hardships to not be reported as past due based on the contractual terms of the loan, even when borrowers may not have made payments on their loans during the modification period. \nLoans held for investment, excluding PCD loans, are recorded at amortized cost basis unless we elect to measure these under the fair value option. Amortized cost basis represents principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, premiums or discounts on purchased loans and charge-offs. Amortized cost basis does not include accrued interest, as we include accrued interest in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest on performing loans is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and recorded in Interest income as earned using the constant effective yield method over the contractual life. Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs, and loan premiums and discounts are deferred and accreted or amortized into net interest income using the constant effective yield method, over the contractual life of the loan. Loans under the fair value option are reported at their fair value, with any changes to fair value reported as Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement and are excluded from measurement of ALLL.\nIn addition to originating loans, we also acquire loans through the secondary loan market, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of other financial services companies. Certain acquired loans that have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination (\ni.e.\n, PCD) are recognized at an amortized cost basis equal to their purchase price plus an ALLL measured at the acquisition date. PNC considers a variety of factors in connection with the identification of more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality, including but not limited to nonperforming status, delinquency, risk ratings and other qualitative factors that indicate deterioration in credit quality since origination. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows that are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality are recognized through a charge to the provision for credit losses resulting in an increase in the ALLL. Subsequent increases in expected cash flows are recognized as a provision recapture of previously recorded ALLL\n.\n \nWe consider a loan to be collateral dependent when we determine that substantially all of the expected cash flows will be generated\nfrom the operation or sale of the collateral underlying the loan, or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we have elected to measure the loan at the estimated fair value of collateral (less costs to sell if sale or foreclosure of the property is expected).\nAdditionally, we consider a loan to be collateral dependent when foreclosure or liquidation of the underlying collateral is probable.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n99\n \nOn January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02 \nFinancial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures \n(ASU 2022-02), which eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and replaces TDRs with loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, or FDMs. FDMs occur as a result of our loss mitigation activities. A variety of solutions are offered to borrowers, including loan modifications that may result in principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, repayment plans or combinations thereof: \n•\nPrincipal forgiveness includes principal and accrued interest forgiveness. \n•\nInterest rate reductions include modifications where the interest rate is reduced and/or interest is deferred. \n•\nTerm extensions extend the original contractual maturity date of the loan. \n•\nPayment delays consist of modifications where we expect to collect contractual amounts due but that result in a delay in the receipt of payments specified under the original loan terms. We generally consider payment delays to be insignificant when the delay is three months or less.  \n•\nRepayment plans are offered for some of our credit card and unsecured line of credit products, which provide for a reduced payment and interest rate for a specific period of time.\nAdditionally, modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty also result from borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their obligations to us, and those that enter into trial modifications. \nFDMs exclude loans held for sale and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Our disclosed FDM population also excludes government insured or guaranteed education loans as loss mitigation activities for these loans are either required by law or they are considered separate from PNC’s loss mitigation treatments. Commercial loans with an appraised value of collateral that exceeds the loan value, loans with guarantor support, and residential mortgage government insured or guaranteed loans are included in our disclosed population of FDMs when those loan modifications are granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. \nFDMs continue to be subject to our existing nonaccrual policies. Expected losses or recoveries on FDMs have been factored into the ALLL estimates for each loan class under the methodologies described in this Note 1. Refer to Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for more information on FDMs. \nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, a TDR was considered a loan whose terms had been restructured in a manner that granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. A concession had been granted when we did not expect to collect all amounts due, including original interest accrued at the original contract rate, as a result of the restructuring, or there was a delay in payment that was more-than-insignificant. TDRs resulted from our loss mitigation activities, and included rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which were intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also resulted from borrowers that had been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and had not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us.  In those situations where principal is forgiven, the amount of such principal forgiveness was immediately charged-off.  Additionally, for periods prior to 2023, potential incremental losses or recoveries on TDRs had been factored into the ALLL estimates for each loan class under the methodologies described in this Note 1. Once a loan became a TDR, it would continue to be reported as a TDR until it was ultimately repaid in full, the collateral was foreclosed upon or it fully charged-off. PNC excluded loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option, and certain government insured or guaranteed loans from our TDR population.\nSee the following for additional information related to loans, including further discussion regarding our policies, the methodologies and significant inputs used to determine the ALLL and additional details on the composition of our loan portfolio:\n•\nNonperforming Loans and Leases section of this Note 1,\n•\nAllowance for Credit Losses section of this Note 1, and\n•\nNote 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in this Report.\n100\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nNonperforming Loans and Leases\nThe matrix that follows summarizes our policies for classifying certain loans as nonperforming loans and/or discontinuing the accrual of loan interest income.\nCommercial\nLoans classified as nonperforming and accounted for as nonaccrual\n•  Loans accounted for at amortized cost where:\n–\nThe loan is 90 days or more past due.\n–\nThe loan is rated substandard or worse due to the determination that full collection of principal and interest is not probable as demonstrated by the following conditions:\n•\nThe collection of principal or interest is 90 days or more past due,\n•\nReasonable doubt exists as to the certainty of the borrower’s future debt service ability, according to the terms of the credit arrangement, regardless of whether 90 days have passed or not,\n•\nThe borrower has filed, or will likely file for bankruptcy, and it is not probable the borrower will be able to repay contractual payments due under the loan, \n•\nThe bank advances additional funds to cover principal or interest,\n•\nWe are in the process of liquidating a commercial borrower, or\n•\nWe are pursuing remedies under a guarantee.\nLoans excluded from nonperforming classification but accounted for as nonaccrual\n•  Loans accounted for under the fair value option and full collection of principal and interest is not probable.\n•  Loans accounted for at the lower of cost or market less costs to sell (held for sale) and full collection of\n   principal and interest is not probable.\nLoans excluded from nonperforming classification and nonaccrual accounting\n•  Loans that are well secured and in the process of collection.\n•\n Certain government insured or guaranteed loans where substantially all principal and interest is insured.\n•\n Commercial purchasing card assets that do not accrue interest.\nConsumer\nLoans classified as nonperforming and accounted for as nonaccrual\n•  Loans accounted for at amortized cost where full collection of contractual principal and interest is not \n   deemed probable as demonstrated in the policies below:\n–  The loan is 90 days past due for home equity and installment loans, and 180 days past due for well-\n    secured residential real estate loans,\n–  The loan had been modified and classified as a TDR prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02,\n–  The loan has been modified due to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty and is not government\n    insured or guaranteed,\n–  The loan has been modified to defer prior payments in forbearance to the end of the loan term,\n–  Notification of bankruptcy has been received,\n–  The bank holds a subordinate lien position in the loan and the first lien mortgage loan is seriously\n    stressed (\ni.e.\n, 90 days or more past due),\n–  Other loans within the same borrower relationship have been placed on nonaccrual or charge-offs have\n    been taken on them,\n–  The bank has ordered the repossession of non-real estate collateral securing the loan, or\n–  The bank has charged-off the loan to the value of the collateral.\nLoans excluded from nonperforming classification but accounted for as nonaccrual\n•  Loans accounted for under the fair value option and full collection of principal and interest is not probable.\n•  Loans accounted for at the lower of cost or market less costs to sell (held for sale) and full collection of\n   principal and interest is not probable.\nLoans excluded from nonperforming classification and nonaccrual accounting\n•\n Certain government insured or guaranteed loans where substantially all principal and interest is insured.\n•  Residential real estate loans that are well secured and in the process of collection.\n•  Consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by residential real estate or automobiles, as permitted by\n   regulatory guidance.\nAccounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases and Other Nonaccrual Loans\nFor nonaccrual loans, interest income accrual and deferred fee/cost recognition is discontinued. Additionally, depending on whether the accrued interest has been incorporated into the ACL estimates, as discussed in the Accrued Interest section of this Note 1, the accrued and uncollected interest is either reversed through net interest income (if a CECL reserve is not maintained for accrued interest) or charged-off against the allowance (if a CECL reserve is maintained for accrued interest), except for credit cards, where we reverse any accrued interest through net interest income at the time of a charge-off, as per industry standard practice. Nonaccrual loans that are also collateral dependent may be charged-off to reduce the basis to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell.\nIf payment is received on a nonaccrual loan, generally the payment is first applied to the remaining principal balance. Payments are then applied to recover any charged-off amounts related to the loan. Finally, if both the principal balance and any charge-offs have been recovered, then the payment will be recorded as interest income. For certain consumer loans, the receipt of interest payments is recognized as interest income on a cash basis. Cash basis income recognition is applied if a loan’s amortized cost basis is deemed fully collectible and the loan has performed for at least six months. \nFor TDRs prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, payments were applied based upon their contractual terms unless the related loan was deemed non-performing. TDRs were generally included in nonperforming and nonaccrual loans. However, after a reasonable period of time, generally six months, in which the loan performed under restructured terms and met other performance indicators, it was returned to performing/accruing status. TDRs resulting from (i) borrowers that had been discharged from personal liability \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n101\n \nthrough Chapter 7 bankruptcy and had not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us, and (ii) borrowers that were not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms were not returned to accruing status.\nFor FDMs, payments are applied based upon their contractual terms unless the related loan is deemed nonperforming. Consumer loans modified due to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are generally included in nonperforming and nonaccrual loans if they are not government insured or guaranteed. Commercial loans modified due to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may be included in nonperforming and nonaccrual loans, subject to the bank’s policies for nonperforming loans and leases.  FDMs may remain on accruing status if the bank expects to collect all contractual principal and interest due under the loan and the borrower remains current. Collateral coverage, guarantor and/or sponsor support and debt service coverage are factors that may be considered in the accruing status of an FDM loan. FDM loans classified as nonperforming and nonaccrual loans may return to accruing status after a reasonable period of time, generally six months, in which the loan performs under modified terms and meets other performance indicators. This return to accruing status demonstrates that the bank expects to collect all of the loan’s remaining contractual principal and interest. Loan modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulting from (i) borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us, and (ii) borrowers that are not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the modified terms are not returned to accrual status.\nOther nonaccrual loans are generally not returned to accruing status until the borrower has performed in accordance with the loan’s contractual terms and other performance indicators for at least six months, the period of time which was determined to demonstrate the expected collectability of the loan’s remaining contractual principal and interest. Nonaccrual loans with partially charged-off principal may return to accruing status if the loan performs after a reasonable period of time, generally six months, and the loan meets other performance indicators. When a nonperforming loan is returned to accruing status, it is then considered a performing loan. Nonaccrual loans with fully charged-off principal are prohibited from returning to accruing status.  \nForeclosed assets consist of any asset seized or property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. OREO comprises principally residential and commercial real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. After obtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some jurisdictions the initiation of proceedings under a power of sale in the loan instruments, the property will be sold. When we are awarded title or completion of deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, we transfer the loan to foreclosed assets included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is initially recorded at estimated fair value less cost to sell. Based upon the estimated fair value less cost to sell, the amortized cost basis of the loan is adjusted and a charge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL. We estimate fair values primarily based on appraisals or sales agreements with third parties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are valued at the lower of the amount recorded at the acquisition date or estimated fair value less cost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these assets and gains or losses realized from disposition of such property are reflected in Other noninterest expense.\nFor certain mortgage loans that have a government guarantee, we establish a separate other receivable upon foreclosure. The receivable is measured based on the loan balance (inclusive of principal and interest) that is expected to be recovered from the guarantor.\nCharge-offs \nWe generally charge-off commercial (commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and equipment lease financing) nonperforming loans when we determine that a specific loan, or portion thereof, is uncollectible. This determination is based on the specific facts and circumstances of the individual loans. In making this determination, we consider the viability of the business or project as a going concern, the past due status when the asset is not well secured, the expected cash flows to repay the loan, the value of the collateral less costs to sell, and the ability and willingness of any guarantors to perform. For commercial loans and leases less than a defined dollar threshold, balances are generally charged-off in full after 180 days for loans and 120 days for leases.  \nWe generally charge-off secured consumer (home equity, residential real estate and automobile) nonperforming loans to the fair\nvalue of collateral less costs to sell if the fair value is lower than the amortized cost basis of the loan outstanding and the delinquency of the loan, combined with other risk factors such as bankruptcy or lien position, indicates that the loan (or a portion thereof) is uncollectible as per our historical experience. These nonperforming loans would also be charged-off when the collateral has been repossessed. We charge-off secured consumer loans no later than 180 days past due. Most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by automobiles or residential real estate, are charged-off once they have reached 120-180 days past due. \nDepending on the class of financing receivable, we may use a combination of internal and external valuation sources in determining the value of collateral. Our use of these valuation techniques is dependent upon the collateral securing the loan, which varies by loan class, as explained below. \n102\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nFor commercial and industrial loans, common forms of collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-occupied real estate and other business assets. Depending on the size of the loan and composition of the collateral pool, we may require an appraisal or, depending on the type of collateral, a field examination at loan origination. For loans with an identified weakness and other characteristics as demonstrated by our internal classifications and policies, the frequency of appraisal updates is specific to collateral type and size of loan. These appraisal updates aid in determining the timing and amount of a charge-off, if deemed necessary. For loans secured by machinery and equipment, an orderly liquidation value appraisal is required bi-annually while the loan continues to demonstrate weakness. In the off year, we obtain desktop appraisal values which may be informed from internal analytics. For loans secured by inventory or accounts receivable, we require an appraisal or a field examination annually while the loan continues to demonstrate weakness.  Refer to the discussion that follows for appraisal requirements related to loans secured by real estate. \nFor commercial real estate loans, collateral generally includes land and/or buildings that are used to generate income for the borrower, which we assign a value to through use of appraisals performed by qualified, independent third-party state certified real estate appraisers. New loans or loans being evaluated for extension or material modification are required to be appraised. The frequency of reappraisals outside of a credit action is based on regulatory and internal requirements. Generally, for loans with heightened risk, a cadence has been established to obtain updated appraisals at least annually to aid in determining the timing and amount of a charge-off, if deemed necessary. Loans that do not demonstrate a heightened risk are monitored through our ongoing management of the portfolio, including any need for a new appraisal. All appraisals are reviewed by independent qualified real estate valuation personnel. Depending on the specific circumstances of the property at the time of appraisal, we may use one, or a combination of as-is, as-completed, or as-stabilized appraisals. \nFor residential real estate and certain home equity loans, where collateral typically includes the property securing the loan or line-of-credit, PNC obtains appraisals and evaluations through independent appraisal management companies at the time of loan application, in accordance with regulatory guidelines. We use internally derived property values based on vendor automated valuation models or HPI indices to monitor value trends since the time of loan origination, which we update monthly. We obtain broker price opinions when foreclosure proceedings are initiated and order independent appraisals for loans that we have foreclosed on to aid in determining the timing and amount of a charge-off. Residential real estate appraisals are subject to GSE and regulatory (e.g., Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice) appraisal standards. In addition to utilizing GSE appraisal standards, home equity loans may use third-party proprietary appraisal standards which also meet regulatory requirements, or may undergo an evaluation process as an alternative to an appraisal. Residential real estate and home equity loans generally use an as-is appraisal valuation.   \nFor secured collateral dependent loans, collateral values are updated at least annually and subsequent declines in collateral values are charged-off, resulting in incremental provision for credit loss. Subsequent increases in collateral values may be reflected as an adjustment to the ALLL to reflect the expectation of recoveries in an amount greater than previously expected, limited to amounts previously charged-off.\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on FDMs, nonperforming assets and credit quality indicators related to our loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL is based on historical loss experience, current borrower risk characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. We maintain the ACL at an appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures as of the balance sheet date. The remaining contractual term of assets in scope of CECL is estimated considering contractual maturity dates, prepayment expectations, utilization or draw expectations and any contractually embedded extension options that do not allow us to unilaterally cancel the extension options. For products without a fixed contractual maturity date (\ne.g\n., credit cards), we rely on historical payment behavior to determine the effective tenor of the exposure.\nWe estimate expected losses on a pooled basis using a combination of (i) the expected losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) a period of reversion to long-run average expected losses, where applicable and (iii) the long-run average expected losses for the remaining estimated contractual term. For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments in the scope of CECL, the ACL also includes individually assessed reserves and qualitative reserves, as applicable.\nWe use forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses for our reasonable and supportable forecast period. For this purpose, we use forecasted scenarios produced by PNC’s Economics Team, which are designed to reflect potential trajectories of the business cycles and their related estimated probabilities. The forecast length that we have currently determined to be reasonable and supportable is three years. As noted in the methodology discussions that follow, forward-looking information is incorporated into the \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n103\n \nexpected credit loss estimates. Such forward-looking information includes forecasted relevant macroeconomic variables, which are estimated using quantitative macroeconomic models, analysis from PNC economists and management judgment.\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period and the long-run average expected credit losses. We consider a number of factors in determining the duration of the reversion period, such as contractual maturity of the asset, observed historical patterns and the estimated credit loss rates at the end of the forecast period relative to the beginning of the long-run average period. The reversion period ranges from immediate to three years.\nThe long-run average expected credit losses are derived from long-run historical credit loss information adjusted for the credit quality of the current portfolio and, therefore, do not consider current and forecasted economic conditions.\nAllowance for Investment Securities\nA significant portion of our investment securities are issued or guaranteed by either the U.S. government (U.S. Treasury or a government entity) or a GSE (FNMA or FHLMC). Taking into consideration historical information and current and forecasted conditions, we do not expect to incur any credit losses on these securities.\nInvestment securities that are not issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or a GSE consist of both securitized products, such as non-agency mortgage and asset-backed securities, as well as non-securitized products, such as corporate and municipal debt securities. A discounted cash flow approach is primarily used to determine the amount of the allowance required. The estimates of expected cash flows are determined using macroeconomic sensitive models taking into consideration the reasonable and supportable forecast period and scenarios discussed above. Additional factors unique to a specific security may also be taken into consideration when estimating expected cash flows. The cash flows expected to be collected, after considering expected prepayments, are discounted at the effective interest rate. For an available-for-sale security, the amount of the allowance is limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its estimated fair value.\nSee Note 2 Investment Securities for additional information about the investment securities portfolio.\n104\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nOur pooled expected credit loss methodology is based upon the quantification of risk parameters, such as PD, LGD, EAD and the remaining estimated contractual term for a loan, loan segment or lease. We also consider the impact of prepayments and amortization on the estimated contractual term in our expected loss estimates. We use historical credit loss information, current borrower risk characteristics and forecasted economic variables for the reasonable and supportable forecast period, coupled with analytical methods, to estimate these risk parameters by loan, loan segment or lease. PD, LGD and EAD parameters are calculated for each forecasted scenario and the long-run average period, and are combined to generate expected loss estimates by scenario. Each scenario is then weighted to determine our total estimated loss. \nThe following matrix provides key credit risk characteristics that we use to estimate these risk parameters. \n \nLoan Class\nProbability of Default\nLoss Given Default\nExposure at Default\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial / Equipment lease financing\n•\nFor wholesale obligors: internal risk ratings based on borrower characteristics and industry\n•\nFor retail small balance obligors: credit score, delinquency status, and product type\n•\nCollateral type, LTV, industry, size and outstanding exposure for secured loans\n•\nCapital structure, industry and size for unsecured loans\n•\nFor retail small balance obligors, product type and credit scores\n•\nOutstanding balances, commitment, contractual maturities and historical prepayment experience for loans\n•\nCurrent utilization and historical pre-default draw experience for lines\nCommercial real estate (CRE)\n•\nProperty performance metrics, property type, market and risk pool and internal risk ratings based on borrower characteristics\n•\nProperty type, LTV, market, risk pool and costs to sell\n•\nOutstanding balances, commitment, contractual maturities and historical prepayment experience for loans\nConsumer\nHome equity / Residential real estate\n•\nBorrower credit scores, delinquency status, origination vintage, LTV and contractual maturity\n•\nCollateral characteristics, LTV and costs to sell\n•\nOutstanding balances, contractual maturities and historical prepayment experience for loans\n•\nCurrent utilization and historical pre-default draw experience for lines\nAutomobile\n•\nBorrower credit scores, delinquency status, borrower income, LTV and contractual maturity\n•\nNew vs. used, LTV and borrower credit scores\n•\nOutstanding balances, contractual maturities and historical prepayment experience\nCredit card\n•\nBorrower credit scores, delinquency status, utilization, payment behavior and months on book\n•\nBorrower credit scores and credit line amount\n•\nPaydown curves are developed using a pro-rata method and estimated using borrower behavior segments, payment ratios and borrower credit scores\nEducation / Other consumer\n•\nModeled using either discrete risk parameters or analytical approaches based on net charge-offs and paydown rates\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n105\n \nThe following matrix describes the key economic variables that are consumed during our forecast period by loan class, as well as other assumptions that are used for our reversion and long-run average approaches.                                                                                                        \nLoan Class\nForecast Period - Key Economic Variables\nReversion Method\nLong-Run Average\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial / Equipment lease financing\n•\nGDP and Gross Domestic Investment measures, employment related variables and personal income and consumption measures \n•\nImmediate reversion\n•\nAverage parameters determined based on internal and external historical data\n•\nModeled parameters using long-run economic conditions for retail small balance obligors\nCommercial real estate (CRE)\n• CRE Price Index, unemployment rates, GDP, corporate bond yield and interest rates\n• Immediate reversion\n• Average parameters determined based on internal and external historical data\nConsumer\nHome equity / Residential real estate\n•\nUnemployment rates, HPI and interest rates\n•\nStraight-line over 3 years\n•\nModeled parameters using long-run economic conditions\nAutomobile\n•\nUnemployment rates, HPI, disposable personal income and Manheim used car index\n•\nStraight-line over 1 year\n•\nAverage parameters determined based on internal historical data\nCredit card\n•\nUnemployment rates, personal consumption expenditure and HPI\n•\nStraight-line over 2 years\n•\nModeled parameters using long-run economic conditions\nEducation / Other consumer\n•\nModeled using either discrete risk parameters or analytical approaches based on net charge-offs and paydown rates\nAfter the forecast period, we revert to the long-run average over the reversion period noted above, which is the period between the end of the forecast period and when losses are estimated to have completely reverted to the long-run average.\nOnce we have developed a combined estimate of credit losses (\ni.e.\n, for the forecast period, reversion period and long-run average) under each of the forecasted scenarios, we produce a probability-weighted credit loss estimate. In addition, we add or deduct any qualitative components and other adjustments, such as individually assessed loans, to produce the ALLL. See the Individually Assessed Component and Qualitative Component discussions that follow in this Note 1 for additional information about those adjustments.\nIndividually Assessed Component\nLoans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans are individually assessed as follows:\n•\nFor commercial nonperforming loans greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold, reserves are based on an analysis of the present value of the loan’s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral, if appropriate under our policy for collateral dependent loans. Nonperforming commercial loans below the defined threshold are reserved for under a pooled basis, as we believe these loans continue to share similar risk characteristics.\n•\nFor consumer nonperforming loans classified as collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL related to recovery of amounts previously charged-off are evaluated through an analysis of the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.\nQualitative Component\nWhile our reserve models and methodologies strive to reflect all relevant expected credit risk factors, the ACL also accounts for factors that may not be directly measured in the determination of individually assessed or pooled reserves. Such qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to:\n•\nIndustry concentrations and conditions, \n•\nChanges in market conditions, including regulatory and legal requirements,\n•\nChanges in the nature and volume of our portfolio,\n•\nRecent credit quality trends, \n•\nRecent loss experience in particular portfolios, including specific and unique events,\n•\nRecent macroeconomic factors that may not be reflected in the forecast information,\n•\nLimitations of available input data, including historical loss information and recent data such as collateral values,\n•\nModel imprecision and limitations,\n•\nChanges in lending policies and procedures, including changes in loss recognition and mitigation policies and procedures, and\n•\nTiming of available information.\n106\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information about our loan portfolio and the related allowance.\nAccrued Interest\nWhen accrued interest is reversed or charged-off in a timely manner, the CECL standard provides a practical expedient to exclude\naccrued interest from ACL measurement. We consider our nonaccrual and charge-off policies to be timely for all of our investment\nsecurities, loans and leases, with the exception of consumer credit cards, education loans and certain unsecured consumer lines of credit. We consider the length of time before nonaccrual/charge-off and the use of appropriate other triggering events for nonaccrual and charge-offs in making this determination. Pursuant to these policy elections, we calculate reserves for accrued interest on credit cards, education loans and certain unsecured consumer lines of credit, which are then included within the ALLL. See the Debt Securities and the Nonperforming Loans and Leases sections of this Note 1 for additional information on our nonaccrual and charge-off policies.\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans or Securities\nThe allowance for PCD loans or securities is determined at the time of acquisition, as the estimated expected credit loss of the outstanding balance or par value,\n \nbased on the methodologies described previously for loans and securities. In accordance with CECL, the allowance recognized at acquisition is added to the acquisition date purchase price to determine the asset’s amortized cost basis.\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related Commitments \nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures that are not unconditionally cancelable (\ne.g.\n, unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit and certain financial guarantees), at a level we believe is appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on these exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this reserve is estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for pooled loans and leases. See the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses section of this Note 1 for the key credit risk characteristics for unfunded lending related commitments. The allowance for unfunded lending related commitments is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to this reserve are included in Provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nSee Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information about this allowance.\nAllowance for Other Financial Assets\nWe determine the allowance for other financial assets (\ne.g.\n, trade receivables, servicing advances on PNC-owned loans and balances with banks) considering historical loss information and other available indicators. In certain cases where there are no historical, current or forecast indicators of an expected credit loss, we may estimate the reserve to be close to zero. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the allowance for other financial assets was immaterial.\nLoans Held for Sale\nWe designate loans as held for sale when we have the intent and ability to sell them. At the time of designation to held for sale, any ACL is reversed, and a valuation allowance for the shortfall between the amortized cost basis and the net realizable value is recognized, excluding the amounts already charged-off. Similarly, when loans are no longer considered held for sale, the valuation allowance (net of writedowns) is reversed, and an allowance for credit losses is established, excluding the amounts already charged-off. Write-downs on loans held for sale (if required) are recorded as charge-offs through the valuation allowance. Adjustments to the valuation allowance on held for sale loans are recognized in Other noninterest income.\nWe have elected to account for certain commercial and residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. The changes in the fair value of commercial and residential mortgage loans are measured and recorded within Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income each period. See Note 14 Fair Value for additional information.\nInterest income with respect to loans held for sale is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and the loan’s contractual interest rate.\nIn certain circumstances, loans designated as held for sale may be transferred to held for investment based on a change in strategy. We transfer these loans at the lower of cost or estimated fair value; however, any loans originated or purchased for the held for sale portfolio and for which the fair value option has been elected remain at fair value for the life of the loan.\nLoan Sales, Loan Securitizations and Retained Interests\nWe recognize the sale of loans or other financial assets when the transferred assets are legally isolated from our creditors and the appropriate accounting criteria are met. We have sold mortgage and other loans through securitization transactions. In a securitization, financial assets are transferred into trusts or to SPEs in transactions to effectively legally isolate the assets from us.\nIn a securitization, the trust or SPE issues beneficial interests in the form of senior and subordinated securities backed or collateralized by the assets sold to the trust. The senior classes of the asset-backed securities typically receive investment grade credit ratings at the \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n107\n \ntime of issuance. These ratings are generally achieved through the creation of lower-rated subordinated classes of asset-backed securities, as well as subordinated or residual interests. In certain cases, we may retain a portion or all of the securities issued, interest-only strips, one or more subordinated tranches, servicing rights and, in some cases, cash reserve accounts. If sale accounting is achieved, securitized loans are removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in Noninterest income at the time of initial sale. Gains or losses recognized on the sale of the loans depend on the fair value of the loans sold and the retained interests at the date of sale. We generally estimate the fair value of the retained interests based on the present value of future expected cash flows using assumptions as to discount rates, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit losses and servicing costs, if applicable.\nWith the exception of loan sales to certain GSEs, our loan sales and securitizations are generally structured without recourse to us except for representations and warranties and with no restrictions on the retained interests. We originate, sell and service commercial mortgage loans under the FNMA DUS program. Under the provisions of the DUS program, we participate in a loss-sharing arrangement with FNMA. When we are obligated for loss-sharing or recourse, our policy is to record such liabilities initially at fair value and subsequently reserve for estimated losses in accordance with guidance contained in applicable GAAP.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets generally that either:\n•\nDoes not have equity investors with voting rights that can directly or indirectly make decisions about the entity’s most significant economic activities through those voting rights or similar rights, or\n•\nHas equity investors that do not provide sufficient equity for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.\nA VIE often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property.\nVIEs are assessed for consolidation under ASC 810 – \nConsolidation\n when we hold a variable interest in these entities. We consolidate a VIE if we are its primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Upon consolidation of a VIE, we recognize all of the VIE’s assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. On a quarterly basis, we determine whether any changes occurred requiring a reassessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of an entity.\nSee Note 4 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities for information about VIEs that we consolidate as well as those that we do not consolidate but in which we hold a significant variable interest.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe provide servicing under various loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential loans. These contracts are either purchased in the open market or retained as part of a loan securitization or loan sale. All acquired or originated servicing rights are initially measured at fair value. Fair value is based on the present value of the expected future net cash flows, including assumptions as to:\n•\nDeposit balances and interest rates for escrow and commercial reserve earnings,\n•\nDiscount rates,\n•\nEstimated prepayment speeds, and\n•\nEstimated servicing costs.\nWe’ve elected to subsequently measure commercial and residential MSRs at fair value. We manage the risk of changes in fair value of MSRs by hedging the fair value with derivatives and securities which are expected to offset the change in fair value of the servicing rights. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recognized as gains/(losses). The fair value of these servicing rights is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs and other factors which are determined based on current market conditions. \nSee Note 5 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights and Note 14 Fair Value for additional information.\n \nGoodwill\n \nGoodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Goodwill is assigned at the reporting unit level on the acquisition date. A reporting unit is a business segment or\none level below a business segment. At least annually, in the fourth quarter, management performs the goodwill impairment test at a reporting unit level. The goodwill impairment test may also be performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date, when such events or circumstances may indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the \n108\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nfair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Examples of events or circumstances that are considered for more frequent goodwill impairment testing include, but are not limited to, changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and other relevant PNC or reporting unit specific events.\nWhen performing a goodwill impairment test, PNC may first perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after considering all relevant events and circumstances, PNC determines it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If PNC elects to bypass the qualitative analysis, or concludes via qualitative analysis that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. Inputs are generated and used in calculating the fair value of the reporting unit, which is compared to its carrying amount. The fair value of our reporting units is determined by using discounted cash flows and/or market comparability methodologies. If the fair value is greater than the carrying amount, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are not permitted. \nSee Note 5 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights for additional information.\n \nLeases\nLessor Arrangements\nWe provide financing for various types of equipment, including aircraft, energy and power systems and vehicles through a variety of lease arrangements. Finance leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased equipment, less unearned income. Leveraged leases, a form of financing leases, are carried net of nonrecourse debt. We recognize income over the term of the lease using the constant effective yield method. Lease residual values are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Gains or losses on the sale of leased assets are included in Other noninterest income. Valuation adjustments on operating lease residuals are included in Other noninterest expense while valuation adjustments on the net investment of a direct financing or sales-type lease are included in Provision for credit losses.\n \nLessee Arrangements\nWe lease retail branches, datacenters, office space, land and equipment under operating and finance leases. Under ASC 842, we elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and nonlease components of real estate leases and leases of advertising assets, such as signage, as a single lease component. For other leased asset classes, lease and nonlease components of new lease agreements are accounted for separately. In addition, we elected the practical expedient to not apply the recognition requirements under the standard to short-term leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, as we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, we have elected to use the Overnight Indexed Swap rate corresponding to the term of the lease at the lease measurement date as our incremental borrowing rate to measure the right-of-use-asset and lease liability. \nSee Note 6 Leases for additional information on our leasing arrangements.\n \nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor financial reporting purposes, we depreciate premises and equipment, net of salvage value, principally using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.\nWe use estimated useful lives for furniture and equipment ranging from \none\n to \n10\n years and depreciate buildings over an estimated useful life of up to \n40\n years. We amortize leasehold improvements over their estimated useful lives of up to \n15\n years or the respective lease terms, whichever is shorter.\nWe purchase, as well as internally develop and customize, certain software to enhance or perform internal business functions. Software development costs incurred in the planning and post-development project stages are charged to Noninterest expense. Costs associated with designing software configuration and interfaces, installation, coding programs and testing systems are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over periods generally ranging from \none\n to \n10\n years. Implementation costs of software hosting arrangements are capitalized and amortized over the contractual term of the associated arrangement, including extension options we are reasonably certain to exercise, on a straight-line basis. \nWe review the remaining useful lives and carrying values of premises and equipment to determine whether an event has occurred that would indicate a change in useful life is warranted or if any impairment exists.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n109\n \nOther Comprehensive Income\nOther comprehensive income, on an after-tax basis, primarily consists of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale debt securities, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and changes in plan assets and benefit obligations of pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Details of each component are included in Note 12 Other Comprehensive Income.\nTreasury Stock\nWe record common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on the first-in, first-out basis.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated using the two-class method to determine income attributable to common shareholders. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities under the two-class method. Distributed dividends and dividend equivalents related to participating securities and an allocation of undistributed net income to participating securities reduce the amount of income attributable to common shareholders. In a period with a loss, no allocation will be made to the participating securities, as they do not have a contractual obligation to absorb losses. Income attributable to common shareholders is then divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period.\nDiluted earnings per common share is calculated under the more dilutive of either the treasury stock method or the two-class method. For the diluted calculation, we increase the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding by the assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock from the beginning of the year or date of issuance, if later, and the number of shares of common stock that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options and warrants and the issuance of incentive shares using the treasury stock method. These adjustments to the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding are made only when such adjustments will dilute earnings per common share. For periods in which there is a loss from continuing operations, any potential dilutive shares will be anti-dilutive. In this scenario, no potential dilutive shares will be included in the continuing operations, discontinued operations or total earnings per common share calculations, even if overall net income is reported. \nSee Note 13 Earnings Per Share for additional information.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of financial instruments and the methods and assumptions used in estimating fair value amounts and financial assets and liabilities for which fair value was elected are detailed in Note 14 Fair Value.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives to both mitigate exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit risks inherent in our business activities, as well as to facilitate customer risk management activities. We manage these risks as part of our asset and liability management process and through credit policies and procedures.\nWe recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related cash flows in the Operating Activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Adjustments for counterparty credit risk are included in the determination of fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a cash flow or net investment hedging relationship. For all other derivatives, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nWe utilize a net presentation for derivative instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative exposures by offsetting obligations to return, or general rights to reclaim, cash collateral against the fair values of the net derivatives being collateralized.\nFor those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, we designate the hedging instrument, based on the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.\nWe formally document the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy, before undertaking an accounting hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivatives and related hedged items must be designated as a hedge at inception of the hedge relationship. In addition, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. For accounting hedge relationships, we formally assess, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, if the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting designated changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. We assess \n110\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \neffectiveness using statistical regression analysis. Where the critical terms of the derivative and hedged item match, effectiveness may be assessed qualitatively.\nFor derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges (\ni.e\n., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability attributable to a particular risk, such as changes in benchmark interest rates), changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings and offset by also recognizing in earnings the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. To the extent the change in fair value of the derivative does not offset the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, the difference is reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same income statement line as the hedged item.\nFor derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (\ni.e\n., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the gain or loss on derivatives is reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to income in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect earnings and recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged cash flows. For derivatives designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign operation, the gain or loss on the derivatives is reported as a component of AOCI.\nWe discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that the derivative (i) no longer qualifies as an effective hedge; (ii) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; or (iii) the derivative is de-designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge or, for a cash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period. \nWe purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. For financial instruments not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, we assess, at inception of the transaction, if the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would be a derivative. If the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host contract and meets the definition of a derivative, the embedded derivative is recorded separately from the host contract with changes in fair value recorded in earnings, unless we elect to account for the hybrid instrument at fair value.\nWe enter into commitments to originate residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale. We also enter into commitments to purchase or sell commercial and residential real estate loans. These commitments are accounted for as free-standing derivatives which are recorded at fair value in Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any gain or loss from the change in fair value after the inception of the commitment is recognized in Noninterest income. \nSee Note 15 Financial Derivatives for additional information.\n \nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will apply at the time when we believe the differences will reverse. Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. Thus, at the enactment date, deferred taxes are remeasured and the change is recognized in Income tax expense. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires an assessment to determine the realization of such assets. Realization refers to the incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or refunds receivable from the deferred tax assets, assuming that the underlying deductible differences and carryforwards are the last items to enter into the determination of future taxable income. We establish a valuation allowance for tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized, based upon all available positive and negative evidence.\nWe have elected to apply the proportional amortization method to our qualifying LIHTC and NMTC equity investments. Investment tax credits and investment impairment are recognized in tax expense for any individual LIHTC and NMTC equity investment for which we can demonstrate that the investment was made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and other income tax benefits. We use the deferral method of accounting for all investment tax credit equity investments. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to the related asset.\nSee Note 18 Income Taxes for additional information.\n \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n111\n \nRevenue Recognition\nWe earn interest and noninterest income from various sources, including:\n•\nLending,\n•\nSecurities portfolio,\n•\nAsset management,\n•\nLoan sales, loan securitizations and servicing,\n•\nBrokerage services,\n•\nSale of securities,\n•\nCertain private equity activities, and\n•\nSale of interest-rate and foreign currency derivatives.\nIn addition, we earn fees and commissions from:\n•\nIssuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees,\n•\nDeposit account services,\n•\nMerchant services,\n•\nSelling various insurance products,\n•\nProviding treasury management services including money transfer services,\n•\nProviding merger and acquisition advisory and related services,\n•\nDebit and credit card transactions, and\n•\nFacilitating and participating in certain capital markets transactions.\nService charges on deposit accounts are recognized when earned. Brokerage fees and gains and losses on the sale of securities and certain derivatives are recognized on a trade-date basis.\nWe record private equity income or loss based on changes in the valuation of the underlying investments or when we dispose of our interest.\nWe recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments where we have elected the fair value option. These financial instruments include certain commercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale, certain residential mortgage portfolio loans and resale agreements. We also recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of residential and commercial MSRs.\nWe recognize revenue from servicing residential and commercial mortgages for others as earned based on the specific contractual terms. These revenues are reported on the Consolidated Income Statement in the line item Residential and commercial mortgage. We recognize revenue from securities, derivatives and foreign exchange customer-related trading, as well as securities underwriting activities, as these transactions occur or as performance obligations are met. We generally recognize gains from the sale of loans upon meeting the derecognition criteria for transfers of financial assets. Mortgage revenue recognized is reported net of mortgage repurchase reserves.\nFor the fee-based revenue within the scope of ASC Topic 606 - \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, revenue is recognized when or as those services are transferred to the customer. See Note 23 Fee-based Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional information related to revenue within the scope of ASC Topic 606.\nNoninterest Income Presentation\nA description of each revenue stream follows:\nAsset management and brokerage\n includes revenue from our asset management and retail brokerage businesses.

In addition, potential sources of ineffectiveness as a result of reference rate reform may be disregarded when performing some effectiveness assessments. \n• Includes optional expedients and exceptions for contract modifications and hedge accounting that apply to derivative instruments impacted by the market-wide discounting transition. \n• Guidance in these ASUs is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024.\n • ASU 2020-04 was adopted March 12, 2020. ASU 2021-01 was retrospectively adopted October 1, 2020. ASU 2022-06 was adopted upon issuance.\n• During the fourth quarter of 2020, we elected to apply certain optional expedients for contract modifications and hedging relationships to derivative instruments impacted by the market-wide discounting transition. These optional expedients remove the requirement to remeasure contract modifications or dedesignate hedging relationships due to reference rate reform. The elections made in the fourth quarter of 2020 apply only to derivative instruments impacted by the market-wide discounting transition, not all derivative instruments.\n• During the first quarter of 2021, we elected to apply certain optional expedients to derivative instruments that were modified in the first quarter due to the adoption of fallback language recommended by the ISDA to address the anticipated cessation of LIBOR. These optional expedients remove the requirement to remeasure contract modifications or dedesignate hedging relationships due to reference rate reform. We applied these optional expedients consistently to all eligible LIBOR cessation-related contract modifications and hedging relationships since election.\n• During the fourth quarter of 2021, we elected to apply certain optional expedients for contract modifications to receivables modified in the fourth quarter due to the cessation of 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR tenors and non-USD Interbank Offered Rates. These optional expedients remove the requirement to assess whether the contract modification was more-than-minor in accordance with ASC 310. We also elected to apply certain optional expedients related to assessing hedge effectiveness to our cash flow hedge relationships affected by reference rate reform. We applied these optional expedients consistently to all eligible LIBOR cessation-related contract modifications and hedging relationships since election.\n• During the second quarter of 2023, we elected and applied certain optional expedients for contract modifications and hedging relationships impacted by the central clearing counterparties conversion processes for LIBOR-indexed derivative instruments. These optional expedients remove the requirement to remeasure contract modifications or dedesignate hedging relationships due to reference rate reform. The elections made apply only to derivatives instruments impacted by the central clearinghouse conversion process.\n• During the second quarter of 2023, we applied certain optional expedients for investment security, debt and preferred stock instrument contract modifications impacted by LIBOR cessation. These optional expedients remove the requirement to remeasure contract modifications.\n • We did not elect any additional optional expedients for contract modifications and hedge relationships affected by reference rate reform before the expiration of this guidance on December 31, 2024.\n114\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nAccounting Standards Update\nDescription\nFinancial Statement Impact\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures - ASU 2023-07\nIssued November 2023\n• Requires that a public entity disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss.\n• Requires that a public entity disclose an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition.\n• Requires that a public entity provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by ASC 280 in interim periods.\n• Clarifies that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public entity may report one or more of those additional measures of segment profit.\n• Requires that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.\n• Requires a retrospective transition approach for all prior periods presented in the financial statements.\n• Adopted for annual periods beginning in 2024 and interim periods beginning in the first quarter of 2025, using a retrospective transition approach.\n• The presentation of our business segment results has been updated to reflect significant segment-level expense information and can be found within Note 22 Segment Reporting.\n• This ASU did not impact our Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows or Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n115\n \nN\nOTE\n 2 \nI\nNVESTMENT \nS\nECURITIES\nThe following table summarizes our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios by major security type:\nTable 43: Investment Securities Summary (a)(b)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nIn millions\nAmortized\nCost (c)\nUnrealized\nFair\nValue\nAmortized\nCost (c)\nUnrealized\nFair\nValue\nGains\nLosses\nGains\nLosses\nSecurities Available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\n$\n23,962\n \n$\n25\n \n$\n(\n436\n)\n$\n23,551\n \n$\n7,596\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n(\n667\n)\n$\n6,951\n \nResidential mortgage-backed\nAgency\n33,589\n \n28\n \n(\n2,991\n)\n30,626\n \n30,643\n \n46\n \n(\n2,809\n)\n27,880\n \nNon-agency\n504\n \n105\n \n(\n6\n)\n603\n \n585\n \n118\n \n(\n7\n)\n696\n \nCommercial mortgage-backed\nAgency\n2,077\n \n1\n \n(\n133\n)\n1,945\n \n1,680\n \n1\n \n(\n135\n)\n1,546\n \nNon-agency\n706\n \n \n(\n15\n)\n691\n \n913\n \n1\n \n(\n45\n)\n869\n \nAsset-backed\n2,353\n \n42\n \n(\n3\n)\n2,392\n \n1,092\n \n25\n \n(\n1\n)\n1,116\n \nOther\n2,307\n \n42\n \n(\n118\n)\n2,231\n \n2,844\n \n44\n \n(\n161\n)\n2,727\n \nTotal securities available-for-sale \n$\n65,498\n \n$\n243\n \n$\n(\n3,702\n)\n$\n62,039\n \n$\n45,353\n \n$\n257\n \n$\n(\n3,825\n)\n$\n41,785\n \nSecurities Held-to-Maturity\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\n$\n29,420\n \n \n$\n(\n896\n)\n$\n28,524\n \n$\n36,529\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n(\n1,141\n)\n$\n35,397\n \nResidential mortgage-backed\nAgency\n40,171\n \n$\n16\n \n(\n3,696\n)\n36,491\n \n42,686\n \n92\n \n(\n2,733\n)\n40,045\n \nNon-agency\n240\n \n \n(\n21\n)\n219\n \n259\n \n \n(\n17\n)\n242\n \nCommercial mortgage-backed\nAgency\n955\n \n3\n \n(\n28\n)\n930\n \n939\n \n9\n \n(\n23\n)\n925\n \nNon-agency\n836\n \n3\n \n(\n7\n)\n832\n \n1,373\n \n2\n \n(\n27\n)\n1,348\n \nAsset-backed\n3,380\n \n37\n \n(\n16\n)\n3,401\n \n5,890\n \n17\n \n(\n39\n)\n5,868\n \nOther\n2,691\n \n19\n \n(\n49\n)\n2,661\n \n3,108\n \n50\n \n(\n35\n)\n3,123\n \nTotal securities held-to-maturity (d)\n$\n77,693\n \n$\n78\n \n$\n(\n4,713\n)\n$\n73,058\n \n$\n90,784\n \n$\n179\n \n$\n(\n4,015\n)\n$\n86,948\n \n(a)  At December 31, 2024, the accrued interest associated with our held-to-maturity and available-for-sale portfolios totaled $\n242\n million and $\n328\n million, respectively. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $\n281\n million and $\n144\n million, respectively. These amounts are included in \nOther assets\n on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n(b)  Credit ratings represent a primary credit quality indicator used to monitor and manage credit risk. Of our total securities portfolio, \n97\n% were rated AAA/AA at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n(c)   Amortized cost is presented net of allowance of $\n86\n million for securities available-for-sale, primarily related to non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, and $\n5\n million for securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2024. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $\n86\n million and $\n6\n million, respectively. \n(d)  Held-to-maturity securities transferred from available-for-sale are included in held-to-maturity at fair value at the time of the transfer. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities included net unrealized losses of $\n3.4\n billion at December 31, 2024, related to securities transferred, which are offset in AOCI, net of tax. The comparable amount at December 31, 2023 was $\n4.2\n billion.\n \nThe fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses included in Total shareholders’ equity as AOCI, unless credit-related. Net unrealized gains and losses are determined by taking the difference between the fair value of a security and its amortized cost, net of any allowance. Securities held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, net of any allowance. Investment securities at December 31, 2024 included $\n1.2\n billion of net unsettled purchases that represent non-cash investing activity, and accordingly, are not reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The comparable amount for December 31, 2023 was less than $\n0.1\n billion.\nWe maintain the allowance for investment securities at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb\nexpected credit losses on our portfolio. As of December 31, 2024, the allowance for investment securities was $\n91\n million and\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio. The comparable amount at December 31, 2023 was $\n92\n million. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for a discussion of the methodologies used to determine the allowance for investment securities.\nAt December 31, 2024, AOCI included pretax losses of $\n275\n million from derivatives that hedged the purchase of investment securities classified as held-to-maturity. The losses will be accreted to interest income as an adjustment of yield on the securities. \n116\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nTable 44 presents the gross unrealized losses and fair value of securities available-for-sale that do not have an associated allowance for investment securities at December 31, 2024 and 2023. These securities are segregated between investments that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more, based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis. All securities included in the table have been evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. As part of that assessment, as of December 31, 2024, we concluded that we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.\nTable 44: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value of Securities Available-for-Sale Without an Allowance for Credit Losses\nUnrealized loss position\nless than 12 months\nUnrealized loss position\n12 months or more\nTotal\nIn millions\nUnrealized\nLoss\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLoss\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLoss\nFair\nValue\nDecember 31, 2024\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\n$\n(\n70\n)\n$\n17,500\n \n$\n(\n366\n)\n$\n1,824\n \n$\n(\n436\n)\n$\n19,324\n \nResidential mortgage-backed\nAgency\n(\n65\n)\n6,163\n \n(\n2,926\n)\n19,595\n \n(\n2,991\n)\n25,758\n \nNon-agency\n \n \n(\n3\n)\n41\n \n(\n3\n)\n41\n \nCommercial mortgage-backed\nAgency\n(\n8\n)\n501\n \n(\n125\n)\n1,388\n \n(\n133\n)\n1,889\n \nNon-agency\n \n \n(\n15\n)\n559\n \n(\n15\n)\n559\n \nAsset-backed\n(\n2\n)\n226\n \n(\n1\n)\n8\n \n(\n3\n)\n234\n \nOther\n(\n2\n)\n99\n \n(\n98\n)\n1,734\n \n(\n100\n)\n1,833\n \nTotal securities available-for-sale\n$\n(\n147\n)\n$\n24,489\n \n$\n(\n3,534\n)\n$\n25,149\n \n$\n(\n3,681\n)\n$\n49,638\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\n \n \n$\n(\n666\n)\n$\n6,035\n \n$\n(\n666\n)\n$\n6,035\n \nResidential mortgage-backed\nAgency\n$\n(\n4\n)\n$\n1,015\n \n(\n2,805\n)\n24,306\n \n(\n2,809\n)\n25,321\n \nNon-agency\n(\n1\n)\n15\n \n(\n4\n)\n84\n \n(\n5\n)\n99\n \nCommercial mortgage-backed\nAgency\n \n \n(\n135\n)\n1,495\n \n(\n135\n)\n1,495\n \nNon-agency\n(\n45\n)\n731\n \n(\n45\n)\n731\n \nAsset-backed\n \n \n(\n1\n)\n9\n \n(\n1\n)\n9\n \nOther\n(\n3\n)\n78\n \n(\n136\n)\n2,106\n \n(\n139\n)\n2,184\n \nTotal securities available-for-sale\n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n1,108\n \n$\n(\n3,792\n)\n$\n34,766\n \n$\n(\n3,800\n)\n$\n35,874\n \nInformation related to gross realized securities gains and losses from the sales of securities is set forth in the following table:\nTable 45: Gains (Losses) on Sales of Securities Available-for-Sale\nYear ended December 31\nIn millions\nGross Gains\nGross Losses\nNet Gains (Losses)\nTax Expense (Benefit)\n2024\n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n502\n)\n$\n(\n500\n)\n$\n(\n105\n)\n2023\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n(\n2\n)\n2022\n$\n11\n \n$\n(\n18\n)\n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n(\n1\n)\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we sold available-for-sale securities with a market value of $\n3.8\n billion, resulting in a loss of $\n497\n million. \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n117\n \nThe following table presents, by remaining contractual maturity, the amortized cost, fair value and weighted-average yield of debt securities at December 31, 2024:\nTable 46: Contractual Maturity of Debt Securities\n1 Year or\nLess\nAfter 1 Year\nthrough 5 Years\nAfter 5 Years\nthrough 10 Years\nAfter 10\nYears\nTotal\nDollars in millions\nSecurities Available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\n$\n512\n \n$\n10,325\n \n$\n10,849\n \n$\n2,276\n \n$\n23,962\n \nResidential mortgage-backed\nAgency\n4\n \n226\n \n3,627\n \n29,732\n \n33,589\n \nNon-agency\n \n18\n \n486\n \n504\n \nCommercial mortgage-backed\nAgency\n73\n \n1,101\n \n475\n \n428\n \n2,077\n \nNon-agency\n1\n \n103\n \n84\n \n518\n \n706\n \nAsset-backed\n \n850\n \n319\n \n1,184\n \n2,353\n \nOther\n283\n \n1,623\n \n261\n \n140\n \n2,307\n \nTotal securities available-for-sale at amortized cost\n$\n873\n \n$\n14,228\n \n$\n15,633\n \n$\n34,764\n \n$\n65,498\n \nFair value\n$\n870\n \n$\n14,074\n \n$\n15,287\n \n$\n31,808\n \n$\n62,039\n \nWeighted-average yield, GAAP basis (a)\n2.75\n \n%\n3.69\n \n%\n4.10\n \n%\n3.73\n \n%\n3.80\n \n%\nSecurities Held-to-Maturity\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\n$\n8,211\n \n$\n18,783\n \n$\n1,563\n \n$\n863\n \n$\n29,420\n \nResidential mortgage-backed\nAgency\n7\n \n290\n \n39,874\n \n40,171\n \nNon-agency\n240\n \n240\n \nCommercial mortgage-backed\nAgency\n \n278\n \n469\n \n208\n \n955\n \nNon-agency\n \n39\n \n797\n \n836\n \nAsset-backed\n \n967\n \n1,393\n \n1,020\n \n3,380\n \nOther\n304\n \n796\n \n322\n \n1,269\n \n2,691\n \nTotal securities held-to-maturity at amortized cost\n$\n8,515\n \n$\n20,870\n \n$\n4,037\n \n$\n44,271\n \n$\n77,693\n \nFair value\n$\n8,448\n \n$\n20,271\n \n$\n3,856\n \n$\n40,483\n \n$\n73,058\n \nWeighted-average yield, GAAP basis (a)\n1.36\n \n%\n1.72\n \n%\n3.05\n \n%\n2.93\n \n%\n2.44\n \n%\n(a)        Weighted-average yields are based on amortized cost with effective yields weighted for the contractual maturity of each security.

Possible product features that may create a concentration of credit risk would\ninclude a high original or updated LTV ratio, term lengths that may expose the borrower to payment terms above market interest rates and interest-only loans, among others.\nWe originate interest-only loans to commercial borrowers. Such credit arrangements are usually designed to match borrower cash flow expectations (\ne.g.\n, working capital lines, revolvers). These products are standard in the financial services industry and product features are considered during the underwriting process to mitigate the increased risk that borrowers may not be able to make interest and principal payments when due as a result of the interest-only feature. We do not believe that these product features create a concentration of credit risk.\n120\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nAt December 31, 2024, we pledged unpaid principal balances in the amounts of $\n43.4\n billion of commercial and other loans to the Federal Reserve Bank and $\n89.0\n billion of residential real estate and other loans to the FHLB as collateral for the ability to borrow, if necessary. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $\n51.3\n billion and $\n89.5\n billion, respectively. \nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Interest income is generally not recognized on these loans. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are reported as performing loans; however, when nonaccrual criteria is met, interest income is not recognized on these loans. Additionally, certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are not reported as nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information on our nonperforming loan and lease policies.\nThe following table presents our nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:      \nTable 49: Nonperforming Assets\nDollars in millions\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nNonperforming loans\nCommercial\n$\n1,462\n \n$\n1,307\n \nConsumer (a)\n864\n \n873\n \nTotal nonperforming loans (b)\n2,326\n \n2,180\n \nOREO and foreclosed assets\n31\n \n36\n \nTotal nonperforming assets \n$\n2,357\n \n$\n2,216\n \nNonperforming loans to total loans\n0.73\n \n%\n0.68\n \n%\nNonperforming assets to total loans, OREO and foreclosed assets\n0.74\n \n%\n0.69\n \n%\nNonperforming assets to total assets\n0.42\n \n%\n0.39\n \n%\n(a)\nExcludes most unsecured consumer loans and lines of credit, which are charged-off after \n120\n to \n180\n days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status.\n(b)\nNonperforming loans for which there is no related ALLL totaled $\n0.6\n billion and $\n0.5\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This primarily includes loans with a fair value of collateral that exceeds the amortized cost basis.\n \nAdditional Credit Quality Indicators by Loan Class\nCommercial and Industrial\nFor commercial and industrial loans, we monitor the performance of the borrower in a disciplined and regular manner based upon the level of credit risk inherent in the loan. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign an internal risk rating reflecting the borrower’s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process. These ratings are generally reviewed and updated at least once per year. For small balance homogeneous pools of commercial and industrial loans and leases, we apply scoring techniques to assist in determining the PD. The combination of the PD and LGD ratings assigned to commercial and industrial loans, capturing both the combination of expectations of default and loss severity in the event of default, reflects credit quality characteristics as of the reporting date and are used as inputs into our loss forecasting process.\nBased upon the amount of the lending arrangement and our risk rating assessment, we follow a formal schedule of written periodic reviews. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews of a market’s or business unit’s loan portfolio, focusing on those loans which we perceive to be of higher risk, based upon PD and LGD, or loans for which credit quality is weakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our practice to review any customer obligation and its level of credit risk more frequently. We attempt to proactively manage our loans by using various procedures that are customized to the risk of a given loan, including ongoing outreach, contact, and assessment of obligor financial conditions, collateral inspection and appraisal.\nCommercial Real Estate\nWe manage credit risk associated with our commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgages similar to commercial and industrial loans by evaluating PD and LGD. Risks associated with commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgage activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure and collateral location, project progress and business environment. As a result, these attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk.\nAs with the commercial and industrial loan class, a formal schedule of periodic reviews is also performed to assess market/geographic risk and business unit/industry risk. Often as a result of these reviews, more in-depth reviews and increased scrutiny are placed on areas of higher risk, such as adverse changes in risk ratings, deteriorating operating trends, and/or areas that concern management. These reviews are designed to assess risk and facilitate actions to mitigate such risks.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n121\n \nEquipment Lease Financing\nWe manage credit risk associated with our equipment lease financing loan class similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD.\nBased upon the dollar amount of the lease and the level of credit risk, we follow a formal schedule of periodic reviews. Generally, this occurs quarterly, although we have established practices to review such credit risk more frequently if circumstances warrant. Our review process entails analysis of the following factors: equipment value/residual value, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk, industry risk, guarantor requirements and regulatory compliance as applicable.\nThe following table presents credit quality indicators for our commercial loan classes:\nTable 50: Commercial Credit Quality Indicators (a)\nTerm Loans by Origination Year\nDecember 31, 2024\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nPrior\nRevolving Loans\nRevolving Loans Converted  to Term\nTotal\nCommercial and industrial\nPass Rated\n$\n22,145\n \n$\n13,815\n \n$\n17,043\n \n$\n5,275\n \n$\n4,594\n \n$\n11,270\n \n$\n91,389\n \n$\n522\n \n$\n166,053\n \nCriticized\n761\n \n878\n \n1,856\n \n601\n \n144\n \n580\n \n4,868\n \n49\n \n9,737\n \nTotal commercial and industrial loans\n22,906\n14,693\n18,899\n5,876\n4,738\n11,850\n96,257\n571\n175,790\nGross charge-offs (b)\n22\n(c)\n32\n51\n25\n5\n7\n133\n53\n328\nCommercial real estate\nPass Rated\n2,331\n \n5,575\n \n6,875\n \n2,232\n \n1,220\n \n9,685\n \n423\n \n \n28,341\n \nCriticized\n141\n \n335\n \n1,974\n \n485\n \n465\n \n1,853\n \n25\n \n \n5,278\n \nTotal commercial real estate loans\n2,472\n5,910\n8,849\n2,717\n1,685\n11,538\n448\n33,619\nGross charge-offs (b)\n28\n5\n2\n1\n322\n358\nEquipment lease financing\nPass Rated\n1,814\n \n1,264\n \n1,112\n \n478\n \n478\n \n1,305\n \n \n \n6,451\n \nCriticized\n51\n \n79\n \n88\n \n35\n \n21\n \n30\n \n \n \n304\n \nTotal equipment lease financing loans\n1,865\n1,343\n \n1,200\n513\n499\n1,335\n6,755\nGross charge-offs (b)\n1\n6\n12\n5\n4\n6\n34\nTotal commercial loans\n$\n27,243\n \n$\n21,946\n \n$\n28,948\n \n$\n9,106\n \n$\n6,922\n \n$\n24,723\n \n$\n96,705\n \n$\n571\n \n$\n216,164\n \nTotal commercial gross charge-offs\n$\n51\n \n$\n43\n \n$\n63\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n335\n \n$\n133\n \n$\n53\n \n$\n720\n \n \nTerm Loans by Origination Year \n \nDecember 31, 2023\nIn millions\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019\nPrior\nRevolving Loans\nRevolving Loans Converted  to Term\nTotal \nCommercial and industrial\nPass Rated\n$\n23,019\n \n$\n26,657\n \n$\n7,562\n \n$\n5,783\n \n$\n4,110\n \n$\n11,982\n \n$\n88,467\n \n$\n573\n \n$\n168,153\n \nCriticized\n838\n \n1,781\n \n739\n \n331\n \n281\n \n698\n \n4,708\n \n51\n \n9,427\n \nTotal commercial and industrial loans\n23,857\n \n28,438\n \n8,301\n \n6,114\n \n4,391\n \n12,680\n \n93,175\n \n624\n \n177,580\n \nGross charge-offs (b)\n25\n \n(c)\n32\n \n33\n \n8\n \n3\n \n26\n \n105\n \n12\n \n244\n \nCommercial real estate\nPass Rated\n4,182\n \n8,571\n \n2,986\n \n2,190\n \n4,887\n \n7,411\n \n383\n \n \n30,610\n \nCriticized\n155\n \n1,300\n \n455\n \n490\n \n622\n \n1,753\n \n51\n \n \n4,826\n \nTotal commercial real estate loans\n4,337\n \n9,871\n \n3,441\n \n2,680\n \n5,509\n \n9,164\n \n434\n \n35,436\n \nGross charge-offs (b)\n \n \n \n12\n \n31\n \n137\n \n \n \n180\n \nEquipment lease financing\nPass Rated\n1,522\n \n1,424\n \n689\n \n690\n \n452\n \n1,378\n \n \n \n6,155\n \nCriticized\n90\n \n81\n \n81\n \n51\n \n35\n \n49\n \n \n \n387\n \nTotal equipment lease financing loans\n1,612\n \n1,505\n \n770\n \n741\n \n487\n \n1,427\n \n6,542\n \nGross charge-offs (b)\n4\n \n4\n \n4\n \n4\n \n1\n \n1\n \n \n \n18\n \nTotal commercial loans\n$\n29,806\n \n$\n39,814\n \n$\n12,512\n \n$\n9,535\n \n$\n10,387\n \n$\n23,271\n \n$\n93,609\n \n$\n624\n \n$\n219,558\n \nTotal commercial gross charge-offs\n$\n29\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n35\n \n$\n164\n \n$\n105\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n442\n \n(a)\nLoans in our commercial portfolio are classified as Pass Rated or Criticized based on the regulatory definitions, which are driven by the PD and LGD ratings that we assign.

A summary of credit quality indicators follows:\nDelinquency/Delinquency Rates\n:\n We monitor delinquency/delinquency rate trends for residential real estate and home equity loans. See Table 48 for additional information.\nNonperforming Loans\n:\n We monitor nonperforming loan trends for residential real estate and home equity loans. See Table 48 for additional information.\nCredit Scores:\n We use a national third-party provider to update FICO credit scores for residential real estate and home equity loans at least quarterly. The updated scores are incorporated into a series of credit management reports, which are utilized to monitor the risk in the loan classes.\nLTV (inclusive of CLTV for first and subordinate lien positions):\n At least quarterly, we update the property values of real estate collateral and calculate an updated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines secured by real estate in regions experiencing significant declines in property values, more frequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV migration and stratify LTV into categories to monitor the risk in the loan classes.\nWe use a combination of original LTV and updated LTV for internal risk management and reporting purposes (\ne.g.\n, line management, loss mitigation strategies). In addition to the fact that estimated property values by their nature are estimates, given certain data limitations, it is important to note that updated LTVs may be based upon management’s assumptions (\ni.e.\n, if an updated LTV is not provided by the third-party service provider, HPI changes will be incorporated in arriving at management’s estimate of updated LTV).\nUpdated LTV is estimated using modeled property values. The related estimates and inputs are based upon an approach that uses a combination of third-party automated valuation models, broker price opinions, HPI indices, property location, internal and external balance information, origination data and management assumptions. \nWe generally utilize origination lien balances provided by a third-party, where applicable, which do not include an amortization assumption when calculating updated LTV. Accordingly, the results of the calculations do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral or updated LTV based upon lien balances held by others, and as such, are necessarily imprecise and subject to change as we refine our methodology.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n123\n \nThe following table presents credit quality indicators for our residential real

Education and Other Consumer\nWe monitor a variety of credit quality information in the management of these consumer loan classes. For all loan types, we generally use a combination of internal loan parameters as well as an updated FICO score. We use FICO scores as a primary credit quality indicator for automobile and credit card loans, as well as non-government guaranteed or non-insured education loans and other secured and unsecured lines and loans. Internal credit metrics, such as delinquency status, are heavily relied upon as credit quality indicators for government guaranteed or insured education loans and consumer loans to high net worth individuals, as internal credit metrics are more relevant than FICO scores for these types of loans. \nAlong with the monitoring of delinquency trends and losses for each class, FICO credit score updates are obtained at least quarterly along with a variety of credit bureau attributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend to have a lower likelihood of loss. Conversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to have a higher likelihood of loss.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n125\n \nThe following table presents credit quality

The terms of these programs, which are offered for certain consumer products, are as follows:\n•\nCredit card and unsecured lines of credit\n•\nShort-term programs are granted for periods of \n6\n and \n12\n months. These programs are structurally similar such that the interest rate is reduced to a standard rate of \n4.99\n% and the minimum payment percentage is adjusted to \n1.90\n% of the outstanding balance. At the end of the \n6\n or \n12\n months, the borrower is returned to the original contractual interest rate and minimum payment amount specified in the original lending agreement.\n•\nFully-amortized repayment plans are also granted, the most common of which being a \n60\n month program. In this program, we convert the borrower’s drawn and unpaid balances into a fully-amortized repayment plan consisting of an interest rate of \n4.99\n% and an adjusted minimum payment percentage of \n1.90\n% of the outstanding balance. This fully-amortized program is designed in a manner that allows the drawn and unpaid amounts to be recaptured at the end of the \n60\n months.\n•\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\n•\nFixed payment plan programs establish a modified monthly payment that is informed by the borrower’s financial situation and the current market environment at the time of modification, among other factors. As such, we may change the borrower’s interest rate, modify the term of the loan, and/or defer payment to arrive at the modified monthly \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n129\n \npayment.

These transfers have occurred through Agency securitization, Non-agency securitization, and loan sale transactions. Agency securitizations consist of securitization transactions with FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA (collectively, the Agencies). FNMA and FHLMC generally securitize our transferred loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market through SPEs that they sponsor. As an authorized GNMA issuer/servicer, we pool FHA and Department of VA insured loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market. In Non-agency securitizations, we have transferred loans into securitization SPEs. In other instances, third-party investors have also purchased our loans in loan sale transactions and in certain instances have subsequently sold these loans into securitization SPEs. Securitization SPEs utilized in the Agency and Non-agency securitization transactions are VIEs.\nOur continuing involvement in the FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA securitizations, Non-agency securitizations, and loan sale transactions generally consists of servicing, repurchasing previously transferred loans or loss share arrangements under certain conditions, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs.\nDepending on the transaction, we may act as the master, primary and/or special servicer to the securitization SPEs or third-party investors. Servicing responsibilities typically consist of collecting and remitting monthly borrower principal and interest payments, maintaining escrow deposits, performing loss mitigation and foreclosure activities, and, in certain instances, funding of servicing advances. Servicing advances, which are generally reimbursable, are made for principal and interest and collateral protection and are carried in Other assets at cost.\n132\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nWe earn servicing and other ancillary fees for our role as servicer and, depending on the contractual terms of the servicing arrangement, we can be terminated as servicer with or without cause. At the consummation date of each type of loan transfer where we retain the servicing, we recognize a servicing right at fair value. See Note 5 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights and Note 14 Fair Value for further discussion of our servicing rights.\nCertain loans transferred to the Agencies contain ROAPs. Under these ROAPs, we hold an option to repurchase at par individual delinquent loans that meet certain criteria. In other limited cases, GNMA has granted us the right to repurchase current loans when we intend to modify the borrower’s interest rate under established guidelines. When we have the unilateral ability to repurchase a loan, effective control over the loan has been regained and we recognize an asset (in either Loans or Loans held for sale) and a corresponding liability (in Other borrowed funds) on the balance sheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan.\nThe Agency and Non-agency mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs that are purchased and held on our balance sheet are typically purchased in the secondary market. We do not retain any credit risk on our Agency mortgage-backed security positions as FNMA, FHLMC and the U.S. Government (for GNMA) guarantee losses of principal and interest.\nWe also have involvement with certain Agency and Non-agency commercial securitization SPEs where we have not transferred commercial mortgage loans. These SPEs were sponsored by independent third-parties and the loans held by these entities were purchased exclusively from other third-parties. Generally, our involvement with these SPEs is as servicer with servicing activities consistent with those described above.\nWe recognize a liability for our loss exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to possible breaches of representations and warranties and also for loss sharing arrangements (recourse obligations) with the Agencies. Other than providing temporary liquidity under servicing advances and our loss exposure associated with our repurchase and recourse obligations, we have not provided nor are we required to provide any type of credit support, guarantees or commitments to the securitization SPEs or third-party investors in these transactions.\nThe following table provides our loan sale and servicing activities: \nTable 59: Loan Sale and Servicing Activities \nIn millions\nResidential Mortgages\nCommercial Mortgages (a)\nCash Flows - Year ended December 31, 2024\nSales of loans and related securitization activity (b)\n$\n3,060\n \n$\n3,918\n \nRepurchases of previously transferred loans (c)\n$\n103\n \n$\n9\n \nServicing fees (d) \n$\n551\n \n$\n204\n \nServicing advances recovered/(funded), net\n$\n19\n \n$\n(\n92\n)\nCash flows on mortgage-backed securities held (e)\n$\n2,499\n \n$\n67\n \nCash Flows - Year ended December 31, 2023\nSales of loans and related securitization activity (b)\n$\n2,648\n \n$\n3,650\n \nRepurchases of previously transferred loans (c)\n$\n87\n \nServicing fees (d)\n$\n529\n \n$\n198\n \nServicing advances recovered/(funded), net\n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n(\n140\n)\nCash flows on mortgage-backed securities held (e)\n$\n2,624\n \n$\n75\n \n(a)\nRepresents both commercial mortgage loan transfer and servicing activities.\n(b)\nGains/losses recognized on sales of loans were insignificant for the periods presented.\n(c)\nIncludes both residential and commercial mortgage government insured or guaranteed loans eligible for repurchase through the exercise of our ROAP option, as well as residential mortgage loans repurchased due to alleged breaches of origination covenants or representations and warranties made to purchasers.\n(d)\nIncludes contractually specified servicing fees, late charges and ancillary fees.\n(e)\nRepresents cash flows on securities where we transferred to, and/or service loans for, a securitization SPE and we hold securities issued by that SPE.

Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $\n20.4\n billion and $\n0.7\n billion, respectively.\n \nTable 60 presents information about the principal balances of transferred loans that we service and are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We would only experience a loss on these transferred loans if we were required to repurchase a loan, where the repurchase price exceeded the loan’s fair value, due to a breach in representations and warranties or a loss sharing arrangement associated with our continuing involvement with these loans.

Net charge-offs for Commercial mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported by the trustee for commercial mortgage-backed securitizations. Realized losses for Agency securitizations are not reflected as we do not manage the underlying real estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to loss information.\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nWe are involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are deemed to be VIEs. We assess VIEs for consolidation based upon the accounting policies described in Note 1 Accounting Policies. Our consolidated VIEs were insignificant at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. We have not provided additional financial support to these entities which we are not contractually required to provide.\nThe following table provides a summary of non-consolidated VIEs with which we have significant continuing involvement but are not the primary beneficiary. We have excluded certain transactions with non-consolidated VIEs from the balances presented in Table 61 where we have determined that our continuing involvement is insignificant. We do not consider our continuing involvement to be significant when it relates to a VIE where we only invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or where no transfers have occurred between us and the VIE. In addition, where we only have lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have excluded these transactions with non-consolidated entities from the balances presented in Table 61. These loans are included as part of the asset quality disclosures that we make in Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.\nTable 61: Non-Consolidated VIEs \nIn millions\nPNC Risk of Loss (a)\nCarrying Value of Assets\nCarrying Value of Liabilities\nDecember 31, 2024\n \nMortgage-backed securitizations (b) \n$\n19,187\n \n$\n19,191\n \n(c) \n \n \nTax credit investments and other\n5,513\n \n5,491\n \n(d) (e)\n$\n2,627\n \n(f) (g)\nTotal\n$\n24,700\n \n$\n24,682\n \n  \n$\n2,627\n \n  \nDecember 31, 2023\n \nMortgage-backed securitizations (b)\n$\n21,451\n \n$\n21,453\n \n(c) \n \n \nTax credit investments and other\n4,709\n \n4,631\n \n(d) (e)\n$\n2,119\n \n(f) (g)\nTotal\n$\n26,160\n \n$\n26,084\n \n  \n$\n2,119\n \n  \n(a)\nRepresents loans, investments and other assets related to non-consolidated VIEs, net of collateral (if applicable).

Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $\n1.6\n billion and $\n0.2\n billion, respectively.\n \nMortgage-Backed Securitizations\nIn connection with each Agency and Non-agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securitization discussed above, we evaluate each SPE utilized in these transactions for consolidation. In performing these assessments, we evaluate our level of continuing involvement in these transactions as the nature of our involvement ultimately determines whether or not we hold a variable \n134\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \ninterest and/or are the primary beneficiary of the SPE. Factors we consider in our consolidation assessment include the significance of (i) our role as servicer, (ii) our holdings of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPE and (iii) the rights of third-party variable interest holders.\nThe first step in our assessment is to determine whether we hold a variable interest in the securitization SPE. We hold variable interests in Agency and Non-agency securitization SPEs through our holding of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by the SPEs and/or our recourse obligations. Each SPE in which we hold a variable interest is evaluated to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For Agency securitization transactions, our contractual role as servicer does not give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the SPEs. Thus, we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities. For Non-agency securitization transactions, we would be the primary beneficiary to the extent our servicing activities give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the SPE and we hold a more-than-insignificant variable interest in the entity.\nDetails about the Agency and Non-agency securitization SPEs where we hold a variable interest and are not the primary beneficiary are included in Table 61. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these SPEs is the carrying value of the mortgage-backed securities, servicing assets, servicing advances and our liabilities associated with our recourse obligations. Creditors of the securitization SPEs have no recourse to our assets or general credit.\nTax Credit Investments and Other\nFor tax credit investments in which we do not have the right to make decisions that will most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity, we are not the primary beneficiary and thus do not consolidate the entity. These investments are disclosed in Table 61. The table also reflects our maximum exposure to loss exclusive of any potential tax credit recapture. Our maximum exposure to loss is equal to our legally binding equity commitments adjusted for recorded impairment, partnership results or amortization for qualifying LIHTC investments when applicable. For all legally binding unfunded equity commitments, we increase our recognized investment and recognize a liability. As of December 31, 2024, we had a liability for unfunded commitments of $\n2.2\n billion related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects which is reflected in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nTable 61 also includes our involvement in lease financing transactions with LLCs engaged in solar power generation that, to a large extent, provided returns in the form of tax credits. The outstanding financings and operating lease assets are reflected as Loans and Other assets, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas related liabilities are reported in Deposits and Other liabilities.\nWe also make certain equity investments in various tax credit limited partnerships or LLCs. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the CRA. During 2024, we recognized $\n0.5\n billion of amortization, $\n0.5\n billion of tax credits and $\n0.1\n billion of other tax benefits associated with qualified investments in LIHTCs and NMTCs within Income taxes. We recognized $\n0.4\n billion of amortization, $\n0.4\n billion of tax credits and less than $\n0.1\n billion of other tax benefits associated with qualified investments in LIHTCs within Income taxes in 2023. Comparable amounts for 2022 were $\n0.4\n billion, $\n0.4\n billion and less than $\n0.1\n billion, respectively.\nN\nOTE\n 5 \nG\nOODWILL AND\n M\nORTGAGE\n S\nERVICING\n R\nIGHTS\nAssets and liabilities of acquired entities are recorded at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.\nGoodwill\nAllocations of goodwill by business segment at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 follow:\nTable 62: Goodwill by Business Segment\nIn millions\nRetail Banking\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\nAsset Management Group\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n6,473\n \n$\n4,270\n \n$\n189\n \n$\n10,932\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n6,473\n \n$\n4,270\n \n$\n189\n \n$\n10,932\n \nOther \n(\n55\n)\n(\n55\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n6,473\n \n$\n4,325\n \n$\n189\n \n$\n10,987\n \nWe review goodwill in each of our reporting units for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date.

MSRs are recognized either when purchased or when originated loans are sold with servicing retained. MSRs totaled $\n3.7\n billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, and consisted of loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential mortgages measured at fair value. \nCommercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\nWe recognize gains (losses) on changes in the fair value of commercial MSRs. Commercial MSRs are subject to changes in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of commercial MSRs with securities, derivative instruments and resale agreements which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of commercial MSRs decreases (or increases).\nThe fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating inputs for assumptions as to constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors determined based on current market conditions and expectations.\nChanges in the commercial MSRs follow:\nTable 63: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nJanuary 1\n$\n1,032\n \n$\n1,113\n \n$\n740\n \nAdditions:\nFrom loans sold with servicing retained\n44\n \n50\n \n62\n \nPurchases\n64\n \n44\n \n46\n \nChanges in fair value due to:\nTime and payoffs (a)\n(\n317\n)\n(\n332\n)\n(\n208\n)\nOther (b)\n262\n \n157\n \n473\n \nDecember 31\n$\n1,085\n \n$\n1,032\n \n$\n1,113\n \nRelated unpaid principal balance at December 31\n$\n290,384\n \n$\n288,042\n \n$\n281,277\n \nServicing advances at December 31\n$\n653\n \n$\n561\n \n$\n421\n \n(a)\nRepresents decrease in MSR value due to passage of time, which includes the impact from regularly scheduled loan principal payments, prepayments and loans that were paid off during the period.\n(b)\nIncludes MSR value changes resulting from changes in interest rates and other market-driven conditions.\nResidential Mortgage Servicing Rights\nWe recognize gains (losses) on changes in the fair value of residential MSRs. Residential MSRs are subject to changes in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of residential MSRs with securities and derivative instruments that are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of residential MSRs decreases (or increases).\nThe fair value of residential MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs and other factors that are determined based on current market conditions.\n136\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nChanges in the residential MSRs follow:\nTable 64: Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nJanuary 1\n$\n2,654\n \n$\n2,310\n \n$\n1,078\n \nAdditions:\nFrom loans sold with servicing retained\n28\n \n23\n \n57\n \nPurchases\n43\n \n444\n \n897\n \nChanges in fair value due to:\nTime and payoffs (a)\n(\n254\n)\n(\n237\n)\n(\n231\n)\nOther (b)\n155\n \n115\n \n509\n \nSale\n \n(\n1\n)\nDecember 31\n$\n2,626\n \n$\n2,654\n \n$\n2,310\n \nUnpaid principal balance of loans serviced for others at December 31\n$\n196,915\n \n$\n209,158\n \n$\n189,831\n \nServicing advances at December 31\n$\n153\n \n$\n172\n \n$\n165\n \n(a)\nRepresents decrease in MSR value due to passage of time, which includes the impact from regularly scheduled loan principal payments, prepayments and loans that were paid off during the period.\n(b)\nIncludes MSR value changes resulting from changes in interest rates and other market-driven conditions.\nSensitivity Analysis\nThe fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation models as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are shown in Tables 65 and 66. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses both internal proprietary models and a third-party model to estimate future commercial mortgage loan prepayments and a third-party model to estimate future residential mortgage loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions and management judgment. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate.\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is also presented in Tables 65 and 66. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (\ne.g.\n, changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities.\nThe following tables set forth the fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and the sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate adverse changes of 10% and 20% in those assumptions:\nTable 65: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights – Key Valuation Assumptions\nDollars in millions\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair value\n$\n1,085\n$\n1,032\nWeighted-average life (years)\n3.8\n3.9\nWeighted-average constant prepayment rate\n4.45\n \n%\n5.51\n%\nDecline in fair value from 10% adverse change\n$\n8\n$\n9\nDecline in fair value from 20% adverse change\n$\n16\n$\n17\nEffective discount rate\n11.18\n \n%\n9.64\n%\nDecline in fair value from 10% adverse change\n$\n35\n$\n31\nDecline in fair value from 20% adverse change\n$\n69\n$\n61\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n137\n \nTable 66: Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights – Key Valuation Assumptions\nDollars in millions\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nFair value\n$\n2,626\n \n \n$\n2,654\n \n \nWeighted-average life (years)\n8.0\n \n8.1\n \nWeighted-average constant prepayment rate\n6.39\n \n%\n6.42\n \n%\nDecline in fair value from 10% adverse change\n$\n57\n \n \n$\n60\n \n \nDecline in fair value from 20% adverse change\n$\n111\n \n \n$\n117\n \n \nWeighted-average option adjusted spread\n755\n \nbps\n765\n \nbps\nDecline in fair value from 10% adverse change\n$\n81\n \n \n$\n83\n \n \nDecline in fair value from 20% adverse change\n$\n157\n \n \n$\n161\n \n \nFees from mortgage loan servicing, which include contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and ancillary fees, were $\n0.7\n billion for both 2024 and 2023, compared to $\n0.6\n billion for 2022.

These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, may require payment of a fee and generally contain termination clauses in the event the customer’s credit quality deteriorates.\nNet Outstanding Standby Letters of Credit\nWe issue standby letters of credit and share in the risk of standby letters of credit issued by other financial institutions, in each case to support obligations of our customers to third parties, such as insurance requirements and the facilitation of transactions involving capital markets product execution. Approximately \n97\n% of our net outstanding standby letters of credit were rated as Pass at December 31, 2024, with the remainder rated as Criticized. An internal credit rating of Pass indicates the expected risk of loss is currently low, while a rating of Criticized indicates a higher degree of risk.\nIf the customer fails to meet its financial or performance obligation to the third party under the terms of the contract or there is a need to support a remarketing program, then upon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the terms of the letter of credit, we would be obligated to make payment to them.

10-K\nN\nOTE\n 14 \nF\nAIR\n V\nALUE\nFair Value Measurement\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date and is determined using an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair value hierarchy established by GAAP requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n•\nLevel 1:\n Fair value is determined using a quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities may include debt securities, equity securities and listed derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, and certain U.S. Treasury securities that are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.\n•\nLevel 2:\n Fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. The majority of Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities and listed derivative contracts with quoted prices that are traded in markets that are not active, and certain debt and equity securities and over-the-counter derivative contracts whose fair value is determined using a pricing model without significant unobservable inputs.\n•\nLevel 3:\n Fair value is estimated using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques for which the significant valuation inputs are not observable and the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nWe characterize active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information, with reasonably narrow bid/ask spreads, and where dealer quotes received do not vary widely and are based on current information. Inactive markets are typically characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations that vary substantially among market participants or are not based on current information, wide bid/ask spreads, a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators for observed transactions or quoted prices compared to historical periods, a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuance, or any combination of the above factors. We also consider nonperformance risks, including credit risk, as part of our valuation methodology for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value, by their nature, result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 inherently require the use of various assumptions, estimates and judgments when measuring their fair value. As observable market activity is commonly not available to use when estimating the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities, we must estimate fair value using various modeling techniques. These techniques include the use of a variety of inputs/assumptions including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates or other relevant inputs across the entire population of our Level 3 assets and liabilities. Changes in the significant underlying factors or assumptions (either an increase or a decrease) in any of these areas underlying our estimates may have resulted in a significant increase/decrease in the Level 3 fair value measurement of a particular asset and/or liability from period to period.\nAny models used to determine fair values or to validate dealer quotes are subject to review and independent testing as part of our model validation and internal control testing processes. Our Model Risk Management Group reviews significant models on at least an annual basis. In addition, the Valuation Committee approves valuation methodologies and reviews the results of independent valuation reviews and processes for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n \nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\nWe account for certain residential mortgage loans originated for sale at fair value on a recurring basis. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for the residential mortgages with the related hedges. Residential mortgage loans are valued based on quoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants. The prices are adjusted as necessary to include the embedded servicing value in the loans and to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans. These adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in these inputs to the fair value of the loans. Accordingly, the majority of residential mortgage loans held for sale are classified as Level 2.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\nWe account for certain commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale in whole loan transactions at fair value. We determine the fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for sale based upon discounted cash flows. Fair value is determined using sale valuation assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the loans.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n147\nFor loans to be sold to agencies with servicing retained, the fair value is adjusted for the estimated servicing cash flows, which is an unobservable input. This adjustment is not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in the input to the fair value of the loans. Accordingly, commercial mortgage loans held for sale to agencies are classified as Level 2.\nValuation assumptions may include observable inputs based on the benchmark interest rate swap curve, whole loan sales and agency sales transactions. The significant unobservable input for commercial mortgage loans held for sale, excluding those to be sold to agencies, is management’s assumption of the spread applied to the benchmark rate. The spread over the benchmark curve includes management’s assumptions of the impact of credit and liquidity risk. Significant increases (decreases) in the spread applied to the benchmark would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) asset value. The wide range of the spread over the benchmark curve is due to the varying risk and underlying property characteristics within our portfolio. Based on the significance of the unobservable input, we classified this portfolio as Level 3.\nSecurities Available-for-Sale and Trading Securities\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include both the available-for-sale and trading portfolios. We primarily use prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. The majority of securities were priced by third-party vendors. The third-party vendors use a variety of methods when pricing securities that incorporate relevant market data to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security under current market conditions. We monitor and validate the reliability of vendor pricing on an ongoing basis through pricing methodology reviews, including detailed reviews of the assumptions and inputs used by the vendor to price individual securities, and through price validation testing. Securities not priced by one of our pricing vendors may be valued using a dealer quote, which are also subject to price validation testing. Price validation testing is performed independent of the risk-taking function and involves corroborating the prices received from third-party vendors and dealers with prices from another third party or through other sources, such as internal valuations or sales of similar securities. Security prices are also validated through actual cash settlement upon sale of a security.\nSecurities are classified within the fair value hierarchy after considering the activity level in the market for the security type and the observability of the inputs used to determine the fair value. When a quoted price in an active market exists for the identical security, this price is used to determine fair value and the security is classified within Level 1 of the hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities. \nWhen a quoted price in an active market for the identical security is not available, fair value is estimated using either an alternative market approach, such as a recent trade or matrix pricing, or an income approach, such as a discounted cash flow pricing model. If the inputs to the valuation are based primarily on market observable information, then the security is classified within Level 2 of the hierarchy. Level 2 securities include agency debt securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities collateralized by non-mortgage-related corporate and consumer loans, and other debt securities. Level 2 securities are predominantly priced by third parties, either by a pricing vendor or dealer.\nIn certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around the inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. Securities classified as Level 3 consist primarily of non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities collateralized by first- and second-lien residential mortgage loans. Fair value for these securities is primarily estimated using pricing obtained from third-party vendors. In some cases, fair value is estimated using a dealer quote, by reference to prices of securities of a similar vintage and collateral type or by reference to recent sales of similar securities. Market activity for these security types is limited with little price transparency. As a result, these securities are generally valued by the third-party vendor using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates significant unobservable inputs and observable market activity where available. Significant inputs to the valuation include prepayment projections and credit loss assumptions (default rate and loss severity) and discount rates that are deemed representative of current market conditions. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those assumptions in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.\nCertain infrequently traded debt securities within other debt securities available-for-sale and trading securities are also classified in Level 3 and are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 88. The significant unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair value of these securities include an estimate of expected credit losses and a discount for liquidity risk. These inputs are incorporated into the fair value measurement by either increasing the spread over the benchmark curve or by applying a credit and liquidity discount to the par value of the security. Significant increases (decreases) in credit and/or liquidity risk could have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value estimate.\nLoans\nLoans accounted for at fair value consist primarily of residential mortgage loans. These loans are generally valued similarly to residential mortgage loans held for sale and are classified as Level 2. However, similar to residential mortgage loans held for sale, if these loans are repurchased and unsalable, they are classified as Level 3. In addition, repurchased VA loans, where only a portion of the principal will be reimbursed, are classified as Level 3. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation based on our historical loss rate. We have elected to account for certain home equity lines of credit at fair value. These loans are classified as \n148\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\nLevel 3. Significant inputs to the valuation of these loans include credit and liquidity discount, cumulative default rate, loss severity and gross discount rate and are deemed representative of current market conditions. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these assumptions would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.\nEquity Investments\nEquity investments includes money market mutual funds as well as direct and indirect private equity investments. Money market mutual funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities and classified within Level 1 of the hierarchy. The valuation of direct and indirect private equity investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such investments. Various valuation techniques are used for direct investments, including multiples of adjusted earnings of the entity, independent appraisals, anticipated financing and sale transactions with third parties, or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. A multiple of adjusted earnings calculation is the valuation technique utilized most frequently and is the most significant unobservable input used in such calculation. Significant decreases (increases) in the multiple of earnings could have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Generally, direct equity investments are classified as Level 3.\nIndirect investments are not redeemable; however, we receive distributions over the life of the partnerships from liquidation of the underlying investments by the investee, which we expect to occur over the next \n12\n years. We value indirect investments in private equity funds using the NAV practical expedient as provided in the financial statements that we receive from fund managers. Due to the time lag in our receipt of the financial information and based on a review of investments and valuation techniques applied, adjustments to the manager-provided value are made when available recent portfolio company information or market information indicates a significant change in value from that provided by the manager of the fund. Indirect investments valued using NAV are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)\nMSRs are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Assumptions incorporated into the MSRs valuation model reflect management’s best estimate of factors that a market participant would use in valuing the MSRs. Although sales of MSRs do occur and can offer some market insight, MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available.\nResidential MSRs\nThe fair value of residential MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating unobservable inputs for assumptions such as constant prepayment rates, spread over the benchmark curve, and other factors. Due to the nature of the unobservable valuation inputs, residential MSRs are classified as Level 3. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of residential MSRs are constant prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve. Significant increases (decreases) in prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve would have resulted in lower (higher) fair market value of residential MSRs.\nAs a benchmark for the reasonableness of our residential MSRs fair value, we obtained opinions of value from independent brokers. These brokers provided a range (+/-\n10\n bps) based upon their own discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that reflect conditions in the secondary market and any recently executed servicing transactions. We compare our internally-developed residential MSRs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers. If our residential MSRs fair value falls outside of the brokers’ ranges, management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted. For the periods presented, our residential MSRs value did not fall outside of the brokers’ ranges. \nCommercial MSRs\nThe fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating unobservable inputs for assumptions such as constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors. Due to the nature of the unobservable valuation inputs and the limited availability of market pricing, commercial MSRs are classified as Level 3. Significant increases (decreases) in constant prepayment rates and discount rates would have resulted in significantly lower (higher) commercial MSR value determined based on current market conditions and expectations.\nFinancial Derivatives\nExchange-traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1. The majority of derivatives that we enter into are executed over-the-counter and are valued using internal models. These derivatives are primarily classified as Level 2, as the readily observable market inputs to these models are validated to external sources, such as industry pricing services, or are corroborated through recent trades, dealer quotes, yield curves, implied volatility or other market-related data. Level 2 financial derivatives are primarily estimated using observable benchmark interest rate swaps to construct projected discounted cash flows.\nFinancial derivatives that are priced using significant management judgment or assumptions are classified as Level 3. Unobservable inputs related to interest rate contracts include probability of funding of residential mortgage loan commitments and estimated servicing cash flows of commercial and residential mortgage loan commitments. Probability of default and loss severity are the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of risk participation agreements. The fair values of Level 3 assets and liabilities \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n149\nrelated to these interest rate contract financial derivatives as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 88 of this Note 14.\nIn connection with the sales of portions of our Visa Class B common shares, we entered into swap agreements with the purchasers of those shares to retain any future risk of decreases in the conversion rate of Class B common shares to Class A common shares resulting from increases in the escrow funded by Visa to pay for the costs of resolution of the pending interchange litigation (see Note 20 Legal Proceedings). These swaps also require PNC to make periodic payments based on the market price of the Class A common shares at a fixed rate of interest (in certain cases subject to step-up provisions) until the Visa litigation is resolved. An increase in the estimated length of litigation resolution date, a decrease in the estimated conversion rate or an increase in the estimated growth rate of the Class A share price would have had a negative impact on the fair value of the swaps and vice versa. In the second quarter of 2024, PNC participated in the Visa exchange program, allowing PNC to monetize approximately \n50\n% of its Visa Class B-1 shares. Accordingly, our underlying swap exposure decreased in 2024 as a result of this transaction.\nThe fair values of our derivatives include a credit and funding valuation adjustment to reflect our own and our counterparties’ nonperformance risk. Our credit valuation adjustment is computed using credit default swap spreads, in conjunction with internal historical recovery observations.\nOther Assets and Liabilities\nOther assets held at fair value on a recurring basis primarily include assets related to PNC’s deferred compensation and supplemental incentive savings plans.\nThe assets related to PNC’s deferred compensation and supplemental incentive savings plans primarily consist of a prepaid forward contract referencing an amount of shares of PNC stock, equity mutual funds and fixed income funds, and are valued based on the underlying investments. These assets are valued either by reference to the market price of PNC’s stock or by using the quoted market prices for investments other than PNC’s stock and are included in Levels 1 and 2.\nAll Level 3 other assets and liabilities are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 88 in this Note 14.\nOther Borrowed Funds\nOther borrowed funds primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities sold short which are classified as Level 1. Other borrowed funds also includes the related liability for certain repurchased loans for which we have elected the fair value option and are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, consistent with the level classification of the corresponding loans.

These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of amortized cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets due to impairment and are included in Table 89.\nNonaccrual Loans\nThe carrying value of nonaccrual loans represents the fair value of those loans which have been adjusted due to impairment. The impairment is primarily based on the appraised value of the collateral.\nRefer to Note 1 Accounting Policies for information on how we obtain appraisal values.\nEquity Investments \nThe majority of the amounts for equity investments represent the carrying value of LIHTC investments held for sale calculated using a discounted cash flow model. The significant unobservable input is management’s estimate of required market rate of return. The market rate of return is based on comparison to recent LIHTC sales in the market. Significant increases (decreases) in this input would result in a significantly lower (higher) carrying value of the investments.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n155\nOREO and Foreclosed Assets\nThe carrying value of OREO and foreclosed assets includes valuation adjustments recorded subsequent to the transfer to OREO and foreclosed assets. These valuation adjustments are based on the fair value less cost to sell of the property. Fair value is based on appraised value or sales price. Refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies for information on how we obtain appraisal values.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets consists of buildings for which valuation adjustments were recorded during the period. A facility classified as held for use is impaired to the extent its carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. Valuation adjustments on buildings held for sale are based on the fair value of the property less an estimated cost to sell and are recorded subsequent to the transfer of the asset to held for sale status. Fair value is determined either by a third-party appraisal, recent sales offer, changes in market or property conditions or, where we have agreed to sell the building to a third party, the contractual sales price. Impairment on these long-lived assets is recorded in Other noninterest expense on our Consolidated Income Statement.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are as follows:\nTable 89: Fair Value Measurements – Nonrecurring (a) (b) (c)\nYear ended December 31\nIn millions\nFair Value\nGains (Losses)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAssets\nNonaccrual loans\n$\n629\n \n$\n578\n \n$\n(\n279\n)\n$\n(\n410\n)\n$\n(\n287\n)\nEquity investments\n198\n \n203\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nOREO and foreclosed assets\n8\n \n12\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nLong-lived assets\n18\n \n9\n \n(\n12\n)\n(\n29\n)\n(\n15\n)\nTotal assets\n$\n853\n \n$\n802\n \n$\n(\n293\n)\n$\n(\n440\n)\n$\n(\n303\n)\n(a)\nAll Level 3 for the periods presented, except for $\n30\n million included in Equity investments which was categorized as Level 1 as of December 31, 2023.\n(b)\nValuation techniques applied were fair value of property or collateral.\n(c)\nUnobservable inputs used were appraised value/sales price, broker opinions or projected income/required improvement costs.

For more information on these financial instruments for which the fair value option election has been made, refer to the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note 14. These financial instruments are initially measured at fair value. Gains and losses from initial measurement and any changes in fair value are subsequently recognized in earnings.\nInterest income related to changes in the fair values of these financial instruments is recorded on the Consolidated Income Statement in Other interest income, except for certain residential mortgage loans, for which income is recorded in Loans interest income. Changes in the value on prepaid forward contracts included in Other assets is reported in Noninterest expense and interest expense on the Other borrowed funds is reported in Borrowed funds interest expense.\n156\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\nFair values and aggregate unpaid principal balances of items for which we elected the fair value option are as follows:\nTable 90: Fair Value Option – Fair Value and Principal Balances\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nIn millions\nFair Value\nAggregate Unpaid Principal Balance\nDifference\nFair Value\nAggregate Unpaid Principal Balance\nDifference\nAssets\nResidential mortgage loans held for sale\nAccruing loans less than 90 days past due\n$\n588\n \n$\n588\n \n$\n432\n \n$\n429\n \n$\n3\n \nAccruing loans 90 days or more past due\n11\n \n11\n \n6\n \n6\n \nNonaccrual loans\n29\n \n36\n \n$\n(\n7\n)\n36\n \n43\n \n(\n7\n)\nTotal\n$\n628\n \n$\n635\n \n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n474\n \n$\n478\n \n$\n(\n4\n)\nCommercial mortgage loans held for sale (a) (b)\nAccruing loans less than 90 days past due\n$\n203\n \n$\n200\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n238\n \n$\n228\n \n$\n10\n \nLoans\nAccruing loans less than 90 days past due\n$\n494\n \n$\n505\n \n$\n(\n11\n)\n$\n507\n \n$\n520\n \n$\n(\n13\n)\nAccruing loans 90 days or more past due\n126\n \n137\n \n(\n11\n)\n146\n \n156\n \n(\n10\n)\nNonaccrual loans\n536\n \n718\n \n(\n182\n)\n585\n \n793\n \n(\n208\n)\nTotal\n$\n1,156\n \n$\n1,360\n \n$\n(\n204\n)\n$\n1,238\n \n$\n1,469\n \n$\n(\n231\n)\nOther assets\n$\n133\n \n$\n142\n \n$\n(\n9\n)\n$\n85\n \n$\n69\n \n$\n16\n \nLiabilities\nOther borrowed funds\n$\n34\n \n$\n35\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n39\n \n$\n40\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\nOther liabilities with contractual unpaid principal balance\n$\n28\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n(\n4\n)\nOther liabilities without contractual unpaid principal balance\n$\n106\n \n \n$\n106\n \n$\n124\n \n$\n124\n \n(a)\nThere were no accruing loans 90 days or more past due within this category at December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n(b)\nThere were no nonaccrual loans within this category at December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n \nThe changes in fair value for items for which we elected the fair value option are as follows:\n Table 91: Fair Value Option – Changes in Fair Value (a)\nYear ended December 31\nIn millions\nGains (Losses)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAssets\nResidential mortgage loans held for sale\n$\n10\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n(\n80\n)\nCommercial mortgage loans held for sale\n$\n24\n \n$\n53\n \n$\n52\n \nLoans\n$\n21\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n42\n \nOther assets\n$\n25\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n(\n16\n)\nLiabilities\nOther liabilities\n$\n(\n19\n)\n$\n(\n41\n)\n$\n(\n67\n)\n(a)\nThe impact on earnings of offsetting hedged items or hedging instruments is not reflected in these amounts.\nAdditional Fair Value Information Related to Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value\nThis section presents fair value information for all other financial instruments that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value amounts for these financial instruments.\nCash and Due from Banks and Interest-earning Deposits with Banks\nDue to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts for Cash and due from banks and Interest-earning deposits with banks reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate fair value.\nSecurities Held-to-Maturity\nWe primarily use prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. Refer to the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note 14 for additional information relating to our pricing processes and procedures.\nNet Loans\nFair values are estimated based on the discounted value of expected net cash flows incorporating assumptions about prepayment rates, net credit losses and servicing fees. Nonaccrual loans are valued at their estimated recovery value. The carrying value of Net loans are presented net of the ALLL.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n157\nOther Assets\nThe carrying value of Other assets, which include accrued interest receivable, cash collateral, federal funds sold and resale agreements, certain loans held for sale, and FHLB and FRB stock, approximates fair value. The aggregate carrying value of our FHLB and FRB stock was $\n2.1\n billion and $\n2.7\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDeposits\nFor time deposits, fair values are estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturities.  \nBorrowed Funds\nFor short-term borrowed funds, including federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements and certain other short-term borrowings and payables, carrying value approximates fair value. For long-term borrowed funds, quoted market prices are used, when available, to estimate fair value. When quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on current market interest rates and credit spreads for debt with similar terms and maturities.\nUnfunded Lending Related Commitments \nThe fair value of unfunded lending related commitments is determined by market participant assumptions and takes into consideration the impact of changes in interest rates and credit. We establish a liability on these facilities based on the creditworthiness of our counterparty.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities includes interest-bearing cash collateral held related to derivatives and other accrued liabilities. Due to its short-term nature, the carrying value of Other liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value.\n158\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values, as well as the level within the fair value hierarchy, of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:    \nTable 92: Additional Fair Value Information Related to Other Financial Instruments \nIn millions\nCarrying\nAmount\nFair Value\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n \n \n \n \nAssets\nCash and due from banks\n$\n6,904\n \n$\n6,904\n \n$\n6,904\n \nInterest-earning deposits with banks (a)\n39,347\n \n39,347\n \n38,993\n \n$\n354\n \nSecurities held-to-maturity\n77,698\n \n73,058\n \n23,992\n \n48,914\n \n$\n152\n \nNet loans (excludes leases)\n304,129\n \n298,241\n \n298,241\n \nOther assets\n5,722\n \n5,722\n \n5,713\n \n9\n \nTotal assets\n$\n433,800\n \n$\n423,272\n \n$\n69,889\n \n$\n54,981\n \n$\n298,402\n \nLiabilities\nTime deposits\n$\n34,339\n \n$\n34,383\n \n$\n34,383\n \nBorrowed funds\n60,302\n \n61,260\n \n60,350\n \n$\n910\n \nUnfunded lending related commitments\n719\n \n719\n \n719\n \nOther liabilities\n1,058\n \n1,058\n \n1,058\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n96,418\n \n$\n97,420\n \n \n$\n95,791\n \n$\n1,629\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets\nCash and due from banks\n$\n6,921\n \n$\n6,921\n \n$\n6,921\n \nInterest-earning deposits with banks (a)\n43,804\n \n43,804\n \n43,313\n \n$\n491\n \nSecurities held-to-maturity\n90,790\n \n86,948\n \n30,943\n \n55,850\n \n$\n155\n \nNet loans (excludes leases)\n308,936\n \n299,645\n \n299,645\n \nOther assets\n5,872\n \n5,872\n \n5,872\n \n \nTotal assets\n$\n456,323\n \n$\n443,190\n \n$\n81,177\n \n$\n62,213\n \n$\n299,800\n \nLiabilities\nTime deposits\n$\n31,569\n \n$\n31,602\n \n$\n31,602\n \nBorrowed funds\n71,816\n \n72,369\n \n71,194\n \n$\n1,175\n \nUnfunded lending related commitments\n663\n \n663\n \n663\n \nOther liabilities\n1,091\n \n1,091\n \n1,091\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n105,139\n \n$\n105,725\n \n \n$\n103,887\n \n$\n1,838\n \n(a)\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we reclassified balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank from Level 2 to Level 1 to align with our updated cash and cash equivalents policy.

We manage these risks as part of our overall asset and liability management process and through our credit policies and procedures. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.\nDerivative transactions are often measured in terms of notional amount, but this amount is generally not exchanged and it is not recorded on the balance sheet. The notional amount is the basis to which the underlying is applied to determine required payments under the derivative contract. The underlying is a referenced interest rate, security price, credit spread or other index. Residential and commercial real estate loan commitments associated with loans to be sold also qualify as derivative instruments.\nThe following table\n presents the notional and gross fair value amounts of all derivative assets and liabilities held by us:\nTable 93: Total Gross Derivatives (a)\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nIn millions\nNotional /Contract Amount\nAsset Fair\nValue (b)\nLiability Fair\nValue (c)\nNotional /Contract Amount\nAsset Fair\nValue (b)\nLiability Fair\nValue (c)\nDerivatives used for hedging \nInterest rate contracts :\nFair value hedges (d)\n$\n53,750\n \n$\n32,079\n \nCash flow hedges (d)\n50,721\n \n$\n2\n \n33,302\n \n \nCash flow hedges - other (e) \n25,000\n \n$\n149\n \n168\n \n25,000\n \n$\n327\n \n$\n137\n \nForeign exchange contracts:\nNet investment hedges\n1,269\n \n14\n \n \n1,174\n \n2\n \nTotal derivatives designated for hedging \n$\n130,740\n \n$\n163\n \n$\n170\n \n$\n91,555\n \n$\n327\n \n$\n139\n \nDerivatives not used for hedging \nDerivatives used for mortgage banking activities (f):\nInterest rate contracts:\nSwaps \n$\n35,941\n \n \n$\n43,450\n \n \nFutures (g) \n9,962\n \n10,370\n \nMortgage-backed commitments\n4,815\n \n$\n73\n \n$\n66\n \n3,093\n \n$\n66\n \n$\n67\n \nOther\n13,098\n \n19\n \n13\n \n15,544\n \n46\n \n22\n \nTotal interest rate contracts \n63,816\n \n92\n \n79\n \n72,457\n \n112\n \n89\n \nDerivatives used for customer-related activities:\nInterest rate contracts:\nSwaps \n406,747\n \n1,544\n \n4,130\n \n401,607\n \n1,723\n \n4,228\n \nFutures (g) \n113\n \n73\n \nMortgage-backed commitments\n3,275\n \n21\n \n7\n \n2,592\n \n9\n \n25\n \nOther\n32,280\n \n123\n \n100\n \n28,489\n \n186\n \n169\n \nTotal interest rate contracts \n442,415\n \n1,688\n \n4,237\n \n432,761\n \n1,918\n \n4,422\n \nCommodity contracts:\nSwaps\n6,725\n \n313\n \n288\n \n6,714\n \n577\n \n569\n \nOther \n8,496\n \n208\n \n208\n \n4,797\n \n188\n \n188\n \nTotal commodity contracts\n15,221\n \n521\n \n496\n \n11,511\n \n765\n \n757\n \nForeign exchange contracts and other\n38,729\n \n403\n \n364\n \n32,885\n \n295\n \n239\n \nTotal derivatives for customer-related activities \n496,365\n \n2,612\n \n5,097\n \n477,157\n \n2,978\n \n5,418\n \nDerivatives used for other risk management activities:\nForeign exchange contracts and other \n11,031\n \n144\n \n149\n \n14,882\n \n12\n \n253\n \nTotal derivatives not designated for hedging \n$\n571,212\n \n$\n2,848\n \n$\n5,325\n \n$\n564,496\n \n$\n3,102\n \n$\n5,760\n \nTotal gross derivatives\n$\n701,952\n \n$\n3,011\n \n$\n5,495\n \n$\n656,051\n \n$\n3,429\n \n$\n5,899\n \nLess: Impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements \n1,298\n \n1,298\n \n1,406\n \n1,406\n \nLess: Cash collateral received/paid \n \n897\n \n1,029\n \n \n1,126\n \n955\n \nTotal derivatives\n \n$\n816\n \n$\n3,168\n \n$\n897\n \n$\n3,538\n \n(a)\nCentrally cleared derivatives are settled in cash daily and result in no derivative asset or derivative liability being recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b)\nIncluded in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(c)\nIncluded in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(d)\nRepresents primarily swaps.\n(e)\nRepresents caps and floors.\n(f)\nIncludes both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities.\n(g)\nFutures contracts are settled in cash daily and result in no derivative asset or derivative liability being recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet\n.\n160\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\nAll derivatives are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivative balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and, when appropriate, any related cash collateral exchanged with counterparties. Further discussion regarding the offsetting rights associated with these legally enforceable master netting agreements is included in the Offsetting and Counterparty Credit Risk section of this Note 15. Any nonperformance risk, including credit risk, is included in the determination of the estimated net fair value of the derivatives. Further discussion on how derivatives are accounted for is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies.\nDerivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments\nCertain derivatives used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk as part of our asset and liability risk management activities are designated as accounting hedges. Derivatives hedging the risks associated with changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges, derivatives hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges and derivatives hedging a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are considered net investment hedges. Designating derivatives as accounting hedges allows for gains and losses on those derivatives to be recognized in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings impact of the hedged items.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate and zero-coupon investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps designated in these hedge relationships, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings within the same income statement line item.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. We also periodically enter into forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge the variability of the consideration that will be paid or received related to the purchase or sale of investment securities. The forecasted purchase or sale is consummated upon gross settlement of the forward contract itself. For these cash flow hedges, gains and losses on the hedging instruments are recorded in AOCI and are then reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged cash flows affect earnings and within the same income statement line as the hedged cash flows.\nIn the 12 months that follow December 31, 2024, we expect to reclassify net derivative losses of $\n0.6\n billion pretax, or $\n0.5\n billion after-tax, from AOCI to interest income for these cash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is \nten years\n.\n \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n161\nFurther detail regarding gains (losses) related to our fair value and cash flow hedge derivatives is presented in the following table:\nTable 94: Gains (Losses) Recognized on Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges in the Consolidated Income Statement (a) (b)\n \nLocation and Amount of Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income\n \nInterest Income \nInterest Expense\nNoninterest Income\nIn millions\nLoans\nInvestment Securities\nBorrowed Funds\nOther\nYear ended December 31, 2024\nTotal amounts on the Consolidated Income Statement\n$\n19,346\n \n$\n4,123\n \n$\n4,484\n \n$\n711\n \nGains (losses) on fair value hedges recognized on:\nHedged items (c)\n$\n(\n182\n)\n$\n320\n \nDerivatives\n$\n183\n \n$\n(\n357\n)\nAmounts related to interest settlements on derivatives\n$\n128\n \n$\n(\n694\n)\nGains (losses) on cash flow hedges (d):\nAmount of derivative gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated \n   other comprehensive income\n$\n(\n1,257\n)\n$\n(\n32\n)\n$\n(\n28\n)\nOther amounts related to interest settlements on derivatives\n$\n52\n \nYear ended December 31, 2023\nTotal amounts on the Consolidated Income Statement\n$\n18,299\n \n$\n3,545\n \n$\n3,783\n \n$\n619\n \nGains (losses) on fair value hedges recognized on:\nHedged items (c)\n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n545\n)\nDerivatives\n$\n2\n \n$\n531\n \nAmounts related to interest settlements on derivatives\n$\n28\n \n$\n(\n605\n)\nGains (losses) on cash flow hedges (d):\nAmount of derivative gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated \n   other comprehensive income \n$\n(\n1,512\n)\n$\n(\n28\n)\nOther amounts related to interest settlements on derivatives\n$\n115\n \nYear ended December 31, 2022\nTotal amounts on the Consolidated Income Statement\n$\n11,795\n \n$\n2,726\n \n$\n1,155\n \n$\n952\n \nGains (losses) on fair value hedges recognized on:\nHedged items (c)\n$\n(\n136\n)\n$\n1,945\n \nDerivatives\n$\n143\n \n$\n(\n1,976\n)\nAmounts related to interest settlements on derivatives\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n120\n \nGains (losses) on cash flow hedges (d):\nAmount of derivative gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated \n   other comprehensive income \n$\n(\n259\n)\n$\n(\n1\n)\nOther amounts related to interest settlements on derivatives\n$\n41\n \n(a)\nFor all periods presented, there were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for any of the fair value or cash flow hedge strategies.\n(b)\nAll cash flow and fair value hedge derivatives were interest rate contracts for the periods presented.\n(c)\nIncludes an insignificant amount of fair value hedge adjustments related to discontinued hedge relationships.\n(d)\nFor all periods presented, there were no gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives reclassified to income because it became probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.\nDetail regarding the impact of fair value hedge accounting on the carrying value of the hedged items is presented in the following table:\nTable 95: Hedged Items - Fair Value Hedges\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nIn millions\nCarrying Value of the Hedged Items\nCumulative Fair Value Hedge Adjustment included in the Carrying Value of Hedged Items (a)\nCarrying Value of the Hedged Items\nCumulative Fair Value Hedge Adjustment included in the Carrying Value of Hedged Items (a)\nInvestment securities - available-for-sale (b)\n$\n18,716\n \n$\n(\n305\n)\n$\n2,076\n \n$\n(\n122\n)\nBorrowed funds\n$\n35,139\n \n$\n(\n1,057\n)\n$\n30,503\n \n$\n(\n737\n)\n(a)\nIncludes fair value hedge adjustments of less than $(\n0.1\n) billion related to discontinued available-for-sale securities and borrowed funds hedge relationships at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n(b)\nCarrying value shown represents amortized cost.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar net investments in foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We assess whether the hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge and hedged item match at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Net investment hedge derivatives are classified as foreign exchange \n162\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\ncontracts. There were \nno\n components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness for the periods presented. Net gains (losses) on net investment hedge derivatives recognized in OCI were $\n24\n million, $(\n53\n) million and $\n119\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nDerivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments\nResidential mortgage loans that will be sold in the secondary market, and the related loan commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the loans and commitments due to interest rate risk are hedged with forward contracts to sell mortgage-backed securities, as well as U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options. Gains and losses on the loans and commitments held for sale and the derivatives used to economically hedge them are included in Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nResidential mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value influenced primarily by changes in interest rates. Derivatives used to hedge the fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights include interest rate futures, swaps, options and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses on residential mortgage servicing rights and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income.\nCommercial mortgage loans held for sale and the related loan commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. Derivatives used to economically hedge these loans and commitments from changes in fair value due to interest rate risk include forward loan sale contracts and interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on the commitments, loans and derivatives are included in Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income. Derivatives used to economically hedge the change in value of commercial mortgage servicing rights include interest rate futures, swaps and options. Gains or losses on these derivatives are included in Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income.\nThe residential and commercial mortgage loan commitments associated with loans to be sold which are accounted for as derivatives are valued based on the estimated fair value of the underlying loan and the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the commitment. The fair value also takes into account the fair value of the embedded servicing right.\nWe offer derivatives to our customers in connection with their risk management needs. These derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions, foreign exchange contracts and commodity swaps. We primarily manage our market risk exposure from customer transactions by entering into a variety of hedging transactions with third-party dealers. Gains and losses on customer-related derivatives are included in Capital markets and advisory noninterest income.\nIncluded in the customer, mortgage banking risk management, and other risk management portfolios are written interest-rate caps and floors entered into with customers and for risk management purposes. We receive an upfront premium from the counterparty and are obligated to make payments to the counterparty if the underlying market interest rate rises above or falls below a certain level designated in the contract. Our ultimate obligation under written options is based on future market conditions.\nWe have entered into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue. The following table presents the notional amount of risk participation agreements sold and maximum potential exposures at December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nTable 96: Risk Participation Agreements \n \n December 31\nIn billions\n2024\n2023\nRisk participation agreements:\nSold - notional amount\n$\n7.4\n \n$\n8.0\n \nMaximum potential amount of exposure (a)\n$\n0.1\n \n$\n0.2\n \n(a)\nBased on the fair value of the underlying swaps assuming all underlying third party customers referenced in the swap contracts defaulted.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n163\nFurther detail regarding the gains (losses) on derivatives not designated in hedging relationships is presented in the following table:\nTable 97: Gains (Losses) on Derivatives Not Designated for Hedging\n \nYear ended December 31\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDerivatives used for mortgage banking activities:\nInterest rate contracts (a)\n$\n(\n201\n)\n$\n(\n70\n)\n$\n(\n671\n)\nDerivatives used for customer-related activities:\nInterest rate contracts\n(\n26\n)\n(\n15\n)\n220\n \nForeign exchange contracts and other\n149\n \n220\n \n111\n \nGains from customer-related activities (b)\n123\n \n205\n \n331\n \nDerivatives used for other risk management activities:\nForeign exchange contracts and other (b)\n86\n \n(\n395\n)\n255\n \nTotal gains (losses) from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments\n$\n8\n \n$\n(\n260\n)\n$\n(\n85\n)\n(a)\nIncluded in Residential and commercial mortgage noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.\n(b)\nIncluded in Capital markets and advisory and Other noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.\nOffsetting and Counterparty Credit Risk\nWe generally utilize a net presentation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those derivative financial instruments entered into with counterparties under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting agreement with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of an event of default. The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to collateralize either party’s net position. Collateral is typically exchanged daily on unsettled positions based on the net fair value of the positions with the counterparty as of the preceding day. Collateral representing initial margin, which is based on potential future exposure, may also be required to be exchanged. In certain cases, minimum thresholds must be exceeded before any collateral is exchanged. Any cash collateral exchanged with counterparties under these master netting agreements is also netted, when appropriate, against the applicable derivative fair values on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, the fair value of any securities held or pledged is not included in the net presentation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In order for derivative instruments under a master netting agreement to be eligible for closeout netting under GAAP, we must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis that the offsetting rights included in the master netting agreement would be legally enforceable upon an event of default, including upon an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a similar proceeding of the counterparty. Enforceability is evidenced by a legal opinion that supports, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement in such circumstances.\nTable 98 shows the impact legally enforceable master netting agreements had on our derivative assets and derivative liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The table includes cash collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The table also includes the fair value of any securities collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash and securities collateral amounts are included in the table only to the extent of the related net derivative fair values.\nTable 98 includes OTC derivatives not settled through an exchange (“OTC derivatives”) and OTC derivatives cleared through a central clearing house (“OTC cleared derivatives”). OTC derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties that are not settled through an organized exchange or directly cleared through a central clearing house. The majority of OTC derivatives are governed by the ISDA documentation or other legally enforceable master netting agreements. OTC cleared derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market that are novated to a central clearing house that then becomes our counterparty. OTC cleared derivative instruments are typically settled in cash each day based on the prior day value.\n164\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\nTable 98: Derivative Assets and Liabilities Offsetting\nIn millions\nGross Fair Value\nAmounts Offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nNet Fair Value\n \nSecurities Collateral Held /Pledged Under Master Netting Agreements\nNet Amounts\nFair Value Offset Amount\nCash Collateral\nDecember 31, 2024\nDerivative assets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInterest rate contracts:\nOver-the-counter cleared \n$\n35\n \n$\n35\n \n \n$\n35\n \nOver-the-counter\n1,894\n \n$\n843\n \n$\n629\n \n422\n \n \n$\n38\n \n384\n \nCommodity contracts\n521\n \n296\n \n85\n \n140\n \n5\n \n135\n \nForeign exchange and other contracts\n561\n \n159\n \n183\n \n219\n \n \n2\n \n217\n \nTotal derivative assets\n$\n3,011\n \n$\n1,298\n \n$\n897\n \n$\n816\n \n(a)\n$\n45\n \n$\n771\n \nDerivative liabilities\nInterest rate contracts:\nOver-the-counter cleared \n$\n17\n \n$\n17\n \n \n$\n17\n \nOver-the-counter\n4,469\n \n$\n732\n \n$\n1,019\n \n2,718\n \n \n$\n57\n \n2,661\n \nCommodity contracts\n496\n \n393\n \n2\n \n101\n \n \n101\n \nForeign exchange and other contracts\n513\n \n173\n \n8\n \n332\n \n \n332\n \nTotal derivative liabilities\n$\n5,495\n \n$\n1,298\n \n$\n1,029\n \n$\n3,168\n \n(b)\n$\n57\n \n$\n3,111\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \nDerivative assets\nInterest rate contracts:\nOver-the-counter cleared \n$\n19\n \n$\n19\n \n \n$\n19\n \nOver-the-counter\n2,338\n \n$\n976\n \n$\n767\n \n595\n \n \n$\n61\n \n534\n \nCommodity contracts\n765\n \n316\n \n283\n \n166\n \n5\n161\n \nForeign exchange and other contracts\n307\n \n114\n \n76\n \n117\n \n \n117\n \nTotal derivative assets\n$\n3,429\n \n$\n1,406\n \n$\n1,126\n \n$\n897\n \n(a)\n$\n66\n \n$\n831\n \nDerivative liabilities\nInterest rate contracts:\nOver-the-counter cleared \n$\n36\n \n$\n36\n \n \n$\n36\n \nOver-the-counter\n4,612\n \n$\n885\n \n$\n942\n \n2,785\n \n \n$\n58\n \n2,727\n \nCommodity contracts\n757\n \n332\n \n \n425\n \n \n425\n \nForeign exchange and other contracts\n494\n \n189\n \n13\n \n292\n \n \n292\n \nTotal derivative liabilities\n$\n5,899\n \n$\n1,406\n \n$\n955\n \n$\n3,538\n \n(b)\n$\n58\n \n$\n3,480\n \n(a)\nRepresents the net amount of derivative assets included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b)\nRepresents the net amount of derivative liabilities included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn addition to using master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to reduce credit risk associated with derivative instruments, we also seek to manage credit risk by evaluating credit ratings of counterparties and by using internal credit analysis, limits and monitoring procedures.\nAt December 31, 2024, cash and debt securities (primarily agency mortgage-backed securities) totaling $\n2.4\n billion were pledged to us under master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to collateralize net derivative assets due from counterparties and to meet initial margin requirements, and we pledged cash and debt securities (primarily agency mortgage-backed securities) totaling $\n2.3\n billion under these agreements to collateralize net derivative liabilities owed to counterparties and to meet initial margin requirements. These totals may differ from the amounts presented in the preceding offsetting table because these totals may include collateral exchanged under an agreement that does not qualify as a master netting agreement or because the total amount of collateral pledged exceeds the net derivative fair values with the counterparty as of the balance sheet date due to timing or other factors, such as initial margin. To the extent not netted against the derivative fair values under a master netting agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is included in Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities pledged to us by counterparties are not recognized on our balance sheet. Likewise, securities we have pledged to counterparties remain on our balance sheet.\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features\nCertain derivative agreements contain various credit-risk-related contingent provisions, such as those that require our debt to maintain a specified credit rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt ratings were to fall below such specified ratings, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The following table presents the aggregate fair value of derivative \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n165\ninstruments with credit-risk-related contingent features, the associated collateral posted in the normal course of business and the maximum amount of collateral we would be required to post if the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nTable 99: Credit-Risk Contingent Features\n \nDecember 31\nIn billions\n2024\n2023\nNet derivative liabilities with credit-risk contingent features\n$\n3.9\n \n$\n4.2\n \nCollateral posted \n1.1\n \n1.0\n \nMaximum additional amount of collateral exposure \n$\n2.8\n \n$\n3.2\n \nN\nOTE \n16 \nE\nMPLOYEE\n B\nENEFIT\n P\nLANS                                 \nPension and Postretirement Plans\nWe have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation. Earnings credit percentages for those employees who were plan participants on December 31, 2009 are frozen at the level earned to that point. Earnings credits for all employees who became participants on or after January 1, 2010 are a flat 3% of eligible compensation. All participants as of December 31, 2009 earn a minimum rate on their cash balances; new participants on or after January 1, 2010 earn interest credits on their cash balances based on 30-year Treasury securities. New participants on or after January 1, 2010 are not subject to the minimum rate. The plan provides for a minimum annual earnings credit amount of $\n2,000\n, subject to eligibility criteria. Pension contributions to the plan are typically based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Assets of the qualified pension plan are held in a separate Trust. \nWe also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees and provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees (postretirement benefits) through various plans. PNC reserves the right to terminate or make changes to these plans at any time. The nonqualified pension plan is unfunded. Contributions from PNC, and participant contributions in the case of the postretirement benefit plans, cover all benefits paid under the nonqualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement plan provides benefits to certain retirees that are at least actuarially equivalent to those provided by Medicare Part D and accordingly, we receive a federal subsidy. PNC has established a VEBA to partially fund future postretirement medical and life insurance benefit obligations.\nWe use a measurement date of December 31 for plan assets and benefit obligations. \n166\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\nA reconciliation of the changes in the projected benefit obligation for qualified pension, nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as the change in plan assets for the qualified pension and postretirement benefit plans follows:\nTable 100: Reconciliation of Changes in Projected Benefit Obligation and Change in Plan Assets \n \nQualified\nPension (a)\nNonqualified\nPension\nPostretirement\nBenefits\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nAccumulated benefit obligation at December 31\n$\n4,496\n \n$\n4,601\n \n$\n205\n \n$\n212\n \nProjected benefit obligation at January 1\n$\n4,641\n \n$\n4,543\n \n$\n217\n \n$\n222\n \n$\n261\n \n$\n260\n \nService cost\n128\n \n130\n \n3\n \n3\n \n3\n \n3\n \nInterest cost\n240\n \n249\n \n11\n \n11\n \n13\n \n14\n \nActuarial (gains)/losses and changes in assumptions (a)\n(\n91\n)\n45\n \n3\n \n(\n12\n)\n7\n \nParticipant contributions\n \n \n2\n \n2\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n389\n)\n(\n326\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n24\n)\n(\n25\n)\nProjected benefit obligation at December 31\n$\n4,529\n \n$\n4,641\n \n$\n210\n \n$\n217\n \n$\n243\n \n$\n261\n \nFair value of plan assets at January 1\n$\n5,615\n \n$\n5,400\n \n$\n257\n \n$\n242\n \nActual return on plan assets\n280\n \n541\n \n3\n \n16\n \nEmployer contribution\n \n$\n21\n \n$\n22\n \n22\n \n22\n \nParticipant contributions\n \n \n2\n \n2\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n389\n)\n(\n326\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n24\n)\n(\n25\n)\nFair value of plan assets at December 31\n$\n5,506\n \n$\n5,615\n \n$\n260\n \n$\n257\n \nFunded status\n$\n977\n \n$\n974\n \n$\n(\n210\n)\n$\n(\n217\n)\n$\n17\n \n$\n(\n4\n)\nAmounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheet\nNoncurrent asset\n$\n977\n \n$\n974\n \n$\n46\n \n$\n26\n \nCurrent liability\n \n$\n(\n24\n)\n$\n(\n23\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nNoncurrent liability\n \n(\n186\n)\n(\n194\n)\n(\n26\n)\n(\n27\n)\nNet amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheet\n$\n977\n \n$\n974\n \n$\n(\n210\n)\n$\n(\n217\n)\n$\n17\n \n$\n(\n4\n)\nAmounts recognized in AOCI consist of:\nPrior service cost (credit)\n$\n7\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \nNet actuarial (gain)/loss\n135\n \n148\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n33\n \n(\n34\n)\n(\n31\n)\nAmount of (gain)/loss recognized in AOCI\n$\n142\n \n$\n159\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n33\n \n$\n(\n33\n)\n$\n(\n30\n)\n(a)\nThe actuarial (gains)/losses and changes in assumptions in 2024 and 2023 were primarily related to a change in the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation.\nPNC Pension Plan Assets\nThe long-term investment strategy for pension plan assets in our qualified pension plan (the Plan) is to:\n•\nMeet present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries,\n•\nCover reasonable expenses incurred to provide such benefits, including expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust and the Plan,\n•\nProvide sufficient liquidity to meet benefit and expense payment requirements on a timely basis, and\n•\nProvide a total return that, over the long term, maximizes the ratio of trust assets to liabilities by maximizing investment return, at an appropriate level of risk.\nThe Plan’s named investment fiduciary has the ability to make short to intermediate term asset allocation shifts under the dynamic asset allocation strategy based on factors such as the Plan’s funded status, the named investment fiduciary’s view of return on equities relative to long term expectations, the named investment fiduciary’s view on the direction of interest rates and credit spreads, and other relevant financial or economic factors which would be expected to impact the ability of the Trust to meet its obligation to participants and beneficiaries. Accordingly, the allowable asset allocation ranges have been updated to incorporate the flexibility required by the dynamic allocation policy.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n167\nThe asset strategy allocations for the Plan at the end of 2024 and 2023, and the target allocation range at the end of 2024, by asset category, are as follows:\nTable 101: Asset Strategy Allocations \n \nTarget Allocation Range\nPercentage of Plan Assets by Strategy at December 31\n  \n2024\n2023\nAsset Category\nDomestic equity\n15\n – \n40\n%\n21\n \n%\n22\n \n%\nInternational equity\n10\n – \n25\n%\n17\n \n%\n19\n \n%\nPrivate equity\n0\n – \n15\n%\n12\n \n%\n11\n \n%\nTotal equity\n30\n – \n70\n%\n50\n \n%\n52\n \n%\nDomestic fixed income\n10\n – \n40\n% \n31\n \n%\n29\n \n%\nHigh yield fixed income\n0\n – \n25\n% \n8\n \n%\n9\n \n%\nTotal fixed income\n10\n – \n65\n% \n39\n \n%\n38\n \n%\nReal estate\n0\n – \n10\n% \n6\n \n%\n6\n \n%\nOther\n0\n – \n20\n%\n5\n \n%\n4\n \n%\nTotal\n100\n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\nThe asset category represents the allocation of Plan assets in accordance with the investment objective of each of the Plan’s investment managers.

Other investment managers may invest in eligible securities outside of their assigned asset category to meet their investment objectives. The actual percentage of the fair value of total Plan assets held as of December 31, 2024 for equity securities, fixed income securities, real estate and all other assets are \n63\n%, \n25\n%, \n6\n% and \n6\n%, respectively.\nWe believe that, over the long term, asset allocation is the single greatest determinant of risk. Asset allocation will deviate from the target percentages due to market movement, cash flows, investment manager performance and implementation of shifts under the dynamic asset allocation policy. Material deviations from the asset allocation targets can alter the expected return and risk of the Trust. However, frequent rebalancing of the asset allocation targets may result in significant transaction costs, which can impair the Trust’s ability to meet its investment objective. Accordingly, the Trust portfolio is periodically rebalanced to maintain asset allocation within the target ranges described above.\nIn addition to being diversified across asset classes, the Trust is diversified within each asset class. Secondary diversification provides a reasonable basis for the expectation that no single security or class of securities will have a disproportionate impact on the total risk and return of the Trust.\nWhere investment strategies permit the use of derivatives and/or currency management, language is incorporated in the managers’ guidelines to define allowable and prohibited transactions and/or strategies. Derivatives are typically employed by investment managers to modify risk/return characteristics of their portfolio(s), implement asset allocation changes in a cost effective manner, or reduce transaction costs. Under the managers’ investment guidelines, derivatives may not be used solely for speculation or leverage. Derivatives are to be used only in circumstances where they offer the most efficient economic means of improving the risk/reward profile of the portfolio.\n168\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\nFair Value Measurements \nAs further described in Note 14 Fair Value, GAAP establishes the framework for measuring fair value, including a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value.\nA description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 follows:\nTable 102: Pension Plan Valuation Methodologies\nAsset\nValuation Methodology\nMoney market funds\n• Valued at the NAV of the shares held by the pension plan at year end.\nU.S. government and agency  securities\nCorporate debt\nCommon stock\n• Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.\n• If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Such securities are generally classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy but may be a Level 3 depending on the level of liquidity and activity in the market for the security.\nMutual funds\n• Valued based on third-party pricing of the fund that is not actively traded.\nOther investments\n   Derivative financial instruments\n   Group annuity contracts\n   Preferred stock\n• Derivative financial instruments - recorded at estimated fair value as determined by third-party appraisals and pricing models.\n• Group annuity contracts - measured at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations considering the creditworthiness of the issuer.\n• Preferred stock - valued at the closing price reported on an active market on which the securities are traded.\nInvestments measured at NAV\n   Collective trust fund investments\n   Limited partnerships\n• Collective trust fund investments - valued based upon the units of such collective trust fund held by the Plan at year end multiplied by the respective unit value. The unit value of the collective trust fund is based upon significant observable inputs, although it is not based upon quoted prices in an active market. The underlying investments of the collective trust funds consist primarily of equity securities, debt obligations, short-term investments, and other marketable securities. Due to the nature of these securities, there are no unfunded commitments or redemption restrictions.\n• Limited partnerships - valued by investment managers based on recent financial information used to estimate fair value. The unit value of limited partnerships is based upon significant observable inputs, although it is not based upon quoted marked prices in an active market.\nThese methods may result in fair value calculations that may not be indicative of net realizable values or future fair values. Furthermore, while the pension plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nThe following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Plan’s assets at fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTable 103: Pension Plan Assets - Fair Value Hierarchy\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nIn millions\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal Fair Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal Fair Value\nInterest-bearing cash\n$\n56\n \n \n$\n56\n \n$\n46\n \n \n$\n46\n \nMoney market funds\n220\n \n220\n \n186\n \n186\n \nU.S. government and agency securities\n391\n \n$\n302\n \n693\n \n394\n \n$\n145\n \n539\n \nCorporate debt\n684\n \n$\n1\n \n685\n \n \n749\n \n$\n2\n \n751\n \nCommon stock\n410\n \n \n410\n \n716\n \n \n \n716\n \nMutual funds\n147\n \n147\n \n160\n \n160\n \nOther\n1\n \n40\n \n41\n \n \n32\n \n \n32\n \nInvestments measured at NAV (a)\n3,254\n \n3,185\n \nTotal\n$\n1,078\n \n$\n1,173\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n5,506\n \n$\n1,342\n \n$\n1,086\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n5,615\n \n(a)\nCertain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n169\nThe following table provides information regarding our estimated future cash flows related to our various plans.\nTable 104: Estimated Cash Flows \n \nPension Plans\nPostretirement Benefits\nIn millions\nQualified Pension\nNonqualified Pension\nEstimated 2025 employer contributions\n$\n24\n \n$\n22\n \nEstimated future benefit payments\n2025\n$\n335\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n22\n \n2026\n$\n345\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n22\n \n2027\n$\n347\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n22\n \n2028\n$\n350\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n21\n \n2029\n$\n347\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n21\n \n2030-2034\n$\n1,709\n \n$\n89\n \n$\n100\n \nThe qualified pension plan contributions are deposited into the Trust, and the qualified pension plan benefit payments are paid from the Trust.

For this analysis, \n10\n% of bonds with the highest yields and \n40\n% with the lowest yields were removed from the bond universe.\nWith all other assumptions held constant, a \n0.50\n% decline in the discount rate would have resulted in an immaterial change in net periodic benefit cost in 2024 and to be recognized in 2025 for each of the qualified pension, nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans.\n \nThe expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes. For purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption, “long-term” refers to the period over which the plan’s projected benefit obligations will be disbursed. We review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted. Our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment, but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations. We also examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies. Taking into account all of these factors, the expected long-term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2024 was \n6.60\n%. We are decreasing our expected long-term return on assets to \n6.10\n% for determining pension cost for 2025. This decision was made after considering the views of both \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n171\ninternal and external capital market advisors, particularly with regard to the effects of the recent economic environment on long-term prospective equity and fixed income returns.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe ISP is a qualified defined contribution plan that covers all of our eligible employees. Newly-hired full time employees and part-time employees who are eligible to participate in the ISP are automatically enrolled in the ISP with a deferral rate equal to \n4\n% of eligible compensation in the absence of an affirmative election otherwise. Employee benefits expense related to the ISP was $\n182\n million in 2024, $\n188\n million in 2023 and $\n175\n million in 2022, representing cash contributed to the ISP by PNC.\nThe ISP is a 401(k) Plan and includes a frozen employee stock ownership feature. Employee contributions are invested in a number of investment options, including pre-mixed portfolios and individual core funds, available under the ISP at the direction of the employee.\n \nN\nOTE\n 17 \nS\nTOCK\n B\nASED\n C\nOMPENSATION\n P\nLANS\nWe have long-term incentive award plans (Incentive Plans) that provide for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, restricted share units, other share-based awards and dollar-denominated awards to executives and, other than incentive stock options, to non-employee directors. Certain Incentive Plan awards may be paid in stock, cash or a combination of stock and cash. We typically grant a substantial portion of our stock-based compensation awards during the first quarter of each year. \nPerformance Share Unit Awards and Restricted Share Unit Awards\nPNC grants share unit awards that are based on performance, service and certain metrics tied to market conditions. The fair value of nonvested performance share unit awards and restricted share unit awards is initially determined based on prices not less than the market value of our common stock on the date of grant with a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Fair value of some performance awards are based on a Monte Carlo model, with subsequent remeasurement based on the achievement of one or more performance goals. Additionally, certain performance share unit awards could require subsequent adjustment due to certain discretionary risk review triggers.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of performance share unit awards and restricted share unit awards granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n141.75\n, $\n154.91\n and $\n198.28\n per share, respectively.

PNC elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on CET1 capital through December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition period. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital is defined as the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC entered a three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard was phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, CECL will be fully reflected in regulatory capital.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, PNC and PNC Bank were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements.\nThe following table sets forth the Basel III regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2024 and 2023, for PNC and PNC Bank:\nTable 115: Basel Regulatory Capital (a)\n \nAmount\nRatios\nDecember 31\nDollars in millions\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n“Well Capitalized” Requirements\nRisk-based capital\nCommon equity Tier 1\nPNC\n$\n44,467\n \n$\n41,974\n \n10.5\n \n%\n9.9\n \n%\nN/A\n(b) (c)\nPNC Bank\n$\n49,306\n \n$\n47,273\n \n11.9\n \n%\n11.3\n \n%\n6.5\n \n%\nTier 1\nPNC\n$\n50,216\n \n$\n48,215\n \n11.9\n \n%\n11.4\n \n%\n6.0\n \n%\nPNC Bank\n$\n49,306\n \n$\n47,273\n \n11.9\n \n%\n11.3\n \n%\n8.0\n \n%\nTotal\nPNC\n$\n57,330\n \n$\n55,932\n \n13.6\n \n%\n13.2\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\nPNC Bank\n$\n55,574\n \n$\n54,140\n \n13.4\n \n%\n12.9\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\nLeverage\nPNC\n$\n50,216\n \n$\n48,215\n \n9.0\n \n%\n8.7\n \n%\nN/A\n(b) (d)\nPNC Bank\n$\n49,306\n \n$\n47,273\n \n8.9\n \n%\n8.6\n \n%\n5.0\n \n%\n(a)\nCalculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to us during both 2024 and 2023.\n(b)\n“Well Capitalized” is not defined at the BHC level.\n(c)\nThe regulatory minimum required CET1 ratio of 4.5% plus SCB of 2.5% for PNC is 7.0%.\n(d)\nThe regulatory minimum required leverage ratio for PNC is 4.0%.\nThe principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends or other capital distributions it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following:\n•\nBank-level capital needs,\n•\nLaws, regulations and the results of supervisory activities,\n•\nCorporate policies,\n•\nContractual restrictions, and\n•\nOther factors.\nAlso, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank without prior regulatory approval was approximately $\n7.4\n billion at December 31, 2024.\nUnder federal law, a bank subsidiary generally may not extend credit to, or engage in other types of covered transactions (including the purchase of assets) with, the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries on terms and under circumstances that are not substantially the same as comparable transactions with nonaffiliates. A bank subsidiary may not extend credit to, or engage in a \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n175\ncovered transaction with, the parent company or a non-bank subsidiary if the aggregate amount of the bank’s extensions of credit and other covered transactions with the parent company or non-bank subsidiary exceeds 10% of the capital stock and surplus of such bank subsidiary or the aggregate amount of the bank’s extensions of credit and other covered transactions with the parent company and all non-bank subsidiaries exceeds 20% of the capital stock and surplus of such bank subsidiary. Such extensions of credit, with limited exceptions, must be at least fully collateralized in accordance with specified collateralization thresholds, with the thresholds varying based on the type of assets serving as collateral. In certain circumstances, federal regulatory authorities may impose more restrictive limitations. \nThe Federal Reserve is authorized to establish reserve requirements for certain types of deposits and other liabilities of depository institutions. Effective March 26, 2020, the reserve requirement ratios were reduced to zero. At December 31, 2024, the balance outstanding at the Federal Reserve Bank was $\n39.0\n billion. This amount is included in Interest-earning deposits with banks on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nFDIC Special Assessment\nIn November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule to implement a special assessment, in connection with the systemic risk determination announced in March 2023, to recover the cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Under the rule, the FDIC will collect from PNC, along with other BHCs and insured depository institutions, special assessments at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points of an institution’s uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022 (adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion), over eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning after the first quarter of 2024. Because the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund from the systemic risk determination are estimated, the FDIC will periodically adjust the estimate, which could result in extending the special assessment for additional quarters, imposing a final special assessment on a one-time basis if actual losses exceed the amounts collected, or cease collection early if the FDIC has collected enough to recover actual losses. Based on the rule, PNC incurred a pre-tax expense of $\n515\n million during the fourth quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, PNC incurred an additional pre-tax expense of $\n130\n million related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses. The fourth quarter of 2024 included an $\n18\n million pre-tax reduction of the FDIC special assessment.\nN\nOTE\n 20 \nL\nEGAL\n P\nROCEEDINGS\nWe establish accruals for legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for disclosed legal proceedings (“Disclosed Matters,” which are those matters disclosed in this Note 20). For Disclosed Matters where we are able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, as of December 31, 2024, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate amount less than $\n300\n million. The estimates included in this amount are based on our analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information is obtained we may change our estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\nIn our experience, legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. One or more of the following factors frequently contribute to this inherent unpredictability: the proceeding is in its early stages; the damages sought are unspecified, unsupported or uncertain; it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis or, if permitted to proceed as a class action, how the class will be defined; the other party is seeking relief other than or in addition to compensatory damages (including, in the case of regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, the possibility of fines and penalties); the matter presents meaningful legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; we have not engaged in meaningful settlement discussions; discovery has not started or is not complete; there are significant facts in dispute; the possible outcomes may not be amenable to the use of statistical or quantitative analytical tools; predicting possible outcomes depends on making assumptions about future decisions of courts or regulatory bodies or the behavior of other parties; and there are a large number of parties named as defendants (including where it is uncertain how damages or liability, if any, will be shared among multiple defendants). Generally, the less progress that has been made in the proceedings or the broader the range of potential results, the harder it is for us to estimate losses or ranges of losses that it is reasonably possible we could incur.\nAs a result of these types of factors, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be incurred or ranges of such losses with respect to some of the Disclosed Matters, and the aggregate estimated amount provided above does not include an estimate for every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate amount disclosed above does not include all of the Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate amount also does not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as discussed below under \n“\nOther.”\n176\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\nWe include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed Matters certain quantitative information related to the plaintiff\n’\ns claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff\n’\ns pleadings or other public filings or otherwise publicly available information. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual.\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. We do not consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals (although we would record the amount of related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to the amount of the accrual) or in determining any estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses.\nInterchange Litigation\nBeginning in June 2005, a series of antitrust lawsuits were filed against Visa\n®\n, Mastercard\n®\n, and several major financial institutions, including cases naming National City (since merged into The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.) and its subsidiary, National City Bank of Kentucky (since merged into National City Bank, which, in turn, was merged into PNC Bank). The plaintiffs in these cases are merchants operating commercial businesses throughout the U.S., as well as trade associations. Some of these cases (including those naming National City entities) were brought as class actions on behalf of all persons or business entities that have accepted Visa or Mastercard. The cases have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption \nIn re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation\n (Master File No. 1:05-md-1720- MKB-JAM).\nIn November 2016, the district court appointed separate interim class counsel for a proposed class seeking damages and a proposed class seeking equitable (injunctive) relief. In February 2017, each of these counsel filed a proposed amended and supplemental complaint on behalf of its respective proposed class. These complaints made similar allegations, including that the defendants conspired to monopolize and to fix the prices for general purpose card network services, that the restructuring of Visa and Mastercard, each of which included an initial public offering, violated the antitrust laws, and that the defendants otherwise imposed unreasonable restraints on trade, resulting in the payment of inflated interchange fees and other fees, which also violated the antitrust laws. In their complaints, collectively the plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief, unspecified damages (trebled under the antitrust laws) and attorneys’ fees. PNC is named as a defendant in the complaint seeking damages but is not named as a defendant in the complaint that seeks equitable relief.\nIn September 2018, the relevant parties entered an amended definitive agreement to resolve the claims of the class seeking damages. In this amended settlement agreement, the parties agreed, among other things, to the following terms:           \n•\nAn additional settlement payment from all defendants of $\n900\n million, with Visa’s share of the additional settlement payment being $\n600\n million. The additional settlement payment will be added to the approximately $\n5.3\n billion previously paid by the defendants pursuant to the original 2012 settlement agreement. \n•\nUp to $\n700\n million may be returned to the defendants (with up to $\n467\n million to Visa) if more than \n15\n% of class members (by payment volume) opt out of the class. As more than \n15\n% of class members opted out of the class, $\n700\n million has been returned to the defendants ($\n467\n million to Visa).\nThe district court granted final approval of the settlement in December 2019. Several objectors appealed the district court\n’\ns order granting final approval to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In March 2023, the court of appeals affirmed the district court\n’\ns approval in all material respects. Some merchants that opted out from this settlement (and from an earlier settlement that was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit) have brought lawsuits against Visa and Mastercard and one or more of the issuing banks. Resolution by Visa of claims by merchants that opted out of the settlement, including those that file lawsuits, have been or will be paid from the Visa litigation escrow account.\nIn July 2024, the district court determined that it had completed multi-district litigation proceedings for the opt-out cases and transferred them back to the courts in which they originated. Some of those opt-out cases are before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. \nSee Target Corporation et al., v. Visa Inc. et al.\n, No. 13 Civ. 3477 (AKH) (filed May 2013) and \n7-Eleven, Inc. et al.\n, \nv. Visa Inc. et al.\n, No. 13 Civ. 4443 (AKH) (filed June 2013). These complaints make allegations similar to those made in the class action complaints described above. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief, unspecified damages (trebled under the antitrust laws) and attorneys’ fees. Trial has been scheduled for October 2025 for six of the named plaintiffs in those two lawsuits. The plaintiffs selected by the court for this trial are generally the largest remaining opt-out merchants. PNC is not a named defendant in the complaints. \nIn March 2024, the parties to the class action seeking equitable relief in the proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption \nIn re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation\n (Master File No. 1:05-md-1720-MKB-JAM) entered into an agreement for certain rule and rate changes to resolve the matter. On June 25, 2024, the district court denied preliminary approval of the settlement. \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n177\nNational City and National City Bank entered into judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa and certain other banks with respect to all of the above referenced litigation. We were not originally named as defendants in any of the Visa or Mastercard related antitrust litigation nor were we initially parties to the judgment or loss sharing agreements. However, we became responsible for National City\n’\ns and National City Bank\n’\ns position in the litigation and responsibilities under the agreements through our acquisition of National City. In addition, following Visa\n’\ns reorganization in 2007 in contemplation of its initial public offering, U.S. Visa members received shares of Class B Visa common stock, convertible upon resolution of specified litigation, including the remaining litigation described above, into shares of Class A Visa common stock, with the conversion rate adjusted to reflect amounts paid or escrowed to resolve the specified litigation, and also remained responsible for indemnifying Visa against the specified litigation. Our Class B Visa common stock is all subject to this conversion adjustment provision, and we are now responsible for the indemnification obligations of our predecessors as well as ourselves. In January 2024, Visa\n’\ns stockholders approved amendments to its Certificate of Incorporation to institute a conversion and exchange offer program that resulted in the conversion of Visa\n’\ns Class B common stock to Class B-1 common stock and permitted Visa to release transfer restrictions on a portion of the redenominated Class B common stock. \nDuring the second quarter of 2024, PNC participated in this exchange program, allowing PNC to convert its Visa Class B-1 common shares into approximately equal amounts of Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa Class C common shares. PNC then sold the Visa Class C common shares and, as required, retained the Visa Class B-2 common shares. The Visa Class B-2 common shares remain subject to the same restrictions that were imposed on the Visa Class B-1 common shares. Participation in the exchange required PNC to agree to a make-whole agreement that subjects PNC to the same indemnity obligations to Visa as prior to participation in the exchange program.\nWe have also entered into a Mastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement with Mastercard and other financial institution defendants and an Omnibus Agreement Regarding Interchange Litigation Sharing and Settlement Sharing with Visa, Mastercard and other financial institution defendants. The Omnibus Agreement, in substance, apportions resolution of the claims in this litigation into a Visa portion and a Mastercard portion, with the Visa portion being two-thirds and the Mastercard portion being one-third. This apportionment only applies in the case of either a global settlement involving all defendants or an adverse judgment against the defendants, to the extent that damages either are related to the merchants’ inter-network conspiracy claims or are otherwise not attributed to specific Mastercard or Visa conduct or damages. The Mastercard portion (or any Mastercard-related liability not subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will then be apportioned under the Mastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement among Mastercard and PNC and the other financial institution defendants that are parties to this agreement. The responsibility for the Visa portion (or any Visa-related liability not subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will be apportioned under the pre-existing indemnification responsibilities and judgment and loss sharing agreements.\nUSAA Patent Infringement Litigation\nIn September 2020, USAA filed a lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A. \n(Case No. 2:20-cv-319)) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against PNC Bank for patent infringement (the \n“\nfirst Texas case”). USAA amended its complaint in December 2020. As amended, the complaint alleges that PNC\n’\ns mobile remote deposit capture systems infringe four patents owned by USAA. USAA seeks, among other things, a judgment that PNC is infringing each of the patents, damages for willful infringement, and attorneys’ fees. PNC, in its answer, alleged that USAA infringed four of PNC\n’\ns patents and that PNC seeks, among other things, a judgment that USAA is infringing each of the patents, damages for willful infringement, and attorneys’ fees. In March 2022, the court severed PNC\n’\ns infringement allegations from the first Texas case and in June 2022 opened a new case (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A.\n (Case No. 2:22-cv-193) (the “fourth Texas case”)).\nIn December 2020, we filed a lawsuit (\nPNC Bank, NA v. United Services Automobile Association \n(Case No. 2:20-cv-1886)) in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against USAA seeking declaratory judgment of non-infringement as to two of the patents at issue in the first Texas case and awarding PNC its fees and costs. In June 2021, the court stayed and administratively closed this case pending the court in the first Texas case ruling that the case should be transferred to the Western District of Pennsylvania. In September 2021, the court in the first Texas case denied PNC\n’\ns motion to transfer the case to the Western District of Pennsylvania.\nIn March 2021, USAA filed a second lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A\n. (Case No. 2:21-cv-110)) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against PNC Bank for patent infringement (the “second Texas case”). The complaint alleges that PNC’s mobile remote deposit capture systems infringe an additional two patents owned by USAA. USAA seeks, among other things, a judgment that PNC is infringing each of the patents, damages for willful infringement, and attorneys’ fees. The first Texas case and the second Texas case were consolidated (together, the “first consolidated cases”). At trial, in May 2022, only four of the original six USAA patents raised in its complaints were asserted against PNC, including U.S. Patent No. 8,977,571 (‘571). Following the jury trial in the first consolidated cases, the jury found against PNC for willful infringement of at least one of USAA’s asserted patent claims and awarded approximately $\n218\n million. Subsequently, PNC filed post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial, all of which the court denied. In April 2023, PNC noticed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A.\n (Case No. 23-1778)) regarding the final judgment entered against PNC. Briefing for Case No. 23-1778 is complete, oral argument occurred on November 6, 2024, and the appeal has been submitted for decision. As discussed below, on February 3, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's invalidity finding regarding the claims of the ‘571 patent.\n178\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\nIn July 2021, USAA filed a third lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC\n \nBank N.A.\n (Case No. 2:21-cv-246)) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against PNC Bank for patent infringement (the “third Texas case”). The complaint alleges that PNC’s mobile remote deposit capture systems, including its new versions, infringe three additional patents owned by USAA. USAA seeks, among other things, a judgment that PNC is infringing each of the patents, damages for willful infringement, and attorneys’ fees. In June 2022, the court consolidated the fourth Texas case into the third Texas case (together, “the second consolidated cases”). At trial in September 2022, only two of the original three USAA patents were asserted against PNC, including U.S. Patent No. 10,769,598 (‘598), and only two of the original four PNC patents were asserted against USAA. Following the jury trial in the second consolidated cases, the jury found against PNC for infringement of at least one of the two asserted patents and awarded $\n4.3\n million, and determined that PNC did not willfully infringe the patents. The jury further found that USAA did not infringe any of PNC’s asserted patents. Subsequently, USAA filed a motion for a new trial on damages, and, in April 2023, the court denied USAA’s motion. In March 2023, PNC noticed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit regarding the final judgment entered against PNC and in April 2023, USAA noticed a cross-appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit regarding the final judgment. These appeals were consolidated as \nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A.\n (Case No. 23-1639). Briefing for Case No. 23-1639 is complete, oral argument occurred on November 6, 2024, and the appeal has been submitted for decision.\nIn August 2021, USAA filed a lawsuit (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. BBVA USA\n (Case No. 2:21-cv-311)) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against BBVA USA for patent infringement (the “BBVA USA Texas case”). The complaint alleges that BBVA USA’s mobile remote deposit capture systems infringe the same six USAA patents at issue in the first consolidated cases. USAA seeks, among other things, a judgment that BBVA USA is infringing each of the patents, damages for willful infringement, and attorneys’ fees. In October 2021, BBVA USA was merged into PNC Bank. In June 2022, the court entered a stipulation proposed by the parties, stayed all deadlines, and administratively closed the matter. \nIn January 2022, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board granted institution of inter partes review (“IPR”) with respect to petitions filed by PNC for three of the six patents then at issue in the first consolidated cases and in the BBVA USA Texas case. Because of USAA’s case narrowing in the first consolidated cases, only one of the three patents being reviewed (U.S. Patent No. ‘571) was presented to the jury in the first consolidated cases. In January 2023, with respect to the three patents in which an IPR was instituted, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board entered its Final Written Decisions and found all of the challenged claims were unpatentable. With respect to U.S. Patent No. ‘571, in June 2023, USAA noticed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit challenging the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s Final Written Decision, which became \nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A. \n(Case No. 23-2125). USAA, in May and June 2023, also appealed the Final Written Decisions invalidating the claims of the patents not presented to the jury which became \nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A.\n (Case No. 23-2124) and \nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A.\n (Case No. 23-1920). Two of these appeals (Case Nos. 23-2124 and 23-2125) were consolidated. With respect to Case No. 23-1920, on January 30, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s invalidity finding. For Case Nos. 23-2124 and 23-2125, on February 3, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Patent Trial and Appeal Board invalidity findings.\nIn May and June 2022, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board granted institution of IPR with respect to petitions filed by PNC for two of the three patents then at issue in the third Texas case. Because of USAA’s case narrowing in the third Texas case, only one of these two patents being reviewed (U.S. Patent No. ‘598) was presented to the jury in the third Texas case. With respect to U.S. Patent No. ‘598, in May 2023, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board entered its Final Written Decision holding most of the claims of this patent unpatentable and other claims were patentable. Both parties, in July 2023, appealed the Final Written Decision, with USAA appealing first (\nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A.\n (Case No. 23-2171) and PNC being the cross-appellant (\nPNC Bank N.A. v. United Services Automobile Association\n (Case No. 23-2172)). These appeals were consolidated. With respect to the other patent (which was not presented to the jury), the Patent Trial and Appeal Board entered its Final Written Decision in June 2023 and held all of the claims unpatentable. USAA, in August 2023, appealed from this decision which became \nUnited Services Automobile Association v. PNC Bank N.A. \n(Case No. 23-2244). With respect to Case Nos. 23-2171 and 23-2172, on January 30, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s invalidity finding and reversed its validity finding, which resulted in each of the challenged claims being invalidated. For Case No. 23-2244, the briefing is complete, oral argument occurred on January 8, 2025, and the appeal has been submitted for decision.\nRegulatory and Governmental Inquiries\nWe are the subject of investigations, audits, examinations and other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry covering a broad range of issues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage, securities and other financial services businesses, as well as other aspects of our operations. In some cases, these inquiries are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants; in others, they are directed at PNC individually. From time to time, these inquiries have involved and may in the future involve or lead to regulatory enforcement actions and other administrative proceedings. These inquiries have also led to and may in the future lead to civil or criminal judicial proceedings. Some of these inquiries result in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs and other consequences. Such remedies and other consequences typically have not been material to us from a financial standpoint, but could be in the future. Even if not financially material, they may \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n179\nresult in significant reputational harm or other adverse consequences. Our practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries.\nOther\nIn addition to the proceedings or other matters described above, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the proceedings or other matters described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period, which will depend on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the claim and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.\nN\nOTE\n 21 \nP\nARENT\n C\nOMPANY\nSummarized financial information of the parent company is as follows:\nTable 116: Parent Company -

Our reportable business segments are defined by the nature of products and services, types of customers, methods used to distribute products or provide services and similar financial performance. Results of our reportable business segments are regularly reviewed by the CODM, our Chief Executive Officer. Specifically, the CODM utilizes quarterly financial reporting results, including net income, to assess performance and allocate resources accordingly. However, the CODM may use other metrics on an ad hoc basis as warranted.\nThe following describes the products and services of each business segment: \nRetail Banking\n provides deposit, lending, brokerage, insurance services, investment management and cash management products and services to consumer and small business customers who are serviced through our coast-to-coast branch network, digital channels, ATMs, or through our phone-based customer contact centers. Deposit products include checking, savings and money market accounts and time deposits. Lending products include residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, credit cards, education loans and personal and small business loans and lines of credit. The residential mortgage loans are directly originated within our branch network and nationwide, and are typically underwritten to agency and/or third-party standards, and either sold, servicing retained or held on our balance sheet. Brokerage, investment management and cash management products and services include managed, education, retirement and trust accounts.\nCorporate & Institutional Banking \nprovides lending, treasury management, capital markets and advisory products and services to mid-sized and large corporations and government and not-for-profit entities. Lending products include secured and unsecured loans, letters of credit and equipment leases. The Treasury Management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and disbursement management services, funds transfer services and access to online/mobile information management and reporting services. Capital markets and advisory includes services and activities primarily related to merger and acquisitions advisory, equity capital markets advisory, asset-backed financing, loan syndication, securities underwriting \n182\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\nand customer-related trading. We also provide commercial loan servicing and technology solutions for the commercial real estate finance industry. Products and services are provided nationally. \nAsset Management Group\n \nprovides private banking for high net worth and ultra high net worth clients and institutional asset management. The Asset Management group is composed of \ntwo\n operating units: \n•\nPNC Private Bank provides products and services to emerging affluent, high net worth and ultra high net worth individuals and their families, including investment and retirement planning, customized investment management, credit and cash management solutions, trust management and administration. In addition, multi-generational family planning services are also provided to ultra high net worth individuals and their families, which include estate, financial, tax, fiduciary and customized performance reporting through PNC Private Bank Hawthorn. \n•\nInstitutional Asset Management provides outsourced chief investment officer, custody, cash and fixed income client solutions and retirement plan fiduciary investment services to institutional clients including corporations, healthcare systems, insurance companies, unions, municipalities and non-profits.\nBasis of Presentation\nResults of individual businesses are presented based on our internal management reporting practices. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the extent significant and practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability with the current period.\nFunds Transfer Pricing\nNet interest income in business segment results reflects our internal FTP methodology, which is designed to consider interest rate and liquidity risks. Under our methodology, assets receive a funding charge while liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on market interest rates, product characteristics and other factors.\nOur FTP framework considers the application of funding curves and methodologies consistently across the balance sheet. A residual gain or loss from FTP operations is not allocated to our reportable business segments. This residual gain or loss is reviewed by management quarterly, in accordance with the interagency guidance of the FDIC, Federal Reserve and OCC. \nSegment Allocations \nFinancial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a standalone basis, and includes expense allocations for corporate overhead services used by the business segments.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our reportable business segments because they (i) are transitory or highly irregular in nature, (ii) exist solely to support corporate activities unrelated to business segment operations, or (iii) reflect residual costs for an exited business.\nWe have allocated the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments based on the loan exposures within each business segment’s portfolio. \nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n183\nResults of our reportable business segments for 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nTable 120: Business Segment Results \nRetail Banking \nCorporate & Institutional Banking\nAsset Management Group\nYear ended December 31\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet interest income \n$\n10,933\n \n$\n9,974\n \n$\n7,540\n \n$\n6,302\n \n$\n5,732\n \n$\n5,179\n \n$\n652\n \n$\n547\n \n$\n608\n \nNoninterest income\n3,582\n \n2,951\n \n2,967\n \n3,927\n \n3,537\n \n3,621\n \n949\n \n905\n \n936\n \nTotal revenue\n14,515\n \n12,925\n \n10,507\n \n10,229\n \n9,269\n \n8,800\n \n1,601\n \n1,452\n \n1,544\n \nProvision for (recapture of) credit losses\n$\n362\n \n$\n396\n \n$\n259\n \n$\n453\n \n$\n398\n \n$\n198\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n28\n \nNoninterest expense\nPersonnel\n$\n2,189\n \n$\n2,266\n \n$\n2,409\n \n$\n1,508\n \n$\n1,426\n \n$\n1,463\n \n$\n472\n \n$\n494\n \n$\n483\n \nSegment allocations (a)\n3,653\n \n3,571\n \n3,394\n \n1,497\n \n1,507\n \n1,421\n \n454\n \n464\n \n441\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n312\n \n330\n \n310\n \n202\n \n211\n \n213\n \n30\n \n30\n \n29\n \nOther (b)\n1,377\n \n1,388\n \n1,485\n \n557\n \n586\n \n554\n \n117\n \n127\n \n133\n \nTotal noninterest expense\n7,531\n \n$\n7,555\n \n$\n7,598\n \n$\n3,764\n \n$\n3,730\n \n$\n3,651\n \n$\n1,073\n \n$\n1,115\n \n$\n1,086\n \nIncome before income taxes and noncontrolling interests\n6,622\n \n4,974\n \n2,650\n \n6,012\n \n5,141\n \n4,951\n \n531\n \n340\n \n430\n \nIncome taxes \n1,545\n \n1,163\n \n621\n \n1,264\n \n1,073\n \n1,064\n \n124\n \n$\n80\n \n$\n100\n \nNet income \n5,077\n \n3,811\n \n2,029\n \n4,748\n \n4,068\n \n3,887\n \n407\n \n260\n \n330\n \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n39\n43\n55\n19\n19\n17\nNet income excluding noncontrolling interests\n$\n5,038\n \n$\n3,768\n \n$\n1,974\n \n$\n4,729\n \n$\n4,049\n \n$\n3,870\n \n$\n407\n \n$\n260\n \n$\n330\n \nAverage assets\n$\n114,631\n \n$\n114,914\n \n$\n113,829\n \n$\n228,349\n \n$\n233,337\n \n$\n219,941\n \n$\n16,872\n \n$\n15,812\n \n$\n14,505\n \n(a)\nRepresents expense allocations for corporate overhead services used by each business segment; primarily comprised of technology, human resources and occupancy-related allocations.\n(b)\nOther is primarily comprised of other direct expenses including outside services and equipment expense.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of financial results for the \nthree\n reportable business segments to our consolidated reporting. \nTable 121:  Reconciliation of Business Segment Results to Consolidated\nYear ended December 31\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues \nTotal business segment revenue\n$\n26,345\n \n$\n23,646\n \n$\n20,851\n \nRevenues from other activities \n(\n4,790\n)\n(\n2,156\n)\n269\n \nTotal revenue\n$\n21,555\n \n$\n21,490\n \n$\n21,120\n \nNoninterest Expense\nTotal business segment noninterest expense\n$\n12,368\n \n$\n12,400\n \n$\n12,335\n \nFDIC special assessment \n112\n \n515\n \nWorkforce reduction charges\n \n150\n \nPNC Foundation contribution \n120\n \n50\n \nNoninterest expense from other activities \n924\n \n897\n \n835\n \nTotal noninterest expense\n$\n13,524\n \n$\n14,012\n \n$\n13,170\n \nNet Income\nTotal business segment net income\n$\n10,232\n \n$\n8,139\n \n$\n6,246\n \nFDIC special assessment \n(\n112\n)\n(\n515\n)\nWorkforce reduction charges \n(\n150\n)\nPNC Foundation contribution \n(\n120\n)\n(\n50\n)\nNet income (loss) from other activities\n(\n4,047\n)\n(\n1,777\n)\n(\n133\n)\nNet income\n$\n5,953\n \n$\n5,647\n \n$\n6,113\n \nAverage Assets\nTotal business segment average assets \n$\n359,852\n \n$\n364,063\n \n$\n348,275\n \nAverage assets from other activities\n205,031\n \n194,707\n \n202,377\n \nTotal average assets \n$\n564,883\n \n$\n558,770\n \n$\n550,652\n \n184\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\nOther activities reflect the remaining corporate operations that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business.

The objective of the standard is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers across all industries and to develop a common revenue standard under GAAP. The standard requires the application of a five-step recognition model to contracts, allocating the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to across distinct promises in the contract, called performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when or as those services are transferred to the customer.\nFee-based revenue within the scope of Topic 606 is recognized within our \nthree\n reportable business segments: Retail Banking, Corporate & Institutional Banking and Asset Management Group. Interest income, income from lease contracts, fair value gains from financial instruments (including derivatives), income from mortgage servicing rights and guarantee products, letter of credit fees, non-refundable fees associated with acquiring or originating a loan and gains from the sale of financial assets are outside of the scope of Topic 606.\nTable 122 presents the noninterest income recognized within the scope of Topic 606 for each of our \nthree\n reportable business segments’ principal products and services, along with the relationship to the noninterest income revenue streams shown on our Consolidated Income Statement. A description of the fee-based revenue and how it is recognized for each segment’s principal products and services follows this Table 122. \nTable 122: Noninterest Income by Business Segment and

In order to promote a robust risk culture, the Board and executive management establish code of conduct and professional standards to which all employees must adhere. A strong risk culture discourages misconduct and supports conduct risk management at PNC. Conduct risk is defined as the risk that employees fail to comply with the ethical standards expected of them. Strong conduct risk management is important in supporting PNC’s reputation, and PNC maintains a corporate culture that emphasizes complying with laws, regulations, and managing reputational risks. Reputational risk is the risk to the franchise and/or shareholder value based on a negative perception of PNC by its stakeholders and/or the changing expectations of its stakeholders. As part of assessing those risks, transactions and potential customers may be subjected to an industry-agnostic reputation risk assessment designed to help us better identify and mitigate environmental, human rights and other reputational risks early in the on-boarding process. Transactions and potential customers identified as having these risks are evaluated to determine whether additional due diligence is warranted. Strategic risk is another component of the ERM Framework that is also critical to optimizing shareholder returns. Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, or liquidity that may arise from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions and/or inadequate response to changes in the business environment. Strategic risk is considered and assessed by our businesses in the annual strategic planning processes and monitored on an on-going basis as those plans are carried out.\n80\n    The PNC Financial

Note 1 Accounting Policies describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments and estimated recoveries. Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and transaction characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these factors and to estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and other methods used to estimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. The major drivers of ACL estimates include, but are not limited to:\n•\nCurrent economic conditions: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date. As current economic conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected.\n•\nScenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic forecasts and thus vary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. Changes to the probability weights assigned to these scenarios and the timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates.\n•\nCurrent borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on current borrower and transaction characteristics, including credit metrics and collateral type/quality. As borrower quality evolves, forecasted losses could be materially affected.\n•\nPortfolio composition: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves\nwould be recognized upon origination or acquisition and derecognized upon paydown, maturity or sale.\nWe also incorporate qualitative factors in the ACL that reflect our best estimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions, as discussed below and in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of Note 1 Accounting Policies.\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of one or a combination of the following components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves, and\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n83\n \n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies.\nReasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast\nPursuant to the CECL standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses. For this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. Credit losses estimated in our reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to them.\nTo forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we generate four economic forecast scenarios using a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking expert judgment. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) to represent our current expectation within that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution and the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected economic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans, securities and other financial assets. Each quarter, the scenarios and their respective weights are presented to RAC for approval.\nThe scenarios used for the period ended December 31, 2024 consider, among other factors, the ongoing inflationary pressures and the corresponding tightness of monetary policy and credit availability. Given these factors, growth is expected to slow from current levels in the coming quarters. While recession risks remain elevated, our most likely expectation at December 31, 2024 is that the U.S. economy avoids a recession.\nWe used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real GDP and the U.S. unemployment rate. The following table presents a comparison of these two economic variables based on the weighted-average scenario forecasts used in determining our ACL at December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nTable 42: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL Weighted-Average Scenarios\nAssumptions as of December 31, 2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\nU.S. real GDP (a) \n0.7%\n2.2%\n2.2%\nU.S. Unemployment Rate (b)\n4.8%\n4.7%\n4.4%\nAssumptions as of December 31, 2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\nU.S. real GDP (a) \n0.1%\n1.5%\n2.0%\nU.S. Unemployment Rate (c)\n4.5%\n4.6%\n4.2%\n(a)\nRepresents year-over-year growth rates.\n(b)\nRepresents quarterly average rate at December 31, 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively.\n(c)\nRepresents quarterly average rate at December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nReal GDP growth is expected to slow by the end of 2025 to 0.7% on a weighted average basis, down from the 1.5% assumed at December 31, 2023. Growth then rebounds to 2.2% where real GDP remains stable through 2026 and 2027. The weighted-average unemployment rate is expected to end 2025 at 4.8%, peaking at 4.9% in 2026 before decreasing to 4.4% by the fourth quarter of 2027. \nTo provide additional context regarding the sensitivity of the ACL to a more pessimistic forecast of expected economic outcomes, we considered what our ACL would be when applying a 100% probability weighting to the most severe downside CECL scenario. This severe downside scenario estimated that real GDP contracted in 2025 ending the year down 2.5% compared to 2024 levels, with growth picking up again by the end of 2026. The unemployment rate in this scenario increased to end 2025 at 6.6%, then peaks at 7.1% in 2026, before gradually improving to 6.1% by the end of 2027. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2024. This scenario does not reflect our current expectation at December 31, 2024, nor does it capture all the potential unknown variables that could arise in the forecast period, but it provides an approximation of a possible outcome under hypothetical severe conditions. The CECL methodology inherently requires a high degree of judgment, and as a result, it is possible that we may, at another point in time, reach different conclusions regarding our credit loss estimates.\nQualitative Component \nAs discussed in the Allowance for Credit Losses section of Note 1 Accounting Policies, we incorporate qualitative reserves in the ACL that reflect our best estimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, inherent forecasting limitations, model imprecision, timing of available information, and/or emerging and ongoing credit risks. At December 31, 2024, the qualitative framework considers PNC’s \n84\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nview of the current state of the economy, which continues to reflect uncertainty due to the fundamental change in office demand from the acceptance of remote work, inflationary pressures, interest rate movements and housing affordability. Our most significant qualitative factor was related to the office portfolio of the commercial real estate loan class.\nWe believe the economic scenarios effectively reflect the distribution of potential economic outcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and granular analysis we have addressed reserve requirements for the specific populations most affected in the current environment. Through this approach, we believe the reserve levels appropriately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date. \nSee the following for additional details on the components of our ACL:\n•\nAllowance for Credit Losses in the Credit Risk Management section of this Item 7, and\n•\nNote 1 Accounting Policies, Note 2 Investment Securities, and Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.\n \nResidential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\nWe elect to measure our MSRs at fair value. This election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets. The fair value of our MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors which are determined based on current market conditions.\nWe employ risk management strategies designed to protect the value of MSRs from changes in interest rates and related market factors. The values of the MSRs are economically hedged with securities and derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, options, and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts. As interest rates change, these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value inverse to the change in fair value of the hedged MSR portfolios. The hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the MSRs. Selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial MSRs requires significant management judgment to assess how rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of MSRs. Hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term, but over longer periods of time, they are expected to protect the economic value of the MSRs.\nFor information on how each estimate has changed and a sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect of the fair value of MSRs to immediate adverse changes in key assumptions, see Note 5 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights. For additional information on our residential and commercial MSRs, see Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 5 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights and Note 14 Fair Value.\nFair Value Measurements - Level 3\nWe must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. When observable price and third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these valuation techniques could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nWe apply ASC 820 – \nFair Value Measurements\n. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This guidance requires a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable. Level 3 assets and liabilities are those where the fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs. An asset or liability’s classification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts and circumstances associated with each instrument, and management applies judgment regarding the significance of unobservable inputs to each asset or liability when determining its fair value level classification. In addition to MSRs, certain of our private equity investments and available-for-sale securities have a high level of estimation uncertainty and require significant management judgment to determine the fair value. While estimating potential sensitivities around fair value measurements is inherently challenging, we provide a summary of the key unobservable inputs as well as additional information on Level 3 fair value measurements in Note 14 Fair Value.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n85\n \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nAccounting Standards Update\nDescription\nFinancial Statement Impact\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures - ASU 2023-09\nIssued December 2023\n• Required with issuance of 2025 Form 10-K; early adoption is permitted.\n• Requires public business entities to, on an annual basis, (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold.\n• Requires that all entities disclose, on an annual basis, (1) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by federal (national), state and foreign taxes, and (2) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received).\n• Allows for either a prospective or retrospective transition approach.\n• We are currently evaluating the disclosure requirements of this ASU and do not plan to early adopt.\n• This ASU will not impact our Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n• We expect to provide additional disaggregated income tax disclosures in accordance with this ASU. \nAccounting Standards Update\nDescription\nFinancial Statement Impact\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses - ASU 2024-03\nIssued November 2024\n• Required with issuance of 2027 Form 10-K; early adoption is permitted.\n• Requires public business entities to disclose, in the notes to financial statements and on an annual and interim basis, specified information about certain costs and expenses (including, if relevant: inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation from oil and gas-producing activities).\n• Requires qualitative descriptions of amounts not separately disaggregated to be disclosed.\n• Requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses.\n• Allows for either a prospective or retrospective transition approach.\n• We are currently evaluating the disclosure requirements within this ASU and do not plan to early adopt.\n• This ASU will not impact our Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n• We expect to provide additional disaggregated income statement expense disclosures in accordance with this ASU.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements that we have adopted.\n86\n    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – \n2024 Form 10-K\n \nC\nAUTIONARY\n S\nTATEMENT\n R\nEGARDING\n F\nORWARD\n-L\nOOKING\n I\nNFORMATION\nWe make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for financial performance, such as earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations, including our sustainability strategy, that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions. \nForward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Future events or circumstances may change our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which our forward-looking statements are subject. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance. As a result, we caution against placing undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.\n•\nOur businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including:\n–\nChanges in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets,\n–\nDisruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets,\n–\nActions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply, market interest rates and inflation,\n–\nChanges in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives,\n–\nChanges in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness,\n–\nImpacts of sanctions, tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,\n–\nImpacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs,\n–\nOur ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees, and\n–\nCommodity price volatility.\n•\nOur forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on our views that:\n–\nThe labor market remains strong, and job and income gains will continue to support consumer spending growth in the near term. PNC’s baseline forecast is for continued expansion, but slower economic growth in 2025 than in 2024. High interest rates remain a drag on the economy, consumer spending growth will slow to a pace more consistent with household income growth, and government’s contribution to economic growth will be smaller.\n–\nReal GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 will be approximately 2%, and the unemployment rate will remain somewhat above 4% throughout 2025 and into 2026. There will be little progress on inflation in 2025; wage pressures will abate, but higher tariffs will offset this, and inflation will remain above the Federal Reserve’s 2% objective throughout 2025.\n–\nLittle progress on inflation this year will limit monetary easing. PNC expects two additional federal funds rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2025, one in May and one in July. The federal funds rate will be in a range between 3.75% and 4.00% in the second half of 2025, and remain in that range into 2026.\n•\nPNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. \n•\nPNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, its financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory review of related models and the reliability of and risks resulting from extensive use of such models.\n•\nLegal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding and ability to attract and retain employees. These developments could include:\n–\nChanges to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations, and changes in accounting and reporting standards.\n–\nUnfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries resulting in monetary losses, costs, or alterations in our business practices, and potentially causing reputational harm to PNC.\n–\nResults of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  \n2024 Form 10-K\n  \n87\n \n–\nCosts associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.\n•\nBusiness and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n•\nOur reputation and business and operating results may be affected by our ability to appropriately meet or address environmental, social or governance targets, goals, commitments or concerns that may arise.\n•\nW\ne grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing or any failure to execute strategic or operational plans.\n•\nCompetition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.\n•\nBusiness and operating results can also be affected by widespread manmade, natural and other disasters (including severe weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities or events, terrorist activities, system failures or disruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks, international hostilities, or other extraordinary events beyond PNC’s control through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties, customers or third-party vendors and service providers specifically. \nWe provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in this Report, including in"
