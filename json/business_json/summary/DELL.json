During Fiscal 2025, we paid an immaterial amount of dividend equivalents on eligible vested equity awards which are not included above .\n The following graph compares the cumulative total return on the Company’s Class C Common Stock for the period from January  2020 through January 31, 2020 with the total return over the same period on the S&P 500 Index . The graph assumes that $100 was invested on January 31, 2020 in the Class . Stock performance graph assumes reinvestment of dividends, if any .\n This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 items . This section also discusses Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 results . The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs, and that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties . Unless otherwise indicated, all results presented are prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America .\n References in this report mean Dell Technologies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries . References to “Dell” mean Dell and “EMC” means EMC Corporation and EMC Corp.’s consolidated subsidiaries, and references to ‘emC’ mean EMC . Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday nearest January 31 .\n Infrastructure Solutions Group (“ISG) includes our servers and networking offerings and our storage offerings . ISG also offers software, peripherals, and services, including consulting and support and deployment . CSG also includes branded PCs, including notebooks, desktops, and workstations, branded peripherals and third-party software and peripherals .\n The transaction was completed on February 3, 2025, subsequent to the close of the Company’s fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 . Dell Financial Services and its affiliates support financing solutions and services as part of the portfolio . The demand environment was strong for our servers and networking offerings, which contributed to overall net revenue growth .\n We expect modest CSG net revenue growth for the full fiscal year, driven in part by the anticipated PC refresh cycle in the latter part of Fiscal 2026 . On November 22, 2023, Broadcom Inc. (“Broadcom”) completed its acquisition of VMware, leading to changes to our relationship with VMware as described below .\n We look to balance profitability and growth while maintaining disciplined pricing as we navigate through competitive pricing pressures . We no longer act as a distributor of Broadcom’s VMware standalone products and services, although we will continue to support customers that have purchased resale offerings sold in prior periods . We believe our unique operating advantages provide a foundation to foster growth, drive efficiencies, and continue to position us for long-term success .\n The results of such offerings are reflected within CSG or ISG depending upon the nature of the underlying offering sold . We expect ISG will continue to be impacted by the evolving nature of IT infrastructure market and competitive environment . The timing of customer purchases reflects the varying stages of adoption of AI by different customer segments and drives variability in our revenue .\n ISG participate in all segments of the PC market with a focus on commercial and high-end consumer computing devices . We expect that CSG will benefit from advances in AI over the long-term as customers will require PCs with the ability to run their complex AI workloads . Our storage business is subject to seasonal trends, which may continue to impact ISG results .\n As part of our strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic investments through our venture capital investment arm, Dell Technologies Capital . Half of our net revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 . We may also make targeted acquisitions of businesses that advance our strategic objectives and accelerate our innovation agenda .\n In this management’s discussion and analysis, we use supplemental measures of our performance which are derived from our consolidated financial information . These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance or liquidity in isolation from or as a substitute for gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, or adjusted free cash flow .\n Non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, other corporate expenses, fair value adjustments on equity investments and an aggregate adjustment for income taxes . Dell Technologies Inc. - diluted, as defined by us, exclude   exclude  amortization of intangible assessments and  adjustments on equity investments . Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAap financial measures differently .\n The exclusion of these items should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual . ll as our reasons for excluding them from our non-GAAP results . In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items . We exclude amortization charges as they do not reflect our current operating performance and charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions .\n Other corporate expenses consist primarily of severance expenses, payroll taxes associated with stock-based compensation, incentive charges related to equity investments, facility action costs, transaction-related expenses, and impairment charges . Severance costs are primarily related to severance and benefits for employees terminated pursuant to cost management initiatives . We exclude other corporate expenses as they can vary from period to period, are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events .\n The aggregate adjustment for income taxes is the estimated combined income tax effect for the adjustments described above and determined based on the tax jurisdictions where those adjustments were incurred . We exclude fair value adjustments on equity investments given the volatility in ongoing adjustments to the valuation of these strategic investments and because such adjustments are unrelated to the operating performance of our business .\n Beginning in Fiscal 2025, our non-GAAP income tax was calculated using a fixed estimated annual tax rate that is determined based on historical trends and projections for the current fiscal year . We may adjust our estimated tax rate during the fiscal year to take into account events that would significantly impact our income tax expense, including significant changes resulting from tax legislation, changes in geographic mix of revenue and expenses, changes to our corporate structure .\n Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are non-GAAP liquidity measures to evaluate our performance . Dell Technologies Inc. — diluted (in millions, except percentages and per share amounts) – $7.61 (3) per share) - $14,790 proportionately (7) $13,281 per share (4) $7,766 per-share (7)\n Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not purport to be alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity . These measures reflect cash that we can use, among other purposes, to repurchase common stock, pay dividends, invest in our business, pay down debt, and make strategic acquisitions .\n The following table summarizes our consolidated results for the periods indicated . Unless otherwise indicated, all changes identified for the current-period results represent comparisons to results from the prior corresponding fiscal period . Free cash flow includes proceeds from sales of facilities, land, and other assets . Cash flow from operations from operations $4,521 (48) and $3,565  (2,563) Capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs, net .\n Dell Technologies — diluted: $1,958 (3,67) free cash flow$3,097 45,266 (45) Free cash flow from operations: $4,521  (48) Net income (4,576) $3,576 (4.8) Net Income (5,771) $2,565 (3,565) Non-GAAP Financial Information: $11,766 (4)\n During Fiscal 2025, operating income and non-GAAP operating income increased by 15% to $6.2 billion to $8.5 billion . The increase in ISG net revenue was driven by growth in our servers and networking offerings . Corporate and other net revenue declined primarily due to a decrease in our CSG revenue as we no longer act as a standalone .\n Cash provided by operating activities was $4.5 billion during Fiscal 2025, and was driven by profitability, partially offset by working capital dynamics . Working capital was primarily impacted by AI, which led to higher inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable levels . The favorable impact of a decrease in operating expense rate was offset by a decline in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue .\n During Fiscal 2025, net revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by an increase in ISG net revenue . Product net revenue includes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software licenses . Services net revenue was flat as the growth within CSG services net revenue and, to a lesser extent, ISG services and CSG service net revenue were offset by a decline in Corporate and other service offerings .\n A substantial portion of services net revenue is derived from offerings that have been deferred over a period of time . Net revenue increased during Fiscal 2025 in the Americas and, to a lesser extent, APJ and remained flat in EMEA . During Fiscal 2024, net revenue decreased 14% due to declines in CSG net revenue and ISG product net revenue .\n Net revenue decreased in the Americas, EMEA, and APJ during Fiscal 2024, most notably within APJ . Gross margin and non-GAAP gross margin percentage decreased 160 basis points to 22.2% and 170 basis points . The decrease in CSG product gross margin was primarily attributable to a competitive pricing environment .\n Both gross margin and non-GAAP gross margin percentage increased 160 basis points, to 23.8% and 24.5%, respectively, during Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023 . Product gross margin decreased 7% to $21.1 billion and 8% to $21.6 billion, respectively . The declines were primarily attributable to a shift in mix towards our AI-optimized server offerings .\n Product gross margin and non-GAAP product gross margin both decreased 15% in Fiscal 2024 . Services gross margin increased 4% and 3% to $9.8 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively . CSG gross margin percentage increased 80 basis points, to 17.5% and 18.1% .\n The terms and conditions of our vendor rebate programs are largely based on product volumes and are generally negotiated either at the beginning of the annual or quarterly period . The timing and amount of vendor rebates and other discounts we receive under the programs may vary from period to period, reflecting changes in the competitive environment . We manage our costs on a total net cost basis, which includes supplier list prices reduced by rebates . Our gross margins for Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were not materially affected .\n During Fiscal 2025, total operating expenses decreased 4%, due to a decline in selling, general, and administrative expenses . R&D expenses increased 9% during Fiscal 2025 . We continue to make strategic investments designed to enable growth and innovation, while balancing our efforts to drive cost efficiencies in the business . We also expect to continue making investments in support of our own digital transformation, which aims to streamline and optimize  digital transformation .\n During Fiscal 2024, total operating expenses decreased 7% due to a decline in SG&A expenses . During Fiscal 2025, operating income and non-GAAP operating income increased by 15% to $6.2 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively . ISG's servers and networking offerings and, to a lesser extent, our storage offerin contributed to the increase in ISG operating income .\n During Fiscal 2025, operating income and non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenue increased 40 basis points to 6.5% and remained flat at 8.9% . ISG operating income decreased by 6% and 9% to $7.9 billion, respectively, during Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023 .\n The change in interest and other, net was favorable primarily as a result of $0.9 billion of expense recognized in Fiscal 2023 in connection with an agreement to settle the Class V transaction litigation, coupled with a gain on investments and an increase in investment income during Fiscal 2024 . The increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase  associated with DFS securitization and structured financing programs .\n The differences between our effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% principally result from the geographical distribution of income, differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items, and discrete tax items . In certain jurisdictions, our tax rate is significantly less than the applicable statutory rate as a result of tax holidays .\n Many countries, including Singapore, have enacted or are in the process of enacting laws based on the Pillar Two proposal relating to a global minimum tax issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) As of January 31, 2025, we were not aware of any matters of non-compliance . Our income tax benefits attributable to tax holidays and incentives of the affected subsidiaries were immaterial to our provision for income taxes and earnings per share .\n The reportable segments are based on the ISG and CSG business units . A description of our business units is provided under “Introduction.” See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a reconciliation of net revenue and operating income by reportable segment to consolidated net revenue .\n ISG net revenue increased 29%, driven primarily by strength in our servers and networking offerings . ISG operating income as a percentage of net revenue decreased 20 basis points to 12.8% during Fiscal 2025 . Gross margin rate decreased primarily as a result of a shift in mix towards AI-optimized server offerings .\n During Fiscal 2024, storage net revenue decreased 9%, driven by a decline in net revenue across the majority of our storage offerings . ISG operating income as a percentage of net revenue increased 60 basis points to 12.6% during Fiscal 2024 . CSG net revenue attributable to ISG decreased in the Americas, EMEA, and APJ .\n During Fiscal 2025, CSG operating income as a percentage of net revenue decreased 150 basis points to 6.1% . Commercial net revenue increased 3% during Fiscal 2025 primarily due to an increase in units sold . From a geographical perspective, net revenue attributable to CSG decreased in APJ and the Americas and increased in EMEA .\n During Fiscal 2024, CSG operating income as a percentage of net revenue increased 100 basis points to 7.6% . Operating expenses increased as a result of a decline in CSG net revenue that outpaced the impact of continued cost management measures . Accounts receivable, net was up due to growth in our AI-optimized server offerings and the timing of cash receipts .\n DFS originates, collects, and services customer receivables primarily related to the purchase of our product and services solutions . New financing originations were $8.4 billion for both Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 and $9.7 billion for Fiscal 2023 . The principal charge-off rate for our financing receivable portfolio was 0.6% for Fiscal 2025 .\n We have an extensive process to manage our exposure to customer credit risk that includes active management of credit lines and collection activities . We also sell selected fixed-term financing receivables without recourse to unrelated third parties on a periodic basis . We retain a residual interest in equipment leased under our lease programs . No expected losses were recorded related to residual assets during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 .\n Offerings are initially funded through cash on hand at the time of origination, most of which is subsequently replaced with asset-backed financing . For offerings that qualify as sales-type leases, the initial funding of financing receivables is reflected as an impact to cash flows from operations . No material impairment losses were recorded related to such equipment during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 .\n Current cash and cash equivalents, together with cash that will be provided by future operations and borrowings and issuances expected to be available under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, will be sufficient over the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter to meet our material cash requirements . As of January 31, 2025, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility and remaining remaining  remaining  borrowings .\n We maintain a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured notes in a maximum aggregate face amount of $5.0 billion outstanding at any time, with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue . As of January 31, 2025, we had no outstanding issuances under the program . The outstanding principal amount of our debt decreased $1.4 billion to $24.8 billion .\n DFS related debt primarily represents debt from our securitization and structured financing programs . The risk of loss under these programs is limited to transferred lease and loan payments and associated equipment, as the credit holders have no recourse to Dell Technologies . The debt-to-equity ratio is based on the underlying credit quality of the assets . The following table presents DFS owned assets as of the dates indicated: January 31, 2025, February 2, 2024 .\n At our sole discretion, we may purchase, redeem, prepay, refinance, or otherwise retire any amount of our outstanding indebtedness under the terms of such indebtedness at any time and from time to time .

The transaction price reflects the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer . In certain hardware solutions, the hardware is highly interdependent on, and interrelated with, the embedded software .\n When a contract includes multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in proportion to the standalone selling price (SSP) of each obligation . SSP estimates rely, in part, on company pricing trends . Market conditions could impact the selling price in the current period which may not be reflective of trends, and could lead to revenue timing, classification, and segment differences .\n Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and whenever events or circumstances may indicate that an impairment has occurred . The fair value of each goodwill reporting unit is generally estimated using a combination of public company multiples and discounted cash flow methodologies . We may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test .\n Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the goodwill reporting unit, potentially resulting in a non-cash impairment charge . Fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is generally estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies . For more information about our goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report .\n We account for the tax impact of including Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) in U.S. taxable income as a period cost .

Dell Technologies is primarily exposed to interest rate risk related to its variable-rate debt portfolio . The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows related to the interest rate payments on suc. truments . DFS debt represents borrowings under securitization programs and structured financing programs .\n Dell Technologies’ interest rate risk exposure is limited to fluctuations in interest rates on unhedged borrowings where we do not mitigate the risk through the use of interest rate swaps . These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting and mark-to-market adjustments are recognized immediately within interest and other, net. h borrowings .\n As of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, we held strategic investments in non-marketable securities .
