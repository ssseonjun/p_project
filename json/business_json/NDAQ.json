Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was previously filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.\nThe period over period percentages below are calculated based on exact dollars, and therefore may not recalculate exactly using rounded numbers as presented in millions in the tables below. \nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nNasdaq is a global technology company serving corporate clients, investment managers, banks, brokers, and exchange operators as they navigate and interact with the global capital markets and the broader financial system. We aspire to deliver world-leading platforms that improve the liquidity, transparency, and integrity of the global economy. Our diverse offering of data, analytics, software, exchange capabilities, and client-centric services enables clients to optimize and execute their business vision with confidence.\nWe manage, operate and provide our products and services in three business segments: Capital Access Platforms, Financial Technology and Market Services.\n2024 Highlights\n•\nThroughout 2024, Nasdaq substantially completed the integration of AxiomSL and Calypso. \n•\nIn 2024, our Financial Technology segment delivered more than 10% ARR growth, reflecting an increase in new clients, cross-sells and upsells. \n•\nNasdaq extended listing leadership in 2024 with its sixth consecutive year as the top U.S. exchange by number of IPOs and proceeds raised.\n•\nIn 2024, Nasdaq achieved an 82% win rate among Nasdaq-eligible IPOs in the U.S., representing 180 deals and $23 billion in total proceeds raised.\n•\nIn 2024, our Index business had $80 billion of net inflows, including $28 billion in the fourth quarter, and reported its fifth consecutive record quarter in ETP AUM, reaching $647 billion as of December 31, 2024. In addition, the Index business launched a record 116 new products with its clients.\n•\nIn 2024, our Market Services segment achieved record net revenue. The Closing Cross set full year records in both share volume and notional value traded.\nMacroeconomic environment\nOur business performance can be positively or negatively impacted by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, current or expected inflation, interest rate fluctuations, market volatility, changes in investment patterns and priorities, regulatory changes, pandemics and other factors that are generally beyond our control. For example, higher overall U.S. trading volumes in 2024 as compared to 2023 has led to an increase in our U.S. Equity Derivative Trading and U.S. Cash Equity Trading revenues. Market factors also contributed to higher valuations in Nasdaq Indices. In our corporate solutions business, we managed through market challenges, as corporate buying cycles remained elongated throughout the year. To the extent that global or national economic conditions weaken and result in slower growth or recessions, our business may be negatively impacted. See “Part I,",

Risk Factors” for further discussion. \n36\nNasdaq\n’\ns Operating Results\nThe following table summarizes our financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The comparability of our results of operations between reported periods is impacted by the acquisition of Adenza in November 2023. See Note 4, “Acquisition,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. For a detailed discussion of our results of operations, see “Segment Operating Results” below.\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n \n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n \n \nRevenues less transaction-based expenses\n$\n4,649 \n$\n3,895 \n$\n3,582 \n19.4 \n%\n8.8 \n%\nOperating expenses\n2,851 \n2,317 \n2,018 \n23.0 \n%\n14.9 \n%\nOperating income\n$\n1,798 \n$\n1,578 \n$\n1,564 \n13.9 \n%\n0.8 \n%\nNet income attributable to Nasdaq\n$\n1,117 \n$\n1,059 \n$\n1,125 \n5.5 \n%\n(5.9)\n%\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n1.93 \n$\n2.08 \n$\n2.26 \n(7.4)\n%\n(7.8)\n%\nCash dividends declared per common share\n$\n0.94 \n$\n0.86 \n$\n0.78 \n9.3 \n%\n10.3 \n%\nIn countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Impacts on our revenues less transaction-based expenses and operating income associated with fluctuations in foreign currency are discussed in more detail under “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nThe following chart summarizes our ARR (in millions): \nARR for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature, or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.\n37\nThe ARR chart includes:\n▪\nCapital Access Platforms\n◦\nProprietary market data subscriptions and annual listing fees within our Data & Listing Services business\n◦\nIndex data subscriptions and guaranteed minimum on futures contracts within our Index business\n◦\nSubscription contracts under our Workflow & Insights business\n▪\nFinancial Technology\n◦\nFinancial Crime Management Technology SaaS subscription contracts excluding one-time service requests\n◦\nRegulatory Technology SaaS subscription and support contracts excluding one-time service requests\n◦\nCapital Markets Technology SaaS subscription and support contracts excluding one-time service requests\nThe following chart summarizes our quarterly annualized SaaS revenues for Solutions, which comprises our Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology segments, for December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\nSEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS\nThe following table presents our revenues by segment:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n \n(in millions)\n \nCapital Access Platforms\n$\n1,972 \n$\n1,770 \n$\n1,682 \n11.4 \n%\n5.2 \n%\nFinancial Technology\n1,621 \n1,099 \n864 \n47.5 \n%\n27.1 \n%\nMarket Services\n3,771 \n3,156 \n3,632 \n20.9 \n%\n(13.4)\n%\nOther revenues\n36 \n39 \n48 \n(8.6)\n%\n(16.9)\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n7,400 \n$\n6,064 \n$\n6,226 \n22.0 \n%\n(2.6)\n%\nTransaction rebates\n(2,026)\n(1,838)\n(2,092)\n10.2 \n%\n(12.1)\n%\nBrokerage, clearance and exchange fees\n(725)\n(331)\n(552)\n119.1 \n%\n(40.1)\n%\nTotal revenues less transaction-based expenses\n$\n4,649 \n$\n3,895 \n$\n3,582 \n19.4 \n%\n8.8 \n%\nThe following chart presents our Capital Access Platforms, Financial Technology and Market Services segments as a percentage of our total revenues, less transaction-based expenses. \n38\nCapital Access Platforms\nThe following tables present revenues and ARR from our Capital Access Platforms segment:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n \n(in millions)\n \nData & Listing Services\n$\n754 \n$\n749 \n$\n727 \n0.7 \n%\n3.0 \n%\nIndex\n706 \n528 \n486 \n33.7 \n%\n8.6 \n%\nWorkflow & Insights\n512 \n493 \n469 \n3.8 \n%\n5.2 \n%\nTotal Capital Access Platforms\n$\n1,972 \n$\n1,770 \n$\n1,682 \n11.4 \n%\n5.2 \n%\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nARR (in millions)\n$\n1,268 \n$\n1,235 \n$\n1,190 \nData & Listing Services Revenues\nThe following tables present key drivers from our Data & Listing Services business:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIPOs\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market\n180 \n130 \n161\nExchanges that comprise Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic\n14 \n7 \n38\nTotal new listings\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market\n463 \n330 \n366 \nExchanges that comprise Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic\n31 \n23 \n63\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumber of listed companies\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market\n4,075 \n4,044 \n4,230 \nExchanges that comprise Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic\n1,174 \n1,218 \n1,251 \nARR (in millions)\n691 \n682 \n664 \nIn the table above:\n•\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, IPOs included 50, 27 and 74 SPACs, respectively.

This change has no impact on reported AUM. \nIndex revenues increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher AUM in exchange traded products linked to Nasdaq indices and growth in trading volume on futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq-100 Index. The increase in 2024 also includes a $16 million one-time item related to a legal settlement to recoup revenue.\nWorkflow & Insights Revenues\nThe following table presents key drivers from our Workflow & Insights business:\nAs of or \nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nARR\n$\n501 \n$\n481 \n$\n458 \nQuarterly annualized SaaS revenues\n431 \n411 \n388 \nWorkflow & Insights revenues increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in analytics revenue, particularly our Data Link and eVestment product offerings.  \n39\nFinancial Technology\nThe following table presents revenues from our Financial Technology segment:\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n(in millions)\nFinancial Crime Management Technology\n$\n273 \n$\n223 \n$\n176 \n22.2 \n%\n26.5 \n%\nRegulatory Technology\n352 \n212 \n130 \n66.3 \n%\n63.5 \n%\nCapital Markets Technology\n996 \n664 \n558 \n50.0 \n%\n18.9 \n%\nTotal Financial Technology\n$\n1,621 \n$\n1,099 \n$\n864 \n47.5 \n%\n27.1 \n%\nFinancial Crime Management Technology Revenues\nThe following table presents key drivers for our Financial Crime Management Technology business:\nAs of or \nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nARR and Quarterly annualized SaaS revenues\n$\n278 \n$\n226 \n$\n182 \nFinancial Crime Management Technology revenues increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to revenue recognition from the full year impact of contracts signed in 2023, including higher value contracts, new sales and price increases to existing clients and new customer acquisitions, particularly small and medium-sized businesses.\nRegulatory Technology Revenues\nThe following table presents key drivers for our Regulatory Technology business:\nAs of or \nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nARR\n$\n354 \n$\n325 \n$\n130 \nQuarterly annualized SaaS revenues\n191 \n165 \n116 \nRegulatory Technology revenues increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from AxiomSL associated with our acquisition of Adenza and higher surveillance revenues, partially offset by a one-time revenue reduction recognized in the third quarter of 2024 related to a purchase accounting adjustment. See Note 3, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on the measurement period adjustment.\nCapital Markets Technology Revenues\nThe following table presents key drivers for our Capital Markets Technology business:\nAs of or \nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nARR \n$\n868 \n$\n799 \n$\n499 \nQuarterly annualized SaaS revenues\n134 \n108 \n39 \nCapital Markets Technology revenues increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from Calypso associated with our acquisition of Adenza. The increase was also driven by higher trade management services revenues mainly driven by demand for additional colocation and connectivity services following our recent data center expansion and higher market technology license and support revenues, partially offset by lower market technology professional services revenue due to a large project delivery in the comparable period in 2023\n.\nMarket Services\nThe following table presents revenues from our Market Services segment:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n \n(in millions)\n \nMarket Services \n$\n3,771 \n$\n3,156 \n$\n3,632 \n20.9 \n%\n(13.4)\n%\nTransaction-based expenses:\nTransaction rebates\n(2,026)\n(1,838)\n(2,092)\n10.2 \n%\n(12.1)\n%\nBrokerage, clearance and exchange fees\n(725)\n(331)\n(552)\n119.1 \n%\n(40.1)\n%\nTotal Market Services, net\n$\n1,020 \n$\n987 \n$\n988 \n3.4 \n%\n(0.1)\n%\nThe following table presents net revenues by product from our Market Services segment:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n \n(in millions)\nU.S. Equity Derivative Trading\n$\n395 \n$\n374 \n$\n371 \n5.7 \n%\n0.7 \n%\nCash Equity Trading\n430 \n397 \n397 \n8.3 \n%\n— \n%\nU.S. Tape plans\n125 \n141 \n149 \n(11.5)\n%\n(5.4)\n%\nOther\n70 \n75 \n71 \n(6.2)\n%\n4.6 \n%\nTotal Market Services, net\n$\n1,020 \n$\n987 \n$\n988 \n3.4 \n%\n(0.1)\n%\n40\nIn the preceding table, Other includes Nordic fixed income trading & clearing, Nordic derivatives and Canadian cash equities trading.\nU.S. Equity Derivative Trading \nThe following tables present total revenues, transaction-based expenses, and total revenues less transaction-based expenses as well as key drivers from our U.S. Equity Derivative Trading business:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n \n(in millions)\nU.S. Equity Derivative Trading Revenues\n$\n1,428 \n$\n1,257 \n$\n1,252 \n13.6 \n%\n0.4 \n%\nSection 31 fees\n87 \n55 \n89 \n56.9 \n%\n(37.9)\n%\nTransaction-based expenses:\n \nTransaction rebates\n(1,030)\n(879)\n(878)\n17.1 \n%\n0.2 \n%\nSection 31 fees\n(87)\n(55)\n(89)\n56.9 \n%\n(37.9)\n%\nBrokerage and clearance fees\n(3)\n(4)\n(3)\n(16.5)\n%\n13.9 \n%\nU.S. Equity Derivative Trading Revenues, net\n$\n395 \n$\n374 \n$\n371 \n5.7 \n%\n0.7 \n%\nSection 31 fees are recorded as U.S. equity derivative and cash equity trading revenues with a corresponding amount recorded in transaction-based expenses. We are assessed these fees from the SEC and pass them through to our customers in the form of incremental fees. Pass-through fees can increase or decrease due to rate changes by the SEC, our percentage of the overall industry volumes processed on our systems, and differences in actual dollar value traded. Section 31 fees increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher average SEC fee rates as a result of an increase in the SEC fee rate in May 2024. Since the amount recorded in revenues is equal to the amount recorded as Section 31 fees, there is no impact on our net revenues. \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nU.S. equity options\n \nTotal industry average daily volume (in millions)\n44.4 \n40.4 \n38.2 \nNasdaq PHLX matched market share\n10.0 \n%\n11.3 \n%\n11.6 \n%\nThe Nasdaq Options Market matched market share\n5.5 \n%\n6.1 \n%\n8.0 \n%\nNasdaq BX Options matched market share\n2.1 \n%\n3.3 \n%\n2.8 \n%\nNasdaq ISE Options matched market share\n6.9 \n%\n5.9 \n%\n5.7 \n%\nNasdaq GEMX Options matched market share\n2.6 \n%\n2.4 \n%\n2.3 \n%\nNasdaq MRX Options matched market share\n2.7 \n%\n2.0 \n%\n1.6 \n%\nTotal matched market share executed on Nasdaq’s exchanges\n29.8 \n%\n31.0 \n%\n32.0 \n%\nU.S. equity derivative trading revenues and U.S. equity derivative trading revenues, net increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher industry trading volumes, partially offset by lower overall matched market share executed on Nasdaq’s exchanges.

In January 2025, we entered into a new agreement to transfer existing open positions in our Nordic power derivatives trading and clearing business to a European exchange. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals. Revenues from this business will continue to be reflected in Other revenues. Prior to June 2023, these revenues were included in our Market Services and Capital Access Platforms segments. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Other revenues also include revenues related to a transitional services agreement associated with a divested business.

Prior to June 2022, these revenues were included in our Market Services and Capital Access Platforms segments. \nEXPENSES\nOperating Expenses \nThe following table presents our operating expenses:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n \n(in millions)\n \nCompensation and benefits\n$\n1,324 \n$\n1,082 \n$\n1,003 \n22.4%\n7.9%\nProfessional and contract services\n152 \n128 \n140 \n18.4%\n(8.6)%\nTechnology and communication infrastructure\n281 \n233 \n207 \n20.9%\n12.7%\nOccupancy\n112 \n129 \n104 \n(12.9)%\n23.7%\nGeneral, administrative and other\n109 \n113 \n125 \n(3.6)%\n(9.8)%\nMarketing and advertising\n54 \n47 \n51 \n16.4%\n(8.8)%\nDepreciation and amortization\n613 \n323 \n258 \n89.3%\n25.5%\nRegulatory\n55 \n34 \n33 \n60.8%\n4.4%\nMerger and strategic initiatives\n35 \n148 \n82 \n(76.5)%\n79.7%\nRestructuring charges\n116 \n80 \n15 \n44.3%\n454.5%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n2,851 \n$\n2,317 \n$\n2,018 \n23.0%\n14.9%\nThe increase in compensation and benefits expense in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by the inclusion of a full year of compensation costs related to Adenza employees as compared to two months in 2023, a pre-tax charge of $23 million resulting from the finalization of the termination of our pension plan and higher incentive compensation.\nHeadcount, including employees of non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries, increased to 9,162 employees as of December 31, 2024 from 8,525 employees as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in our Financial Technology segment as we support revenue growth and innovation.\nProfessional and contract services expense increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in expenses related to the inclusion of Adenza.\nTechnology and communication infrastructure expense increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in expenses related to the inclusion of Adenza and an increase in investment in technology expense related to our cloud initiatives and software licensing.\nOccupancy expense decreased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to $18 million in impairment charges and exit related costs recorded in 2023 following the abandonment of leased office space, partially offset by an increase in costs related to the inclusion of Adenza office space. \nGeneral, administrative and other expense decreased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to a one-time accrual in 2023 related to a legal matter, partially offset by the inclusion of Adenza expense for a full year in 2024 and insurance recoveries related to legal matters recorded in 2023.\nMarketing and advertising expense increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher client incentive spending resulting from higher IPO activity.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in amortization related to the intangible assets acquired as part of the Adenza acquisition.\nRegulatory expense increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to the settlement of a previously disclosed SFSA inquiry.\n43\nWe have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and \ndivestitures i\nn recent years, which have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. These expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third-party transaction costs and vary based on the size and frequency of the activities described above. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, these costs primarily relate to the Adenza acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2024, these costs were partially offset by the recognition of a termination fee received by Nasdaq in 2024 related to the termination of the proposed divestiture of our Nordic power trading and clearing business.\nRestructuring charges increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 as a result of charges from our Adenza restructuring program, which we implemented to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization, and our divisional alignment program, which was completed in September 2024. \nWe further expanded our Adenza restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2024 to accelerate our momentum. In connection with this program, we expect to incur approximately $140 million in pre-tax charges. Actions taken as part of this program are expected to be completed by the end of 2025, while certain costs may be recognized in the first half of 2026. We expect to achieve benefits primarily in the form of expense synergies with annual cost savings of $140 million by the end of 2025, inclusive of the $80 million of net expense synergies related to the AxiomSL and Calypso acquisition.\nThe divisional alignment program concluded on September 30, 2024, incurring total pre-tax charges of $139 million over a two-year period, within the projected range of $115 million to $145 million. In addition to significantly boosting the scalability of our platforms, and thus revenue opportunities, we expect to achieve benefits from the 2022 divisional alignment program through combined annual run-rate operational efficiencies of approximately $30 million annually by 2025.\nFor further discussion related to both programs described above, see Note 20, “Restructuring Charges,” to the consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nThe following table presents our non-operating income and expenses:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. \n2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n \n(in millions)\nInterest income\n$\n28 \n$\n115 \n$\n7 \n(75.5)\n%\n1,538.3 \n%\nInterest expense\n(414)\n(284)\n(129)\n45.6 \n%\n120.2 \n%\nNet interest expense\n(386)\n(169)\n(122)\n128.3 \n%\n38.4 \n%\nOther income (loss)\n21 \n(1)\n2 \n(5,232.5)\n%\n(121.9)\n%\nNet income (loss) from unconsolidated investees\n16 \n(7)\n31 \n(328.7)\n%\n(122.9)\n%\nTotal non-operating expense\n$\n(349)\n$\n(177)\n$\n(89)\n97.4 \n%\n96.7 \n%\nThe following table presents our interest expense:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n \n(in millions)\n \nInterest expense on debt\n$\n398 \n$\n272 \n$\n120 \n46.3 \n%\n126.8 \n%\nAccretion of debt issuance costs and debt discount\n13 \n9 \n7 \n33.9 \n%\n37.0 \n%\nOther fees\n3 \n3 \n2 \n18.7 \n%\n21.2 \n%\nInterest expense\n$\n414 \n$\n284 \n$\n129 \n45.6 \n%\n120.2 \n%\nInterest income decreased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to a higher cash balance in 2023 during the period between the issuance of the senior unsecured notes in June 2023 and the close of the Adenza acquisition in November 2023.\nInterest expense increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to debt issued in June 2023 to finance the Adenza acquisition. See “Financing of the Adenza Acquisition,” of Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nOther income (loss) primarily represents realized and unrealized gains and losses from strategic investments related to our corporate venture program.\nNet income (loss) from unconsolidated investees increased in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher income recognized from our equity method investment in OCC and lower losses from our equity method investment in NPM. See “Equity Method Investments,” of Note 6, “Investments,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n44\nTax Matters\nThe following table presents our income tax provision and effective tax rate:\nYear Ended December 31,\nPercentage Change\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n(in millions)\nIncome tax provision\n$\n334\n$\n344\n$\n352\n(2.8)\n%\n(2.1)\n%\nEffective tax rate\n23.1 \n%\n24.6 \n%\n23.9 \n%\nFor further discussion of our tax matters, see Note 17, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we also provide non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating performance.\nThese measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.\nWe understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, to assess operating performance. We use non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance. \nThe following table presents reconciliations between U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and diluted earnings per share and non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and diluted earnings per share:\n45\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nU.S. GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq\n$\n1,117 \n$\n1,059 \n$\n1,125 \nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAdenza purchase accounting adjustment\n34 \n— \n— \nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets\n488 \n206 \n153 \nMerger and strategic initiatives expense\n35 \n148 \n82 \nRestructuring charges\n116 \n80 \n15 \nLease asset impairments\n— \n25 \n— \nExtinguishment of debt\n4 \n— \n16 \nNet (income) loss from unconsolidated investees\n(16)\n7 \n(29)\nLegal and regulatory matters\n20 \n12 \n26 \nPension settlement charge\n23 \n9 \n— \nOther (income) loss\n(15)\n21 \n2 \nTotal non-GAAP adjustments\n$\n689 \n$\n508 \n$\n265 \nTotal non-GAAP tax adjustments\n(208)\n(134)\n(66)\nTax on intra-group transfer of IP assets\n33 \n— \n— \nTotal non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax\n$\n514 \n$\n374 \n$\n199 \nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq\n$\n1,631 \n$\n1,433 \n$\n1,324 \nU.S. GAAP effective tax rate\n23.1 \n%\n24.6 \n%\n23.9 \n%\nTotal adjustments from non-GAAP tax rate\n0.7 \n%\n0.4 \n%\n0.1 \n%\nNon-GAAP effective tax rate\n23.8 \n%\n25.0 \n%\n24.0 \n%\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share\n579.2 \n508.4 \n497.9 \nU.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share\n$\n1.93 \n$\n2.08 \n$\n2.26 \nTotal adjustments from non-GAAP net income\n0.89 \n0.74 \n0.40 \nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share\n$\n2.82 \n$\n2.82 \n$\n2.66 \nWe believe that excluding the following items from the non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq provides a more meaningful analysis of Nasdaq’s ongoing operating performance and comparisons in Nasdaq’s performance between periods:\n•\nAdenza purchase accounting adjustment: \nAs discussed in Note 3, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” to the consolidated financial statements, during the third quarter of 2024, as part of finalizing the purchase accounting of the Adenza acquisition, a one-time revenue reduction of $32 million was recorded, reflecting the net impact of the accounting change on AxiomSL subscription revenue from the date of the Adenza acquisition. We have excluded the reduction of $34 million as this relates to the prior year impact of this change from our non-GAAP results. We have not excluded the $2 million offsetting impact of this change as it is related to current year results.  \n•\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets: \nWe amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses and the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods.\n•\nMerger and strategic initiatives expense:\n We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years that have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. These expenses primarily include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third-party transaction costs. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, these costs primarily relate to the Adenza acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2024, these costs were partially offset by the recognition of a termination fee received by Nasdaq in 2024, related to the termination of the proposed divestiture of our Nordic power trading and clearing business.\n•\nRestructuring charges:\n In the fourth quarter of 2023, following the closing of the Adenza acquisition, our management approved, committed to and initiated a restructuring program, to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization. We further expanded this restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2024 to accelerate our momentum. In October 2022, following our September 2022 announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. We completed this program in September 2024. See Note 20, “Restructuring Charges,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these programs. \n46\n•\nNet (income) loss from unconsolidated investees\n: We exclude our share of the earnings and losses of our equity method investments. This provides a more meaningful analysis of Nasdaq’s ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq’s performance between periods. See “Equity Method Investments,” of Note 6, “Investments,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. \n•\nOther items: \nWe have excluded certain other charges or gains, including certain tax items, that are the result of other non-comparable events to measure operating performance. We believe the exclusion of such amounts allows management and investors to better understand the ongoing financial results of Nasdaq. Other significant items include: \n◦\nLease asset impairments: \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, other items include impairment charges related to our operating lease assets and leasehold improvements associated with vacating certain leased office space, which are recorded in occupancy and depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 16, “Leases,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. \n◦\nExtinguishment of debt:\n For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022 this includes a loss on extinguishment of debt, which is recorded under general, administrative and other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n◦\nLegal and regulatory matters: \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, other items primarily include the settlement of a previously disclosed SFSA inquiry, and accruals related to certain legal matters. For 2023 and 2022, other items also includes accruals related to certain legal matters. For 2023, these charges were partially offset by insurance recoveries related to certain legal matters. The charges and related insurance recoveries are recorded in professional and contract services and general, administrative and other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For 2022, this also includes a charge related to an administrative fine imposed by the SFSA related to the clearing default that occurred in 2018. This charge was included in regulatory expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n◦\nPension settlement charge: \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a pre-tax charge as a result of settling our U.S. pension plan. The plan was terminated and partially settled in 2023, with final settlement occurring during the first quarter of 2024. The pre-tax charge is recorded in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 10, “Retirement Plans,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n◦\nOther (income) loss\n: For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, other items include net gains from strategic investments entered into through our corporate venture program, which are included in other income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For 2023, other items included certain financing costs related to the Adenza acquisition and a net loss from a strategic investments entered into through our corporate venture program.\n•\nSignificant tax items: \nThe non-GAAP adjustment to the income tax provision for all periods primarily includes the tax impact of each non-GAAP adjustment. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2024, tax items also include a one-time net tax expense of $33 million related to the completion of an intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property, or IP, assets to our U.S. headquarters as well as a tax benefit related to return to provision adjustments and release of tax reserves due to lapse in statute of limitations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHistorically, we have funded our operating activities and met our commitments through cash generated by operations, augmented by the periodic issuance of debt. Currently, our cost and availability of funding remain healthy. We continue to prudently assess our capital deployment strategy through balancing internal investments, debt repayments, and shareholder return activity, including dividends and share repurchases, and potential acquisitions.\nWe expect that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our borrowing capacity and access to additional financing, including our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program, provides us additional flexibility to meet our ongoing obligations and the capital deployment strategic actions described above, while allowing us to invest in activities and product development that support the long-term growth of our operations. \nPrincipal factors that could affect the availability of our internally-generated funds include:\n•    deterioration of our revenues in any of our business segments;\n•    changes in regulatory and working capital requirements; and\n•\nan increase in our expenses.\nPrincipal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:\n•    operating covenants contained in our credit facilities that limit our total borrowing capacity;\n•    credit rating downgrades, which could limit our access to additional debt;\n•    a significant decrease in the market price of our common stock; and\n•    volatility or disruption in the public debt and equity markets.\n47\nThe following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n(in millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n592 \n$\n453 \nFinancial investments\n184 \n188 \nWorking capital\n(116)\n71 \nThe decrease in working capital is primarily driven by the reclassification of the 2025 Notes to short-term debt in 2024 and an increase in current deferred revenue, partially offset by a decrease in commercial paper, net, as further described below under “\nDebt Obligations.\n”\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes all non-restricted cash in banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy, and alternative investment choices. As of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents of $592 million were primarily invested in money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits.\nRepatriation of Cash\nOur cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. in various foreign subsidiaries totaled $181 million as of December 31, 2024 and $236 million as of December 31, 2023. The remaining balance held in the U.S. totaled $411 million as of December 31, 2024 and $217 million as of December 31, 2023. \nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following table summarizes the changes in cash flows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by (used in):\n(in millions)\nOperating activities\n$\n1,939 \n$\n1,696 \n$\n1,706 \nInvesting activities\n(953)\n(5,994)\n49 \nFinancing activities\n(2,561)\n4,220 \n1,036 \nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization expense, expense associated with share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and the effects of changes in working capital. Changes in working capital include changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue which are impacted by the timing of customer billings and related collections from our customers; accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of payments; accrued personnel costs, which are impacted by employee performance targets and the timing of payments related to employee bonus incentives; and Section 31 fees payable to the SEC, which is impacted by the changes in SEC fee rates and the timing of collections from customers and payments to the SEC.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $243 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net income and the impact of certain non-cash items on net income, primarily an increase in amortization expense due to acquired intangibles related to the Adenza acquisitions offset by a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities. \nThe changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily included higher Section 31 fees payable to the SEC due to changes in Section 31 fee rate between periods, partially offset by higher cash outflows from accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily due to interest paid relating to the senior unsecured notes and the settlement of a legal matter, and higher cash outflows from higher receivables, net, primarily due to higher Market Services receivables driven by higher Section 31 fee rate as well as higher billings. \nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to net purchases of investments related to default funds and margin deposits of $707 million, purchases of property and equipment of $207 million, other investing activities primarily related to our corporate venture program of $32 million and net purchases of trading securities, net, of $7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to $5,766 million paid for the acquisition of Adenza, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, purchases of property and equipment of $158 million, net purchases of investments related to default funds and margin deposits of $74 million and $3 million from other investing activities, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and redemption of trading securities, net of $7 million.\n48\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily related to a decrease in default funds and margin deposits of $1,030 million, dividend payments to our shareholders of $541 million, 2023 Term Loan repayment of $340 million, net repayments of our commercial paper of $291 million, repayments of debt and credit commitments of $181 million and repurchases of common stock of $145 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily related to $5,608 million in proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes and the 2023 Term Loan, in connection with the Adenza acquisition, net of debt issuance costs partially offset by dividend payments to our shareholders of $441 million, repayments of our commercial paper, net of $371 million, repurchases of common stock of $269 million and partial repayment of the 2023 Term Loan of $260 million.\nSee Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt obligations.\nSee “Share Repurchase Program,” and “Cash Dividends on Common Stock,” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders’ Equity,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our share repurchase program and cash dividends declared and paid on our common stock. \nFinancial Investments\nOur financial investments totaled $184 million as of December 31, 2024 and $188 million as of December 31, 2023. Of these securities, $171 million as of December 31, 2024 and $168 million as of December 31, 2023 are assets primarily utilized to meet regulatory capital requirements, mainly for our clearing operations at Nasdaq Clearing. See Note 6, “Investments,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. \nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nClearing Operations Regulatory Capital Requirements\nWe are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital for the clearing operations of Nasdaq Clearing. The level of regulatory capital required to be maintained is dependent upon many factors, including market conditions and creditworthiness of the counterparty. As of December 31, 2024, our required regulatory capital of $129 million was primarily comprised of highly rated European government debt securities that are included in financial investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nBroker-Dealer Net Capital Requirements\nOur broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services, NFSTX, LLC, and Nasdaq Capital Markets Advisory, are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity. These requirements obligate these subsidiaries to comply with minimum net capital requirements. As of December 31, 2024, the combined required minimum net capital totaled $1 million and the combined excess capital totaled $24 million, substantially all of which is held in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The required minimum net capital is included in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nNordic and Baltic Exchange Regulatory Capital Requirements\nThe entities that operate trading venues in the Nordic and Baltic countries are each subject to local regulations and are required to maintain regulatory capital intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity. As of December 31, 2024, our required regulatory capital of $35 million was primarily invested in European government bills and mortgage bonds that are included in financial investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash, which is included in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nOther Capital Requirements\nWe operate several other businesses which are subject to local regulation and are required to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2024, other required regulatory capital of $12 million, primarily related to Nasdaq Central Securities Depository, was primarily invested in European government debt securities that are included in financial investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEquity and dividends\nShare Repurchase Program\nSee “Share Repurchase Program,” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders’ Equity,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our share repurchase program.\nCash Dividends on Common Stock\nThe following table presents our quarterly cash dividends paid per common share on our outstanding common stock:\n2024\n2023\nFirst quarter\n$\n0.22 \n$\n0.20 \nSecond quarter\n0.24 \n0.22 \nThird quarter\n0.24 \n0.22 \nFourth quarter\n0.24 \n0.22 \nTotal\n$\n0.94 \n$\n0.86 \nSee “Cash Dividends on Common Stock,” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders’ Equity,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the dividends. \n49\nDebt Obligations\nThe debt obligations, by contractual maturity, at December 31, 2024 are as follows (in U.S. Dollar millions):\nn\n Euro Notes  \nn\n U.S. Notes \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we repurchased an aggregate amount of $181 million of outstanding notes, primarily related to the 2025 Notes, 2028 Notes and 2034 Notes. In February 2025, Nasdaq commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase up to an aggregate principal amount of $200 million of our 2028, 2034 and 2052 Notes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on our debt obligations was approximately 3.95%. This rate can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates for our variable rate debts, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the amount and duration of outstanding debt. In addition to the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, we also have other credit facilities primarily to support our Nasdaq Clearing operations in Europe, as well as to provide a cash pool credit line. These European credit facilities, which are available in multiple currencies, totaled $174 million as of December 31, 2024 and $191 million as of December 31, 2023 in available liquidity, none of which was utilized.\nFinancing of the Adenza Acquisition\nIn June 2023, Nasdaq issued six series of notes for total proceeds of $5,016 million, net of debt issuance costs of $38 million, with various maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2063. The net proceeds from these notes were used to finance the majority of the cash consideration due in connection with the Adenza acquisition.\nIn addition, in connection with the financing of the Adenza acquisition, we entered into the 2023 Term Loan agreement. The 2023 Term Loan provided us with the ability to borrow up to $600 million to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Adenza acquisition and other amounts incurred in connection with this transaction. On November 1, 2023, we borrowed $599 million, net of fees, under this term loan, which was used towards payment of the cash consideration due in connection with the Adenza acquisition, a portion of which had been repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023. The term loan was fully repaid in 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our debt obligations.\nSee Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt obligations.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS\nNasdaq has contractual obligations to make future payments under debt obligations by contract maturity, operating lease payments, and other obligations. The following table summarizes material cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024, and the estimated timing thereof.\n50\nPayments Due by Period\n(in millions)\nTotal\n<1 year\n1-3 years\n3-5 years\n5+ years\nDebt obligation by contractual maturity\n$\n15,252 \n$\n761 \n$\n1,171 \n$\n2,148 \n$\n11,172 \nOperating lease obligations\n617 \n75 \n140 \n129 \n273 \nPurchase obligations\n384 \n96 \n115 \n89 \n84 \nTotal\n$\n16,253 \n$\n932 \n$\n1,426 \n$\n2,366 \n$\n11,529 \nIn the table above:\n•\nDebt obligations by contractual maturity include both principal and interest obligations. For our Euro denominated notes interest is calculated on an actual basis while all other debt obligations were primarily calculated on a 365-day basis at the contractual fixed rate multiplied by the aggregate principal amount as of December 31, 2024. See Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n•\nOperating lease obligations represent our undiscounted operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024, as well as legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced. See Note 16, “Leases,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our leases.\n•\nPurchase obligations primarily represent minimum outstanding obligations due under software license agreements. The balance as of December 31, 2024 is primarily comprised of our multi-year AWS partnership contract.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nFor discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements see:\n•    Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our non-cash default fund contributions and margin deposits received for clearing operations; and\n•    Note 18, “Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of:\n◦\nGuarantees issued and credit facilities available;\n◦\nOther guarantees; and\n◦\nRouting brokerage activities.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a result of our operating, investing and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. We are also exposed to credit risk as a result of our normal business activities.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and the board of directors. We identify risk exposures and monitor and manage such risks on a daily basis.\nWe perform sensitivity analyses to determine the effects of market risk exposures. We may use derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to our financial positions or risks that are incurred during the normal course of business. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financial investments and debt obligations, which are discussed below. Substantially all of our debt obligations are fixed-rate obligations. We may enter into transactions that expose us to interest rate risk, for which we may utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage that risk.\nFinancial Investments\nAs of December 31, 2024, our investment portfolio was primarily comprised of highly rated European government debt securities, which pay a fixed rate of interest. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and the fair value of these securities will decrease if market interest rates increase. The impact of an immediate increase to market interest rates, uniformly, by a hypothetical 100 basis points from levels as of December 31, 2024, would not have a material impact on our financial statements. \nDebt Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2024, substantially all of our debt obligations are fixed-rate obligations. Interest rates on certain tranches of notes are subject to adjustment to the extent our debt rating is downgraded below investment grade, as further discussed in Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements. While changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on fixed-rate obligations, we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of the borrowings under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, as this facility has a variable interest rate. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of the amounts outstanding from the sale of commercial paper under our commercial paper program, which have variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility or commercial paper program.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our primary transactional exposure to foreign currency denominated revenues less transaction-based expenses and operating income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is presented in the following tables:\n51\nEuro\nSwedish Krona\nCanadian Dollar\nOther Foreign Currencies\nU.S. Dollar\n(in millions, except currency rate)\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nAverage foreign currency rate to the U.S. dollar\n1.082\n0.095\n0.730\n# \nN/A\nPercentage of revenues less transaction-based expenses\n7.9%\n3.4%\n0.7%\n3.7%\n84.3%\nPercentage of operating income\n11.8%\n(5.9)%\n(7.8)%\n(10.5)%\n112.4%\nImpact of a 10% adverse currency fluctuation on revenues less transaction-based expenses\n$(37)\n$(16)\n$(3)\n$(17)\n$—\nImpact of a 10% adverse currency fluctuation on operating income\n$(21)\n$(11)\n$(14)\n$(19)\n$—\nEuro\nSwedish Krona\nCanadian Dollar\nOther Foreign Currencies\nU.S. Dollar\n(in millions, except currency rate)\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nAverage foreign currency rate to the U.S. dollar\n1.081\n0.094\n0.741\n# \nN/A\nPercentage of revenues less transaction-based expenses\n6.6%\n4.0%\n0.8%\n3.0%\n85.6%\nPercentage of operating income\n10.7%\n(3.8)%\n(7.0)%\n(8.3)%\n108.4%\nImpact of a 10% adverse currency fluctuation on revenues less transaction-based expenses\n$(26)\n$(15)\n$(3)\n$(12)\n$—\nImpact of a 10% adverse currency fluctuation on operating income\n$(17)\n$(6)\n$(11)\n$(13)\n$—\n__________\n#    Represents multiple foreign currency rates.\nN/A    Not applicable.\nThe adverse impacts shown in the preceding tables should be viewed individually by currency and not in aggregate due to the correlation between changes in exchange rates for certain currencies. Additionally, the table does not include the offsetting impact of our hedging programs.\nWe may use foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses in the normal course of business. We do not use these contracts for speculative trading purposes. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value, with maturities that can range up to 24 months. We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue or operating expenses, as applicable. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive loss to revenue or operating expenses, as applicable. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of our derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments are not material. \nOur investments in foreign subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of the foreign subsidiaries’ net assets or equity to U.S. dollars. Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting using a current rate of exchange, with net gains or losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOur primary exposure to net assets in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2024 is presented in the following table:\n \nNet Assets\nImpact of a 10% Adverse Currency Fluctuation\n \n(in millions)\nSwedish Krona\n$\n2,737 \n$\n(274)\nBritish Pound\n136 \n(14)\nNorwegian Krone\n134 \n(13)\nCanadian Dollar\n107 \n(11)\nAustralian Dollar\n89 \n(9)\nIn the table above, Swedish Krona includes goodwill of $2,028 million and intangible assets, net of $439 million.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the potential loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of customers or counterparties. We are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We limit our \n52\nexposure to credit risk by evaluating the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements. For our investment portfolio, our objective is to invest in securities to preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. Credit risk associated with investments is minimized substantially by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments which have investment grade ratings, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties. \nOur subsidiary, Nasdaq Execution Services, may be exposed to credit risk due to the default of trading counterparties in connection with the routing services it provides for our trading customers. System trades in cash equities routed to other market centers for members of our cash equity exchanges are routed by Nasdaq Execution Services for clearing to the NSCC. In this function, Nasdaq Execution Services is to be neutral by the end of the trading day, but may be exposed to intraday risk if a trade extends beyond the trading day and into the next day, thereby leaving Nasdaq Execution Services susceptible to counterparty risk in the period between accepting the trade and routing it to the clearinghouse. In this interim period, Nasdaq Execution Services is not novating like a clearing broker but instead is subject to the short-term risk of counterparty failure before the clearinghouse enters the transaction. Once the clearinghouse officially accepts the trade for novation, Nasdaq Execution Services is legally removed from trade execution risk. However, Nasdaq has membership obligations to NSCC independent of Nasdaq Execution Services’ arrangements.\nPursuant to the rules of the NSCC and Nasdaq Execution Services’ clearing agreement, Nasdaq Execution Services is liable for any losses incurred due to a counterparty or a clearing agent’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations, either by making payment or delivering securities. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are subject to these transactions can increase our credit risk. However, we believe that the risk of material loss is limited, as Nasdaq Execution Services’ customers are not permitted to trade on margin and NSCC rules limit counterparty risk on self-cleared transactions by establishing credit limits and capital deposit requirements for all brokers that clear with NSCC. Historically, Nasdaq Execution Services has never incurred a liability due to a customer’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade. Credit difficulties or insolvency, or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency, of one or more larger or visible market participants could also result in market-wide credit difficulties or other market disruptions. \nWe have credit risk related to transaction and subscription-based revenues that are billed to customers on a monthly or quarterly basis, in arrears. Our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties’ creditworthiness. Credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe also are exposed to credit risk through our clearing operations with Nasdaq Clearing. See Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Our clearinghouse holds material amounts of clearing member cash deposits, which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the clearinghouse may remit to the members interest earned at prevailing market rates, less a spread, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.\n•\nCredit Risk: \nWhen the clearinghouse has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearinghouse utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. When funds are not held at a central bank, we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk by ensuring that investments are primarily placed in large, highly rated financial institutions, highly rated government debt instruments and other creditworthy counterparties.\n•\nLiquidity Risk:\n Liquidity risk is the risk a clearinghouse may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearinghouse monitors liquidity requirements closely and maintains funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearinghouse to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or investing in highly liquid government debt instruments serves to reduce liquidity risks.\n•\nInterest Rate Risk: \nInterest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. Our clearinghouse seeks to manage this risk by making short term investments of members’ cash deposits. In addition, the clearinghouse investment guidelines allow for direct purchases or repurchase agreements with short dated maturities of high quality sovereign debt (for example, European government and U.S. Treasury securities), central bank certificates and multilateral development bank debt instruments.\n53\n•\nSecurity Issuer Risk:\n Security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments and collateral under reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign, government agency or multilateral development bank debt instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies\n.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs part of our market technology product offering, within our Capital Markets Technology business, we enter into certain long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license the right to use software and provide support and other services to our customers which results in these contracts containing multiple performance obligations. We allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. In instances where standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the standalone selling price predominantly through an expected cost plus a margin approach.\nWe generally recognize revenue over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by our performance because our customer controls the asset for which we are creating, our performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and we have a right to payment for performance completed to date. For these services, we recognize revenue over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby depicts, the transfer of control to the customer.\nAccounting for our long-term contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for schedule and technical issues, \nproductivity and the complexity of work performed. Revenue and cost estimates for our long-term contracts are reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly. When adjustments in estimated total contract costs are required, any changes in the estimated revenues from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the effect of such change. If estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. \nOur Calypso product, also part of our Capital Markets Technology business, provides cross-asset, front-to-back trading, treasury, risk and collateral management solutions for the financial markets. This offering is also provided as an on-premises software solution. A license for on-premises software provides customers with the right to use the software at its current state at the time made available to the customer. These contracts generally consist of the following distinct performance obligations: license and PCS. In allocating the contractual price to each performance obligation, we have used our best estimate of the stand-alone selling price. Consideration is first allocated to performance obligations with established stand-alone selling prices based on observable evidence, with the residual being split between license and PCS.\nLicense revenue is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer as this is the point the user of the software can direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the software license. PCS revenue is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract period beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service.\nAccounting for these contracts requires judgment relative to the allocation of the contractual price to each performance obligation.\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process, as discussed above, changes in assumptions and estimates may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.\nFor further discussion related to recognition of these revenues, see “Revenue From Contracts with Customers - Revenue Recognition - Capital Markets Technology,” of Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness Combination\nWe account for business acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions are recorded at the date of acquisition at their estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Within one year from the date of acquisition, we may update the value allocated to the assets acquired and \n54\nliabilities assumed, and the resulting goodwill balance, based on information received regarding the valuation of such assets and liabilities that was not available at the time of purchase.\nWe use various methods to determine fair value depending on the type of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including, but not limited to, forecasted revenue, cash flows, attrition rates, long term growth rates, royalty rates, EBITDA margin and discount rates.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in assigning useful lives to certain definite-lived intangible and tangible assets. Accordingly, we may engage third-party valuation specialists to assist in these determinations. The fair value estimates are based on available information as of the acquisition date and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain.\nIn the third quarter of 2024 we recorded a purchase accounting adjustment to the estimated purchase price allocation shown above, and disclosed as of December 31, 2023. This adjustment relates to the impact of the change from upfront to ratable revenue recognition for AxiomSL on-premises contracts entered into prior to the acquisition date, as described above, and decreased accrued income (which reflects revenue earned but not yet billed and included in receivables above) by $46 million, increased deferred revenue by $56 million and increased goodwill by $77 million, net of a deferred tax asset of $25 million. During 2023 and 2022, we have not recorded any material measurement period adjustments to purchase price allocations.\nSee Note 4, “Acquisition,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Adenza Acquisition.\nGoodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Related Impairment Testing\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, of a business acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, technology, exchange and clearing registrations, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily exchange and clearing registrations, are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually as of October 1 and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount, such as changes in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. We perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level for our three reporting units: Capital \nAccess Platforms, Financial Technology and Market Services segments.\nWhen testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than their respective carrying amounts as the basis to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit or the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds their respective estimated fair values, a quantitative test is required. Our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the size of the reporting unit’s goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value or the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value over their respective carrying amounts at the last quantitative assessment date, and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments.\nIn performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset with their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow valuation, which incorporates assumptions regarding future growth rates, terminal values, and discount rates, as well as guideline public company valuations, which incorporates relevant trading multiples of comparable companies and other factors. The estimates and assumptions used consider historical performance and are consistent with the assumptions used in determining future profit plans for each reporting unit, which are approved by our board of directors. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is primarily determined on the basis of estimated discounted value, using the Greenfield Approach for exchange and clearing registrations and licenses, and the relief from royalty approach or excess earnings approach for trade names, both of which incorporate assumptions regarding future revenue projections and discount rates. If the carrying amounts of the reporting unit or the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceed their respective fair values, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the difference, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit or the total carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of goodwill for our reportable segments at the time of our 2024 annual impairment test:\n \nOctober 1, 2024\n(in millions)\nCapital Access Platforms\n$\n4,210 \nFinancial Technology \n7,945 \nMarket Services\n2,010 \n \n$\n14,165 \n55\nIn 2024, we performed a qualitative impairment test for goodwill on all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, as the excesses of their fair values over their respective carrying amounts, at the time of the last quantitative test in 2023, were significant. In conducting the qualitative assessment, we evaluated the performance of each of these reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets since the last quantitative test, as well as future financial projections to determine if there were any changes in the key inputs used to determine their respective fair values. We also considered the qualitative factors in FASB ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles–Goodwill and Other,” as well as other relevant events and circumstances. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset, and the predominance of positive indicators and the weight of such indicators, we concluded that the fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are more likely than not greater than their respective carrying amounts and as a result, quantitative analyses were not needed. No impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets was recorded in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nAlthough we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, the determination of certain valuation inputs is subject to management’s judgment. Changes in these inputs could materially affect the results of our impairment review. If our forecasts of cash flows or other key inputs are negatively revised in the future, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would be adversely impacted, potentially leading to an impairment in the future that could materially affect our operating results.\nSubsequent to our annual impairment test, no indications of impairment were identified.\nOther Long-Lived Assets and Related Impairment\nWe review our other long-lived assets, such as finite-lived intangible assets, property and equipment, and operating lease assets for potential impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Fair value of finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment is based on various valuation techniques. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to operating results.\nThere were no material finite-lived intangible assets impairment charges in 2024, 2023 and 2022.  \nWe recorded pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment asset impairment charges, primarily in relation to our restructuring programs of $37 million in 2024, $12 million in 2023 and $8 million in 2022. See Note 20, “Restructuring Charges,” to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these plans.\nIn 2023, we initiated a review of our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. As a result of this ongoing review, we recorded impairment charges of $23 million in 2023 of which $18 million related to operating lease asset impairment and exit costs and is included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and $5 million related to impairment of leasehold improvements, which are recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  \nNo material impairments were recorded to reduce the carrying value of our other long-lived assets during 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nEstimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. Our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the recognition thresholds, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. \nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in such jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest may be due. While we believe that our tax liabilities reflect the probable outcome of identified tax uncertainties, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may be greater or less than the \n56\namount accrued. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInformation about quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is incorporated herein by reference from “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNasdaq’s consolidated financial statements, including Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and notes to our consolidated financial statements, together with a report thereon of Ernst & Young LLP, dated February 21, 2025, are attached hereto as pages F-1 through F-44 and incorporated by reference herein.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nNasdaq’s management, with the participation of Nasdaq’s Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of Nasdaq’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, Nasdaq’s Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that, as of the end of such period, Nasdaq’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n There have been no changes in Nasdaq’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Nasdaq’s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in the reports that we file with the SEC. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments.\nManagement is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over Nasdaq’s financial reporting. Although there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, or ICFR, we maintain a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 framework). This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on its assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. \nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on Nasdaq’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.\n57\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Nasdaq, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Nasdaq, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Nasdaq, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/\n Ernst & Young LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 21, 2025 \n58\nItem 9B.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosure to which it relates.\nCalypso and AxiomSL on-premises license revenue recognition\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue within its Regulatory Technology and Capital Markets Technology products for AxiomSL and Calypso on-premises license agreements, respectively. The AxiomSL on-premises software offering includes both license and post-contract customer support, which includes frequent and ongoing mandatory regulatory updates. Both the AxiomSL on-premises license and the post-contract customer support, inclusive of the frequent and ongoing mandatory regulatory updates are accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratably over the contract term. For the on-premises Calypso capital markets product, distinct performance obligations are recognized for the license and post-contract customer support and the performance obligation of the on-premises license revenue is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the user.\nAuditing the Company’s initial identification of performance obligations along with the timing over which those performance obligations are satisfied for the acquired AxiomSL and Calypso on-premise license agreements required complex judgment. \nF-2\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, performed a walkthrough of the process and evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's processes for identifying performance obligations and determining the timing over which the performance obligations are satisfied with respect to these products.\nTo test the Company’s judgments and conclusions related to the identification of performance obligations and timing of satisfaction of those performance obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, obtaining an understanding of the Company’s AxiomSL and Calypso service offerings and evaluating management’s conclusions regarding which were distinct. We involved subject matter resources to assist in testing management’s identification of performance obligations and determining timing over which they are satisfied. We read a sample of executed contracts to assess management’s evaluation of significant terms, including the determination of distinct performance obligations.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\n \nWe have

When we do not have a controlling interest in an entity but exercise significant influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies, such investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. See “Equity Method Investments” within “Investments”\n \nbelow for further discussion\n.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.\nForeign Currency\nForeign denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and recorded through the income statement. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are remeasured using the rates on the dates on which those elements are recognized during the period, and are included in general, administrative and other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nF-10\nTranslation gains or losses resulting from translating our subsidiaries’ financial statements from the local functional currency to the reporting currency, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet date while revenues and expenses are translated at the date the transaction occurs or at an applicable average rate.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all non-restricted cash in banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Such equivalent investments included in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $\n373\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n122\n million as of December 31, 2023. Cash equivalents are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these investments.\n \nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents, which was $\n31\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n20\n million as of December 31, 2023, is restricted from withdrawal due to a contractual or regulatory requirement or not available for general use and as such is classified as restricted in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily includes funds held for regulatory capital for our trading and clearing businesses.\nDefault Funds and Margin Deposits\nNasdaq Clearing members’ cash contributions are included in default funds and margin deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a current asset and a current liability. These balances may fluctuate over time due to changes in the amount of deposits required and whether members choose to provide cash or non-cash contributions. Non-cash contributions include highly rated government debt securities that must meet specific criteria approved by Nasdaq Clearing. Non-cash contributions are pledged assets that are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Nasdaq Clearing does not take legal ownership of these assets and the risks and rewards remain with the clearing members.\nReceivables, net\nOur receivables are concentrated with our customers which primarily include corporate clients, banks, investment managers, brokers, and exchange operators. Receivables are shown net of allowance for credit losses. The allowance is maintained at a level that management believes to be sufficient to absorb expected losses over the life of our accounts receivable portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts, which is included in general, administrative and other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and decreased by the amount of charge-offs, net of recoveries. \nThe allowance is primarily based on an aging methodology. This method applies loss rates based on historical loss information which is disaggregated by business segment and, as deemed necessary, is adjusted for other factors and considerations that could impact collectibility.\n \nAdditionally, we consider corporate default rate averages over an extended period as compared to the period covered by our historical loss data and include an adjustment to historical loss percentages for current conditions and expected future conditions if necessary.\nIn circumstances where a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations is known (i.e., bankruptcy filings), we determine whether a specific provision for bad debts is required. Accounts receivable are written-off against the allowance when collection efforts cease. Due to changing economic, business and market conditions, we review the allowance quarterly and make changes to the allowance through the provision for bad debts as appropriate. If circumstances change (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to pay), our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount.\n The total allowance netted against receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $\n10\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n18\n million as of December 31, 2023. Any provision for bad debt or write-off recorded during the year was immaterial.\nInvestments\nPurchases and sales of investment securities are recognized on settlement date.\nFinancial Investments\nFinancial investments are comprised of trading securities bought principally to meet regulatory capital requirements mainly for our clearing operations at Nasdaq Clearing. These investments are classified as trading securities as they are generally sold in the near term, with changes in fair value included in other income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFair value is generally obtained from third-party pricing sources. When available, quoted market prices are used to determine fair value. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using pricing models with observable market inputs. The inputs to the valuation models vary by the type of security being priced but are typically benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, and prices of similar assets. Pricing models generally do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed use inputs observed from active markets. See “Fair Value Measurements” below for further discussion of fair value measures.\nF-11\nEquity Securities\nInvestments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values (other than those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are measured at fair value and any changes in fair value are recognized in other income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the measurement alternative, under which investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, \nplus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer on\n a prospective basis. \nWe assess relevant transactions that occur on or before the balance sheet date to identify observable price changes, and we regularly monitor these investments to evaluate whether there is an indication that the investment is impaired, based on t\nhe share price from the investee’s latest financing round\n, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets, the investee\n’\ns liquidity and cash positio\nn, and general market conditions. If a qualitative assessment indicates that the security is impaired, Nasdaq will estimate the fair value of the security and, if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the security, will recognize an impairment loss in net income equal to the difference in the period the impairment occurs. See Note 6, “Investments,” for further discussion of our equity securities.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, \nno\n material adjustments were made to the carrying value of our equity securities.\nOur investments in equity securities are included in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we intend to hold these investments for more than one year. \nEquity Method Investments\nIn general, the equity method of accounting is used when we own 20% to 50% of the outstanding voting stock of a company or when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of a company. We have certain investments in which we have determined that we have significant influence and as such account for the investments under the equity method of accounting. We record our estimated pro-rata share of earnings or losses each reporting period and record any dividends as a reduction in the investment balance. We evaluate our equity method investments for other-than-temporary declines in value by considering a variety of factors such as the earnings capacity of the investment and the fair value of the investment compared to its carrying amount. In addition, for investments where the market value is readily determinable, we consider the underlying stock price. If the estimated fair value of the investment is less than the carrying amount and management considers the decline in value to be other than temporary, the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value is recognized in net income in the period the impairment occurs. See Note 6, \n“Investments,” for further discussion of our equity method investments.\nNo\n material impairments were recorded to reduce the carrying value of our equity method investments in 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nNon-Designated Derivatives\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure of intercompany loans, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other balance sheet items. These contracts are not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. The change in fair value of these contracts is recognized in general, administrative and other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and offsets the foreign currency exposure.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of our derivative instruments were immaterial.\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges\nWe enter into foreign currency contracts and designate them as cash flow hedges to manage forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses. To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on the hedged transactions. The change in fair value of these contracts is recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency revenue or foreign currency expense to revenue or operating expense, as applicable.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were immaterial. \nNet Investment Hedges\nNet assets of our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We may utilize net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment arising from re-measuring our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nOur Euro Notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. Any increase or decrease related to the remeasurement of these notes into U.S. dollars is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n See “Net Investment Hedge” of Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” for further discussion.\nF-12\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less asset impairment charges and accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from \n10\n to \n40\n years for buildings and improvements, \n3\n to \n5\n years for data processing equipment, and \n5\n to \n10\n years for furniture and equipment.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the related lease.\nWe develop systems solutions for both internal and external use. Certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software are capitalized. In addition, certain costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as a separate product or as part of a product or process are capitalized beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detailed program design or, in its absence, completion. Prior to reaching technological feasibility, all costs are charged to expense. Unamortized capitalized costs are included in data processing equipment and software, within property and equipment, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally \n5\n to \n10\n years. Amortization of these costs is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nImplementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract are capitalized as a prepaid asset, primarily included in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are amortized over the expected service period in the relevant expense category in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nProperty and equipment are subject to impairment testing when events or conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For internal use software, an impairment charge is recognized when the carrying amount of the internal use software exceeds its fair value and is not recoverable. For software to be sold, leased, or marketed, the carrying amount of the software is compared to its net realizable value, which represents the estimated future gross revenues from that product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product. The amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the net realizable value shall be written off. Any required impairment loss is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to operating results.\nSee Note 7, “Property and Equipment, net,” for further discussion.\nLeases\nAt inception, we determine whether a contract is or contains a lease. W\ne have operating leases which are primarily real estate leases for our U.S. and European headquarters and for general office space.\n As of December 31, 2024, t\nhese leases have varying lease terms with remaining maturities ranging up to \n12\n years. Operating lease balances are included in operating lease assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any leases classified as finance leases. \nOperating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when we are reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation based on an index or rate. These payments are included in the initial measurement of the operating lease liability and operating lease asset. However, rental payments that are based on a change in an index or a rate are considered variable lease payments and are expensed as incurred.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single performance obligation \nto the extent that the timing and pattern of transfer are similar for the lease and non-lease components and the lease component qualifies as an operating lease\n. We do not recognize lease liabilities and operating lease assets for leases with a term of 12 months or less. We recognize these lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nWe review our operating lease assets for potential impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We fully impair our lease assets for locations that we vacate with no intention to sublease.\n \nSee Note 16, “Leases,” for further discussion.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, of a business acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, technology, exchange and clearing registrations, trade names and licenses when a \nF-13\nspecific right or contract is acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily exchange and clearing registrations, are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually as of October 1 and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount, such as changes in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. When testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than their respective carrying amounts as the basis to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit or the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds their respective estimated fair values, a quantitative test is required. \nIn performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset with their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amounts of the reporting unit or the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceed their respective fair values, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the difference, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit or the total carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nThere was \nno\n impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Future disruptions to our business and events, such as prolonged economic weakness or unexpected significant declines in operating results of any of our reporting units or businesses, may result in goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the future.\nOther Long-Lived Assets\nWe review our other long-lived assets, such as finite-lived intangible assets, property and equipment and operating lease assets, for potential impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Fair value of finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment is based on various valuation techniques. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to operating results.\n We fully impair our lease assets for locations that we vacate with no intention to sublease. \nThere were \nno\n material finite-lived intangible assets impairment charges in 2\n024, 2023 and 2022.\n We recorded pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment asset impairment charges, primarily in relation to our restructuring programs of $\n37\n million in 2024, $\n12\n million in 2023, and $\n8\n million in 2022. See Note 20, “Restructuring Charges,” for further discussion. There were no material operating lease assets impairments in 2024 and 2022. As a result of the review of our real estate and facility capacity requirements, for the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of $\n23\n million, of which $\n13\n million related to operating lease asset impairment. See Note 16, “Leases,” for further discussion. \nRevenue Recognition and Transaction-Based Expenses\nRevenue From Contracts With Customers\nOur revenue recognition policies under FASB ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” or Topic 606, are described in the following paragraphs.\nContract Balances\nSubstantially all of our revenues are considered to be revenues from contracts with customers. The related accounts receivable balances are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables which are net of an allowance for credit losses. We do not have obligations for warranties, returns or refunds to customers.\nThe majority of our contracts with customers do not have significant variable consideration. We do not have a material amount of revenues recognized from performance obligations that were satisfied in prior periods. We do not provide disclosures about transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations if contract durations are less than one year. \nFor contract durations that are one-year or greater, the portion of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations is included in Note 3, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers.” Our deferred revenue primarily arises from contract liabilities related to our fees for annual and initial listings, workflow & insights, financial crime management technology, regulatory technology, and capital markets technology contracts. Deferred revenue is the only significant contract asset or liability as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. See Note 8, “Deferred Revenue,” for our discussion of deferred revenue balances, activity, and expected timing of recognition. See “Revenue Recognition” below for further descriptions of our revenue contracts.\nF-14\nS\nales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit that we have determined to be the contract term or estimated service period. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of deferred costs and related amortization expense are not material to our consolidated financial statements. Sales commissions are expensed when incurred if contract durations are one year or less. Sales taxes are excluded from transaction prices.\nCertain judgments and estimates were used in the identification and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and the related allocation of transaction price and are discussed below. We believe that these represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to our customers.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur primary revenue contract classifications are described below. Revenues are categorized based on similar economic characteristics of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows.\nCapital Access Platforms\nData and Listings\nData revenues are earned from U.S. and European proprietary data products. We earn revenues primarily based on the number of data subscribers and distributors of our data. Data revenues are subscription-based and are recognized on a monthly basis. \nListing services revenues primarily include initial listing fees and annual renewal fees. Under Topic 606, the initial listing fee is allocated to multiple performance obligations including initial and subsequent listing services and corporate solutions products (when a company qualifies to receive certain complimentary IPO products under the applicable Nasdaq rule), as well as a customer’s material right to renew the option to list on our exchanges. In performing this allocation, the standalone selling price of the performance obligations is based on the initial and annual listing fees and the standalone selling price of the IPO complimentary services is based on its market value. All listing fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the listing service. The amount of revenue related to the IPO complimentary services performance obligation is recognized ratably over a \nthree-year\n period, which is based on contract terms, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over \nsix years\n which is based on our historical listing experience and projected future listing duration.\nIn the U.S., annual renewal fees are charged to listed companies based on their number of outstanding shares at the end of the prior year and are recognized ratably over the following \ntwelve-month\n period since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service. Annual fees are charged to newly listed companies on a pro-rata basis, based on outstanding shares at the time of listing and recognized over the remainder of the year. European annual renewal fees, which are received from companies listed on our Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic exchanges and Nasdaq First North, are directly related to the listed companies’ market capitalization on a trailing \ntwelve-month\n basis and are recognized ratably over the following \ntwelve-month\n period since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service.\nIndex\nWe develop and license Nasdaq-branded indices and financial products and provide index data products for third-party clients. Revenues primarily include license fees from these branded indices and financial products in the U.S. and abroad. We primarily have \ntwo\n types of license agreements: asset-based licenses and transaction-based licenses. Customers are charged based on a percentage of AUM for licensed products, per the agreement, on a monthly or quarterly basis. These revenues are recognized over the term of the license agreement since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service. Revenue from index data subscriptions are recognized on a monthly basis. Customers are charged based on transaction volume or a minimum contract amount, or both. If a customer is charged based on transaction volume, we recognize revenue when the transaction occurs. If a customer is charged based on a minimum contract amount, we recognize revenue on a pro-rata basis over the licensing term since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service. \nWorkflow & Insights\nWorkflow & Insights includes our analytics and corporate solutions products.\nAnalytics\n revenues are earned from investment content and analytics products. We earn revenues primarily based on the number of content and analytics subscribers and distributors.\nSubscription agreements are generally \none\n to \nthree years\n in term, payable in advance, and provide for automatic renewal. Subscription-based revenues are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract period beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service.\nOur corporate solutions business includes our Investor Relations Intelligence, Governance Solutions and Sustainability Solutions products, which serve both public and private companies and organizations.\nF-15\nCorporate solutions revenues primarily include subscription and transaction-based income from our investor relations intelligence and governance solutions products and services. Subscription-based revenues earned are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract period beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service. Generally, fees are billed in advance and the contract provides for automatic renewal. As part of subscription agreements, customers can also be charged usage fees based upon actual usage of the services provided. Revenues from usage fees are recognized at a point in time when the service is provided.\nFinancial Technology\nFinancial Crime Management Technology\nOur financial crime management technology business, which includes our Nasdaq Verafin solution, primarily consists of SaaS revenues. We enter into subscription agreements which allow customers access to our cloud platform. Subscription agreements are generally \nthree years\n in term, payable in advance, with the option of automatic renewal for some products. Subscription-based revenues are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract period beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service.\nRegulatory Technology\nRegulatory Technology includes AxiomSL and surveillance solutions.\nAxiomSL solutions\nAxiomSL provides financial institutions with risk & financial regulatory reporting and risk management solutions. The products can be offered as an on-premises or as a cloud service agreement. \nThe AxiomSL on-premises software offering includes license and PCS, which includes frequent and ongoing mandatory regulatory updates. Historically, the license and the PCS were considered distinct performance obligations, with license revenue recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer, and support is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract period beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. During the third quarter of 2024, as part of finalizing the purchase accounting of the Adenza acquisition, and based on new information obtained on the frequent and ongoing mandatory regulatory updates to AxiomSL's regulatory reporting software, which are critical to the utility and value of the product for the client, we noted that the software license and PCS constitute a single, combined performance obligation and would be recognized ratably over the contract term. See Note 3, “Revenue from contracts with customers,” for further discussion. \nAxiomSL can also be offered as a cloud service whereby the software is hosted and managed for customers. These hosted agreements generally include a license, hosting services and maintenance services. We have determined that these services are not distinct in the context of the hosting arrangement as the customer cannot benefit from the license or maintenance without the hosting services. Cloud revenues are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract period beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service.\nSurveillance \nOur surveillance solutions are primarily SaaS based. We enter into subscription agreements which allow customers access to our cloud platform or a connection to our servers to access the software. We recognize revenue from these agreements over time on a ratable basis over the contract period beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service.\nCapital Markets Technology\nCapital Markets Technology includes our Calypso and market technology solutions as well as trade management services.\nCalypso solutions\nOur Calypso product offering includes on-premises and cloud service agreements. We recognize revenue from cloud service agreements similar to our revenue recognition for the AxiomSL agreements discussed above. \nFor our on-premises offering, a license provides customers with the right to use the software at its current state at the time it is made available to the customer. These contracts generally consist of the following distinct performance obligations: license and PCS. In allocating the contractual price to each performance obligation, we have used our best estimate of the stand-alone selling price. Consideration is first allocated to performance obligations with established stand-alone selling prices based on observable evidence.\nLicense revenue is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer as this is the point the user of the software can direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the software license. PCS revenue is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract period beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service.\nF-16\nProfessional services, offered for our Calypso and market technology customers, are typically billed on a time and expense basis and revenue is recognized based on actual hours incurred. Nasdaq also offers fixed price contract agreements where revenue is recognized using the input method to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the services, because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company.\nMarket technology solutions\nOur market technology revenues primarily consist of software, license and support revenues, SaaS revenues, and change request revenues.\nWe enter into long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license the right to use software, and provide support and other services to our customers. We also enter into agreements to modify the system solutions sold by Nasdaq after delivery has occurred. In addition, we enter into subscription agreements which allow customers to connect to our servers to access our software.\nOur long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license the right to use software and provide support and other services to our customers have multiple performance obligations. The performance obligations are generally: (i) software license and installation service and (ii) software support. We have determined that the software license and installation service are not distinct as the license and the customized installation service are inputs to produce the combined output, a functional and integrated software system.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. In instances where standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the standalone selling price predominantly through an expected cost plus a margin approach. Revenues related to the market technology contracts described above represented \n5.8\n%, \n11.3\n% and \n13.4\n% of total Capital Markets Technology revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nContract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are for goods and services that are not distinct, and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.\nFor our long-term contracts, payments are generally made throughout the contract life and can be dependent on either reaching certain milestones or paid upfront in advance of the service period depending on the stage of the contract. For subscription agreements, contract payment terms can be quarterly, annually or monthly, in advance. For all other contracts, payment terms vary.\nWe generally recognize revenue over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by our performance because our customer controls the asset for which we are creating, our performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and we have a right to payment for performance completed to date. For these services, we recognize revenue over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs generally include labor and direct overhead. For software support and update services, and for subscription agreements which allow customers to connect to our servers to access our software, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the service period beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit consistently over the period as Nasdaq provides the services.\nAccounting for our long-term contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for schedule and technical issues, productivity, and the complexity of work performed. When adjustments in estimated total contract costs are required, any changes in the estimated revenues from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the effect of such change. If estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. \nMarket Technology SaaS revenues are recognized similar to our AxiomSL and Calypso solutions.\nTrade management services\nThrough our trade management services, we provide market participants with a wide variety of alternatives for connecting to and accessing our markets for a fee. We also offer market participants colocation services, whereby we charge firms for cabinet space and power to house their own equipment and servers within our data centers. These participants are charged monthly fees for cabinet space, connectivity and support in accordance with our published fee schedules. These fees are recognized on a monthly basis when the performance obligation is met. We also earn revenues from annual and monthly exchange membership and registration fees. Revenues for monthly exchange membership and registration fees are recognized on a monthly basis as the service is provided. Revenues from annual fees for exchange membership and registration fees are recognized ratably over \nF-17\nthe following \ntwelve-month\n period since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service.\nMarket Services\nTransaction-Based Trading and Clearing\nTransaction-based trading and clearing includes equity derivative trading and clearing, cash equity trading and FICC revenues. Nasdaq charges transaction fees for trades executed on our exchanges, as well as on orders that are routed to and executed on other market venues. Nasdaq charges clearing fees for contracts cleared with Nasdaq Clearing.\nIn the U.S., transaction fees are based on trading volumes for trades executed on our U.S. exchanges and in Europe, transaction fees are based on the volume and value of traded and cleared contracts. In Canada, transaction fees are based on trading volumes for trades executed on our Canadian exchange.\nNasdaq satisfies its performance obligation for trading services upon the execution of a customer trade and clearing services when a contract is cleared, as trading and clearing transactions are substantially complete when they are executed and we have no further obligation to the customer at that time. Transaction-based trading and clearing fees can be variable and are based on trade volume tiered discounts. Transaction revenues, as well as any tiered volume discounts, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules. In the U.S., we also pay liquidity payments to customers based on our published fee schedules. We use these payments to improve the liquidity on our markets and therefore recognize those payments as a cost of revenue.\nFor U.S. equity derivative trading, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that provides the liquidity. For U.S. and Canadian cash equity trading, including for The Nasdaq Stock Market, Nasdaq PSX and Nasdaq CXC, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that provides the liquidity, and for Nasdaq BX and Nasdaq CX2, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that takes the liquidity. We record these credits as transaction rebates that are included in transaction-based expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These transaction rebates are paid on a monthly basis and the amounts due are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn the U.S., we pay Section 31 fees to the SEC for supervision and regulation of securities markets. We pass these costs along to our customers through our equity derivative trading and clearing fees and our cash equity trading fees. We collect the fees as a pass-through charge from organizations executing eligible trades on our options exchanges and our cash equity platforms and we recognize these amounts in transaction-based expenses when incurred. Section 31 fees received are included in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of \nreceipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as Section 31 fees payable to the SEC in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until paid. Since the amount recorded as revenues is equal to the amount recorded as transaction-based expenses, there is no impact on our revenues less transaction-based expenses. As we hold the cash received until payment to the SEC, we earn interest income on the related cash balances.\nUnder our Limitation of Liability Rule and procedures, we may, subject to certain caps, provide compensation for losses directly resulting from our systems’ actual failure to correctly process an order, quote, message or other data into our platform. We do not record a liability for any potential claims that may be submitted under the Limitation of Liability Rule unless they meet the provisions required in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As such, losses arising as a result of the rule are accrued and charged to expense only if the loss is probable and estimable.\nU.S. Tape Plans\nFor U.S. Tape plans, revenues are collected monthly based on published fee schedules and distributed quarterly to the U.S. exchanges based on a formula required by Regulation NMS that takes into account both trading and quoting activity. These revenues are presented on a net basis as all indicators of principal versus agent reporting under U.S. GAAP have been considered in analyzing the appropriate presentation of the revenue sharing. The following are primary indicators of net reporting:\n•\nWe are the administrator for the UTP plan, in addition to being a participant in the plan. In our unique role as administrator, we facilitate the collection and dissemination of revenues on behalf of the plan participants. As a participant, we share in the net distribution of revenues according to the plan on the same terms as all other plan participants.\n•\nThe operating committee of the plan, which comprises representatives from each of the participants, including us solely in our capacity as a plan participant, is responsible for setting the level of fees to be paid by distributors and subscribers and taking action in accordance with the provisions of the plan, subject to SEC approval.\n•\nRisk of loss on the revenue is shared equally among plan participants according to the plan.\nF-18\nOther Revenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Other revenues include revenues related to our Nordic power derivatives trading and clearing business, see “Market Services” of Note 1, “Organization and Nature of Operations,” for further discussion. In June 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell our Nordic power trading and clearing business, which was subsequently terminated in June 2024. In January 2025, we entered into a new agreement to transfer existing open positions in our Nordic power derivatives trading and clearing business to a European exchange. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals. Revenues from this business will continue to be reflected in Other revenues. Prior to June 2023, these revenues were included in our Market Services and Capital Access Platforms segments. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Other revenues also include a transitional services agreement associated with a divested business. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Other revenues also include revenues related to our Nordic broker services business for which we completed the wind-down in June 2022. Prior to June 2022, these revenues were included in our Market Services and Capital Access Platforms segments.\n \nEarnings Per Share\nWe present both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Nasdaq by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Nasdaq by the weighted-average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period and reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities, which primarily consist of restricted stock, PSUs, and employee stock options. Common share equivalents are excluded from the computation in periods for which they have an anti-dilutive effect. Stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period are anti-dilutive and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation. Shares which are considered contingently issuable are included in the computation of dilutive earnings per share on a weighted average basis when management determines the applicable performance criteria would have been met if the performance period ended as of the date of the relevant computation.\n See Note 13, “Earnings Per Share,” for further discussion.\nPension, SERP and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nIn June 2023, we terminated our U.S. pension plan and took steps to wind down the plan and transfer the resulting liability to an insurance company. This process was completed in 2024. See Note 10, “Retirement Plans,” for further discussion.\nWe maintain nonqualified SERPs for certain senior executives and other post-retirement benefit plans for eligible employees in the U.S. Most employees outside the U.S. are covered by local retirement plans or by applicable social laws. Benefits under social laws are generally expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. \nThe nonqualified SERPs and other post-retirement benefit plans are measured using actuarial valuations. Actuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We assess our nonqualified SERPs and other post-retirement benefit plan assumptions on an annual basis. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including evaluation of the discount rate, which is modified to reflect the prevailing market rates at the measurement date of a high-quality fixed-income debt instrument portfolio that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefit obligations as they come due. Actuarial assumptions are based upon management’s best estimates and judgment. See Note 10, “Retirement Plans,” for further discussion.\nShare-Based Compensation\nNasdaq uses the fair value method of accounting for share-based awards. Share-based awards, or equity awards, include restricted stock, PSUs, and stock options. The fair value of restricted stock awards and PSUs, other than PSUs granted with market conditions, is determined based on the grant date closing stock price less the present value of future cash dividends. We estimate the fair value of PSUs granted with market conditions using a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of grant. The fair value of stock options are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nWe generally recognize compensation expense for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, taking into account an estimated forfeiture rate. Granted but unvested shares are generally forfeited upon termination of employment.\nExcess tax benefits or expense related to employee share-based payments, if any, are recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income when the awards vest or are settled.\nNasdaq also has an ESPP that allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of our common stock at \nsix-month\n intervals, called offering periods, at \n85.0\n% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each offering period. The \n15.0\n% discount given to our employees is included in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nF-19\nSee Note 11, “Share-Based Compensation,” for further discussion.\nMerger and Strategic Initiatives\nWe incur incremental direct merger and strategic initiative costs relating to various completed and potential acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic opportunities. These costs generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third-party transaction costs and are expensed as incurred.\n \nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or the exit price, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Fair value measurement establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect Nasdaq’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\n•\nLevel 1:\n Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2:\n Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\n•\nLevel 3:\n Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.\nThis hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.\nSee Note 14, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” for further discussion.\nTax Matters\nWe use the asset and liability method to determine income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets (net of valuation allowances) and deferred tax liabilities are presented net by jurisdiction as either a non-current asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities (i.e., temporary differences) and are measured at the enacted rates that will be in effect when these differences are realized. If necessary, a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nIn order to recognize and measure our unrecognized tax benefits, management determines whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the recognition thresholds, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in income tax expense.\nSubsequent Events\nWe have evaluated subsequent events through the issuance date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nRecent Accounting Developments\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” ASU 2023-09 enhances income tax disclosure requirements by requiring public entities to provide additional information in its tax rate reconciliation and additional disclosures about income taxes paid. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. This update should be applied prospectively, but entities have the option to apply it retrospectively. The adoption of this standard only impacts disclosures and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nF-20\n3. \nREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following tables summarize the disaggregation of revenue by major product and service and by segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nCapital Access Platforms\nData & Listing Services\n$\n754\n \n$\n749\n \n$\n727\n \nIndex\n706\n \n528\n \n486\n \nWorkflow & Insights\n512\n \n493\n \n469\n \nFinancial Technology\nFinancial Crime Management Technology\n273\n \n223\n \n176\n \nRegulatory Technology\n352\n \n212\n \n130\n \nCapital Markets Technology\n996\n \n664\n \n558\n \nMarket Services, net\n1,020\n \n987\n \n988\n \nOther revenues\n36\n \n39\n \n48\n \nRevenues less transaction-based expenses\n$\n4,649\n \n$\n3,895\n \n$\n3,582\n \nSubstantially all revenues from the Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology segments were recognized over time \nfor the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately \n95.3\n%, \n93.0\n% and \n93.2\n%, respectively, of Market Services revenues were recognized at a point in time and \n4.7\n%, \n7.0\n% and \n6.8\n%, respectively, were recognized over time.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, as part of finalizing the purchase accounting of the Adenza acquisition, we implemented a change to the accounting treatment of the revenues associated with AxiomSL on-premises subscription contracts, which are included in the Regulatory Technology business within the Financial Technology segment. Starting in the third quarter of 2024, we began recognizing AxiomSL’s subscription-based revenues on a ratable basis over the contract term. The change reflects new information obtained on the frequent and ongoing mandatory updates to AxiomSL's regulatory reporting software, which are critical to the utility and value of the product for the client. As a result of this change, we recognized a one-time revenue reduction of $\n32\n million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting the net impact of the accounting change since the date of the Adenza acquisition. \nSee Note 4, “Acquisition,” for further discussion on the measurement period adjustment.\nContract Balances\nS\nubstantially all of our revenues are considered to be revenues from contracts with customers. The related accounts receivable balances are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables, which are net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n10\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n18\n million as of December 31, 2023. There were no material upward or downward adjustments to the allowance during the year ended December 31, 2024. We do not have obligations for warranties, returns or refunds to customers.\nDeferred revenue is the only significant contract asset or liability as of December 31, 2024. Deferred revenue represents consideration received that is yet to be recognized as revenue for unsatisfied performance obligations. See Note 8, “Deferred Revenue,” for our discussion on deferred revenue balances, activity, and expected timing of recognition.\nWe do not provide disclosures about the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations if contract durations are less than one year. For our initial listings, the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is included in deferred revenue, and therefore not included below. For our Financial Crime Management Technology, Regulatory Technology, Capital Markets Technology and Workflow & Insights contracts, the portion of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations is presented in the table below. The timing in the table below is based on our best estimates as, for certain contracts, the recognition is primarily dependent upon the completion of customization and any significant modifications made pursuant to existing contracts.

Nasdaq issued approximately $\n5.0\n billion of debt, and entered into a $\n600\n million term loan, and used the proceeds for the cash portion of the consideration. See “Senior Unsecured Notes” and “2023 Term Loan” in “Financing of the Adenza Acquisition” of Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” for further discussion. \nOn November 1, 2023, Nasdaq completed the acquisition of Adenza for a total purchase consideration of $\n9,984\n million, which comprises the following: \n(in millions, except price per share)\nShares of Nasdaq common stock issued\n85.6\n \nClosing price per share of Nasdaq common stock on November 1, 2023\n$\n48.71\n \nFair value of equity portion of the purchase consideration\n$\n4,170\n \nCash consideration\n$\n5,814\n \nTotal purchase consideration\n$\n9,984\n \nAt the closing of the transaction, the \n85.6\n million shares of Nasdaq common stock were issued to Thoma Bravo, the sole shareholder of Adenza, and represented approximately \n15\n% of the outstanding shares of Nasdaq. For further discussion on the rights of common stockholders refer to “Common Stock” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders’ Equity.” This acquisition is part of our Financial Technology segment. \nOn July 26, 2024, Nasdaq announced a secondary public offering of \n41.6\n million shares of our common stock held by Thoma Bravo, which was offered to the public at $\n65.30\n per share. Nasdaq did not receive any proceeds from this offering of the shares held by Thoma Bravo. Concurrently, Nasdaq entered into a share repurchase agreement with Thoma Bravo and repurchased \n1.2\n million shares of our common stock from this offering. Nasdaq used cash on hand and borrowings under our commercial paper program to fund the share repurchase amount of $\n77\n million. At the completion of these transactions, Thoma Bravo held \n42.8\n million shares of Nasdaq common stock, representing approximately \n7.4\n% of the outstanding shares of Nasdaq.\nThe amounts in the table below represent the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the acquired intangible assets, the deferred tax liability on the acquired intangible assets and other assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their preliminary respective estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. \nThe excess purchase price over the net tangible and acquired intangible assets has been recorded as goodwill. The goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to expected synergies and is assigned to our Financial Technology segment.\n(in millions)\nGoodwill\n$\n5,933\n \nAcquired intangible assets\n5,050\n \nReceivables, net\n236\n \nOther net assets acquired\n153\n \nCash and cash equivalents\n48\n \nAccrued personnel costs\n(\n44\n)\nDeferred revenue\n(\n130\n)\nDeferred tax liability on acquired intangible assets\n(\n1,262\n)\nTotal purchase consideration\n$\n9,984\n \nIn the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a purchase accounting adjustment to the estimated purchase price allocation shown above and disclosed as of December 31, 2023. This adjustment relates to the impact of the change from upfront to ratable revenue recognition for AxiomSL on-premises contracts entered into prior to the acquisition date, as described above, and decreased accrued income (which reflects revenue earned but not yet billed and included in receivables above) by $\n46\n million, increased deferred revenue by $\n56\n million and increased goodwill by $\n77\n million, net of a deferred tax asset of $\n25\n million. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we finalized the purchase accounting for this acquisition.\nIntangible Assets\nThe following table presents the details of acquired intangible assets at the date of acquisition. Acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method. \nCustomer \nRelationships\nTechnology\nTrade \nNames\nTotal Acquired Intangible \nAssets\nIntangible asset value (in millions)\n$\n3,740\n \n$\n950\n \n$\n360\n \n$\n5,050\n \nDiscount rate used\n9.5\n \n%\n8.5\n \n%\n8.5\n \n%\nEstimated average useful life\n22\n years\n6\n years\n20\n years\nCustomer Relationships\nCustomer relationships represent the contractual relationships with customers. \nMethodology\n \nCustomer relationships were valued using the income approach, specifically an excess earnings method. The excess earnings method examines the economic returns contributed by the identified tangible and intangible assets of a company, and then isolates the excess return that is attributable to the intangible asset being valued.\nF-22\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate used reflects the amount of risk associated with the hypothetical cash flows for the customer relationships relative to the overall business. In developing a discount rate for the customer relationships, we estimated a weighted-average cost of capital for the overall business and we utilized this rate as an input when discounting the cash flows. The resulting discounted cash flows were then tax-effected at the applicable statutory rate.\nA discounted tax amortization benefit was added to the fair value of the assets under the assumption that the customer relationships would be amortized for tax purposes over a period of \n15\n years.\nTechnology \nAs part of our acquisition of Adenza, we acquired developed technology relating to AxiomSL and Calypso. \nMethodology\nThe developed technology was valued using the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method, which is used to estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset who would otherwise have to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. The royalty rate is applied to the projected revenue over the expected remaining life of the intangible asset to estimate royalty savings. The net after-tax royalty savings are calculated for each year in the remaining economic life of the technology and discounted to present value.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate used reflects the amount of risk associated with the hypothetical cash flows for the developed technology relative to the overall business as discussed above in “Customer Relationships.”\nTrade Names\nAs part of our acquisition of Adenza, we acquired the AxiomSL and Calypso trade names. The trade names are recognized in the industry and carry a reputation for quality. As such, the reputation and positive recognition embodied in the trade names is a valuable asset to Nasdaq.\nMethodology\nThe AxiomSL and Calypso trade names were valued using the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method as discussed above in “Technology.”\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate used reflects the amount of risk associated with the hypothetical cash flows for the trade names relative to the overall business as discussed above in “Customer Relationships.”\nPro Forma Results and Acquisition-Related Costs\nFrom the date of acquisition through December 31, 2023, Adenza revenues of $\n149\n million were included in Financial Technology revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Adenza operating income of $\n55\n million was included in our operating income in the Consolidated Statement of Income\n.\nAcquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and are included in merger and strategic initiatives expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nSupplemental Pro Forma Information (Unaudited)\nThe unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information presented below is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the acquisition had been completed on the date indicated, does not reflect synergies that might have been achieved, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. \nThe following supplemental pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations as if Adenza had been acquired as of January 1, 2022. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These adjustments primarily include a net increase in amortization expense that would have been recognized due to acquired identifiable intangible assets, a net increase to interest expense to reflect the additional borrowings for the financing of the Adenza acquisition net of the interest expense relating to the repayment of Adenza’s historical debt, and the related income tax effects of the adjustments noted above.\nThe unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information for the periods presented is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nPro forma revenues less transaction-based expenses\n$\n4,329\n \n$\n4,096\n \nPro forma operating income\n1,485\n \n1,476\n \nPro forma net income attributable to Nasdaq\n822\n \n812\n \nF-23\n5. \nGOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nThe following table presents the changes in goodwill by business segment during the year ended December 31, 2024:\n(in millions)\nCapital Access Platforms\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n4,214\n \nForeign currency translation adjustments\n(\n87\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n4,127\n \nFinancial Technology\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n7,873\n \nMeasurement period adjustment\n77\n \nForeign currency translation adjustments\n(\n25\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n7,925\n \nMarket Services\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n2,025\n \nForeign currency translation adjustments\n(\n120\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n1,905\n \nTotal\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n14,112\n \nMeasurement period adjustments\n77\n \nForeign currency translation adjustments\n(\n232\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n13,957\n \nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, of a business acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amount may be impaired, such as changes in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. There was \nno\n impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022; however, events such as prolonged economic weakness or unexpected significant declines in operating results of any of our reporting units or businesses may result in goodwill impairment charges in the future.

Euro Notes are denominated in Euro. Additionally, the 2025 Notes were reclassified to short-term debt as of December 31, 2024, including the balance as of December 31, 2023, for presentation purposes.\nCommercial Paper Program\nOur U.S. dollar commercial paper program is supported by our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, which provides liquidity support for the repayment of commercial paper issued through this program. See “2022 Revolving Credit Facility” below for further discussion. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances fluctuates as short-term interest rates and demand fluctuate. The fluctuation of these rates may impact our interest expense.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOur 2040 Notes were issued at par. All of our other outstanding senior unsecured notes were issued at a discount. As a result of the discount, the proceeds received from each issuance were less than the aggregate principal amount. As of December 31, 2024, the amounts in the table above reflect the aggregate principal amount, which is net of discount and debt issuance costs, which are being accreted and amortized through interest expense over the life of the applicable notes. The accretion of the discount and amortization of the debt issuance costs was $\n13\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our Euro Notes are adjusted for the impact of foreign currency translation. Our senior unsecured notes are general unsecured obligations which rank equally with all of our existing and future unsubordinated obligations and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. The senior unsecured notes were issued under indentures that, among other things, limit our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, create liens, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. The senior unsecured notes may be redeemed by Nasdaq at any time, subject to a make-whole amount. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we repurchased an aggregate amount of $\n181\n million of outstanding notes, primarily related to the 2025 Notes, 2028 Notes, and 2034 Notes.\nUpon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the various supplemental indentures governing the applicable notes), the terms require us to repurchase all or part of each holder’s notes for cash equal to \n101\n% of the aggregate principal amount purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if\n any. \nThe Euro Notes pay interest annually. All other notes pay interest semi-annually. The U.S. dollar senior unsecured notes coupon rates may vary with Nasdaq’s debt rating, to the extent Nasdaq is downgraded below investment grade, up to an upward rate adjustment not to exceed \n2\n%. \nNet Investment Hedge\nOur Euro Notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. Our Euro denominated notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. Accordingly, the remeasurement of these notes is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the impact of translation decreased the U.S. dollar value of our Euro denominated notes by $\n175\n million.\nF-27\nFinancing of the Adenza Acquisition\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nIn June 2023, Nasdaq issued \nsix\n series of notes for total proceeds of $\n5,016\n million, net of debt issuance costs of $\n38\n million, with various maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2063. The net proceeds from these notes were used to finance the majority of the cash consideration due in connection with the Adenza acquisition. For further discussion of the Adenza acquisition, see Note 4, “Acquisition.”\n2023 Term Loan\nIn June 2023, in connection with the financing of the Adenza acquisition, we entered into a term loan credit agreement, or the 2023 Term Loan. The 2023 Term Loan provided us with the ability to borrow up to $\n600\n million to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Adenza acquisition, for repayment of certain debt of Adenza and its subsidiaries, and to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the transaction. On November 1, 2023, we borrowed $\n599\n million, net of fees, under this term loan towards payment of the cash consideration due in connection with the Adenza acquisition, a portion of which had been repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023. The term loan was fully repaid in 2024.\nCredit Facilities\n2022 Revolving Credit Facility\nIn December 2022, Nasdaq amended and restated its previously issued $\n1.25\n billion \nfive-year\n revolving credit facility, with a new maturity date of December 16, 2027. Nasdaq intends to use funds available under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes and to provide liquidity support for the repayment of commercial paper issued through the commercial paper program. Nasdaq is permitted to repay borrowings under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility at any time in whole or in part, without penalty.\nAs of December 31, 2024, \nno\n amounts were outstanding on the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility. The $(\n3\n) million balance represents unamortized debt issuance costs which are being amortized through interest expense over the life of the credit facility. \nBorrowings under the revolving credit facility and swingline borrowings bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at a variable interest rate based on either the SOFR (or a successor rate to SOFR), the base rate (as defined in the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility agreement), or other applicable rate with respect to non-dollar borrowings, plus an applicable margin that varies with Nasdaq’s debt rating. We are charged commitment fees of \n0.100\n% to \n0.250\n%, depending on our credit rating, whether or not amounts have been borrowed. These commitment fees are included in interest expense and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe 2022 Revolving Credit Facility contains financial and operating covenants. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio. Operating covenants include, among other things, limitations on Nasdaq’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on assets, dispose of assets and make certain restricted payments. The facility also contains customary affirmative covenants, including access to financial statements, notice of defaults and certain other material events, maintenance of properties and insurance, and customary events of default, including cross-defaults to our material indebtedness. \nThe 2022 Revolving Credit Facility includes an option for Nasdaq to increase the available aggregate amount by up to $\n750\n million, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions.\nOther Credit Facilities\nCertain of our European subsidiaries have several other credit facilities, which are available in multiple currencies, primarily to support our Nasdaq Clearing operations in Europe, as well as to provide a cash pool credit line. These credit facilities, in aggregate, totaled $\n174\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n191\n million as of December 31, 2023 in available liquidity, \nnone\n of which was utilized. Generally, these facilities each have a \none-year\n term. The amounts borrowed under these various credit facilities bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at a variable interest rate based on a base rate (as defined in the applicable credit agreement), plus an applicable margin. We are charged commitment fees (as defined in the applicable credit agreement), whether or not amounts have been borrowed. These commitment fees are included in interest expense and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThese facilities include customary affirmative and negative operating covenants and events of default.\nDebt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our debt obligations.\n10. \nRETIREMENT PLANS\nDefined Contribution Savings Plan\nWe sponsor a 401(k) plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution savings plan, for U.S. employees. Employees are immediately eligible to make contributions to the plan and are also eligible for an employer contribution match at an amount equal to \n100.0\n% of the first \n6.0\n% of eligible employee contributions. \nThe following table presents the savings plan expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, which is included in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income:\nF-28\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nSavings Plan expense\n$\n19\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n17\n \nPension, SERP and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nIn June 2023, we terminated our U.S. pension plan and took steps to wind down the plan and transfer the resulting liability to an insurance company. This process was completed in 2024. These steps included settling all future obligations under our U.S. pension plan through a combination of lump sum payments to eligible, electing participants (completed in 2023) and the transfer of any remaining benefits to a third-party insurance company through a group annuity contract. In connection with the plan termination and partial settlement, a pre-tax charge of $\n9\n million was recorded to compensation and benefits expense in 2023. We finalized the transfer of any remaining benefits during the first quarter of 2024 and recorded an additional settlement pre-tax charge of $\n23\n million to compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This was offset by a $\n19\n million adjustment to Other Comprehensive Income and a $\n4\n million cash settlement.\nWe continue to maintain nonqualified SERPs for certain senior executives and other post-retirement benefit plans for eligible employees in the U.S. Most employees outside the U.S. are covered by local retirement plans or by applicable social laws. Benefits under social laws are generally expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. \nThe total expense for these plans is included in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nRetirement Plans expense\n$\n54\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n24\n \nNonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan \nWe sponsor a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the Nasdaq, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan. This plan provides certain eligible employees with the opportunity to defer a portion of their annual salary and bonus up to certain approval limits. All deferrals and associated earnings are our general unsecured obligations and were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \n11. \nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe have a share-based compensation program for employees and non-employee directors. Share-based awards granted under this program include restricted stock (consisting of restricted stock units), PSUs and stock options. For accounting purposes, we consider PSUs to be a form of restricted stock. Generally, annual employee awards are granted on or about April 1\nst\n of each year. \nSummary of Share-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table presents the total share-based compensation expense resulting from equity awards and the \n15.0\n% discount for the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, which is included in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions)\nShare-based compensation expense before income taxes\n$\n141\n \n$\n122\n \n$\n106\n \nCommon Shares Available Under Our Equity Plan\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately \n22.9\n million shares of common stock authorized for future issuance under our Equity Plan.\nRestricted Stock\nWe grant restricted stock to most employees. The grant date fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing stock price at the date of grant less the present value of future cash dividends. Restricted stock awards granted to employees below the manager level generally vest \n33\n% on the first anniversary of the grant date, \n33\n% on the second anniversary of the grant date, and the remainder on the third anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock awards granted to employees at or above the manager level generally vest \n33\n% on the second anniversary of the grant date, \n33\n% on the third anniversary of the grant date, and the remainder on the fourth anniversary of the grant date.\nF-29\nThe following table summarizes our restricted stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nRestricted Stock\n \nNumber of Awards\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2021\n4,399,020\n \n$\n35.39\n \nGranted\n1,785,138\n \n57.65\n \nVested\n(\n1,525,442\n)\n31.22\n \nForfeited\n(\n278,203\n)\n42.07\n \nUnvested at December 31, 2022\n4,380,513\n \n45.48\n \nGranted\n1,850,790\n \n52.66\n \nVested\n(\n1,703,252\n)\n38.21\n \nForfeited\n(\n318,752\n)\n51.15\n \nUnvested at December 31, 2023\n4,209,299\n \n51.15\n \nGranted\n1,874,976\n \n60.16\n \nVested\n(\n1,614,071\n)\n47.48\n \nForfeited\n(\n291,337\n)\n55.57\n \nUnvested at December 31, 2024\n4,178,867\n \n$\n56.30\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n128\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n2.1\n years.\nPSUs\nWe grant \nthree-year\n PSUs to certain eligible employees. PSUs are based on performance measures that impact the amount of shares that each PSU eligible individual receives, subject to the satisfaction of applicable market performance conditions, with a \nthree-year\n cumulative performance period that vest at the end of the performance period and which settle in shares of our common stock. Compensation cost is recognized over the \nthree-year\n performance period, taking into account an estimated forfeiture rate, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service period has been completed. Performance will be determined by comparing Nasdaq’s TSR to \ntwo\n peer groups, each weighted \n50.0\n%. The first peer group consists of exchange companies, and the second peer group consists of all companies in the S&P 500. Beginning in 2024, we replaced the exchange company peer group with the S&P 500 GICS 4020 Index, which is a blend of exchanges, as well as data, financial technology and banking companies to align more closely with Nasdaq’s diverse business and competitors. Nasdaq’s relative performance ranking against each of these groups will determine the final number of shares delivered to each individual under the program. The award issuance under this program will be between \n0.0\n% and \n200.0\n% of the number of PSUs granted and will be determined by Nasdaq’s overall performance against both peer groups. However, if Nasdaq’s TSR is negative for the \nthree-year\n performance period, regardless of TSR ranking, the award issuance will not exceed \n100.0\n% of the number of \nPSUs granted. We estimate the fair value of PSUs granted under the \nthree-year\n PSU program using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as these awards contain a market condition. \nIn 2024, we also granted PSUs with a \ntwo-year\n performance period to certain eligible executives at the senior vice president level and above. These PSUs are based on performance measures relating to the implementation of certain integration actions in connection with the Adenza acquisition. Achievement of the targets impacts the amount of shares that each PSU eligible individual receives. The PSUs have a \ntwo-year\n performance period and will vest \none\n year after the end of the performance period, and settle in shares of our common stock. The award issuance under this program will be between \n0.0\n% and \n200.0\n% of the number of PSUs granted.\nGrants of PSUs that were issued in 2022 with a \nthree-year\n performance period exceeded the applicable performance metrics. As a result, an additional \n32,802\n units above the original aggregate target amount will be granted in the first quarter of 2025 and will be fully vested upon issuance.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the weighted-average fair values of the outstanding PSU awards granted under the \nthree-year\n PSU program during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n2024 Grants\n2023 Grant\nWeighted-average risk-free interest rate\n4.50\n \n%\n3.87\n \n%\nExpected volatility\n24.50\n \n%\n23.94\n \n%\nWeighted-average grant date share price\n$\n62.38\n \n$\n54.68\n \nWeighted-average fair value at grant date\n$\n78.67\n \n$\n55.36\n \nF-30\nThe following table summarizes our PSU activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nPSUs\nThree-Year Program\n \nNumber of Awards\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2021\n2,292,372\n \n \n$\n45.01\n \nGranted\n1,495,092\n \n45.66\n \nVested\n(\n1,735,842\n)\n32.57\n \nForfeited\n(\n85,080\n)\n52.27\n \nUnvested at December 31, 2022\n1,966,542\n \n \n$\n56.44\n \nGranted\n1,693,065\n \n47.14\n \nVested\n(\n1,552,311\n)\n37.59\n \nForfeited\n(\n98,974\n)\n57.51\n \nUnvested at December 31, 2023\n2,008,322\n \n$\n62.86\n \nGranted\n1,282,300\n \n73.91\n \nVested\n(\n961,331\n)\n73.14\n \nForfeited\n(\n155,140\n)\n62.80\n \nUnvested at December 31, 2024\n2,174,151\n \n$\n64.83\n \nIn the table above, in addition to the annual employee grant described above, the granted amount also includes additional awards granted based on overachievement of performance metrics. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to the PSU program is $\n65\n million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n1.5\n years. \nStock Options \nThere were \nno\n stock option awards granted for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. In January 2022, our Chief Executive Officer received an aggregate of \n613,872\n performance-based non-qualified stock options in connection with a new \nfive-year\n employment agreement.  \nThere were \nno\n stock options exercised for the \nyear\ns ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nA summary of our outstanding and exercisable stock options at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n \nNumber of Stock \nOptions\nWeighted-Average Exercise \nPrice\nWeighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm (in\nyears)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue (in\nmillions)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021\n806,451\n \n$\n22.23\n \nGranted\n613,872\n \n$\n67.49\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2022\n1,420,323\n \n$\n41.79\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n1,420,323\n \n$\n41.79\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n1,420,323\n \n$\n41.79\n \n4.2\n$\n50\n \nExercisable at December 31, 2024\n806,451\n \n$\n22.23\n \n2.0\n$\n44\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the aggregate pre-tax intrinsic value of the outstanding and exercisable stock options in the above table was $\n50\n million and represents the difference between our closing stock price on December 31, 2024 of $\n77.31\n and the exercise price, times the number of shares that would have been received by the option holder had the option holder exercised the stock options on that date. This amount can change based on the fair market value of our common stock. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, \n0.8\n million outstanding stock options were exercisable and the exercise price was $\n22.23\n. \nESPP\nWe have an ESPP under which approximately \n10.7\n million shares of our common stock were available for future issuance as of December 31, 2024. Under our ESPP, employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding \n10.0\n% of their annual compensation, subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Service limitations.

As of December 31, 2023, \n900,000,000\n shares of our common stock were authorized, \n598,014,520\n shares were issued and \n575,159,336\n shares were outstanding. The holders of common stock are entitled to \none\n vote per share, except that our certificate of incorporation limits the ability of any shareholder to vote in excess of \n5.0\n% of the then-outstanding shares of Nasdaq common stock.\nCommon Stock in Treasury, at Cost\nWe account for the purchase of treasury stock under the cost method with the shares of stock repurchased reflected as a reduction to Nasdaq stockholders’ equity and included in common stock in treasury, at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Shares repurchased under our share repurchase program are currently retired and canceled and are therefore not included in the common stock in treasury balance. If treasury shares are reissued, they are recorded at the average cost of the treasury shares acquired. We held \n23,858,161\n shares of common stock in treasury as of December 31, 2024 and \n22,855,184\n shares as of December 31, 2023, most of which are related to shares of our common stock withheld for the settlement of employee tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of restricted stock and PSUs. \nShare Repurchase Program\nAs of December 31, 2024, the remaining aggregate authorized amount under the existing share repurchase program was $\n1.7\n billion.\nThese repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchase techniques, an accelerated share repurchase program or otherwise, as determined by our management. The repurchases are primarily funded from existing cash balances. The share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and has no defined expiration date.\nThe following is a summary of our share repurchase activity, reported based on settlement date, for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nNumber of shares of common stock repurchased\n2,344,609\n \nAverage price paid per share \n$\n61.94\n \nTotal purchase price \n(in millions)\n$\n145\n \nIn the table above, the number of shares of common stock repurchased excludes an aggregate of \n1,002,977\n shares withheld to satisfy tax obligations of the grantee upon the vesting of restricted stock and PSUs, and these repurchases are excluded from our repurchase program. Shares repurchased pursuant to the stock repurchase agreement with Thoma Bravo executed in July 2024 are included in the table above. See Note 4, “Acquisition,” for further discussion.\nAs discussed above in “Common Stock in Treasury, at Cost,” shares repurchased under our share repurchase program are currently retired and cancelled.\nPreferred Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of \n30,000,000\n shares of preferred stock, par value $\n0.01\n per share, issuable from time to time in one or more series. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, \nno\n shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding.\nCash Dividends on Common Stock\nDuring 2024, our board of directors declared and paid the following cash dividends:\nDeclaration Date\nDividend Per\nCommon Share\nRecord Date\nTotal Amount Paid\nPayment Date\n \n \n \n(in millions)\n \nJanuary 29, 2024\n$\n0.22\n \nMarch 14, 2024\n$\n127\n \nMarch 28, 2024\nApril 24, 2024\n0.24\n \nJune 14, 2024\n138\n \nJune 28, 2024\nJuly 24, 2024\n0.24\n \nSeptember 13, 2024\n138\n \nSeptember 27, 2024\nOctober 22, 2024\n0.24\n \nDecember 6, 2024\n138\n \nDecember 20, 2024\n$\n541\n \nThe total amount paid of $\n541\n million was recorded in retained earnings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024. \nIn January 2025, the board of directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.24\n per share on our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on March 28, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2025. The estimated aggregate payment of this dividend is $\n138\n million. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by the board of directors.\nF-32\nThe board of directors maintains a dividend policy with the intention to provide shareholders with regular and increasing dividends as earnings and cash flows increase.\n13. \nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumerator:\n(in millions, except share and per share amounts)\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n1,117\n \n$\n1,059\n \n$\n1,125\n \nDenominator:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding for basic earnings per share\n575,428,536\n \n504,909,392\n \n492,420,787\n \nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities - Employee equity awards\n3,760,986\n \n3,483,590\n \n5,436,778\n \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share\n579,189,522\n \n508,392,982\n \n497,857,565\n \nBasic and diluted earnings per share:\nBasic earnings per share\n$\n1.94\n \n$\n2.10\n \n$\n2.28\n \nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n1.93\n \n$\n2.08\n \n$\n2.26\n \nIn the table above, employee equity awards from our PSU program, which are considered contingently issuable, are included in the computation of dilutive earnings per share on a weighted average basis when management determines that the applicable performance criteria would have been met if the performance period ended as of the date of the relevant computation.\n \nSecurities that were \nnot\n included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect was antidilutive were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n14. \nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe following tables present our financial assets and financial liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\n(in millions)\nEuropean government debt securities\n$\n166\n \n$\n166\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nSwedish mortgage bonds\n13\n \n—\n \n13\n \n—\n \nTime deposits\n5\n \n—\n \n5\n \n—\n \nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n184\n \n$\n166\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n—\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\n(in millions)\nEuropean government debt securities\n$\n170\n \n$\n170\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nState-owned enterprises and municipal securities\n11\n \n—\n \n11\n \n—\n \nSwedish mortgage bonds\n7\n \n—\n \n7\n \n—\n \nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n188\n \n$\n170\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n—\n \nFinancial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nSome of our financial instruments are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. Such financial assets and financial liabilities include: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, net, certain other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, Section 31 fees payable to SEC, accrued personnel costs, commercial paper and certain other current liabilities.\nWe have certain investments, primarily our investment in OCC, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We have elected the measurement alternative for the majority of our equity securities, which primarily represent various strategic investments made through our corporate venture program. See “Equity Method Investments,” and “Equity Securities,” of Note 6, “Investments,” for further discussion.\nF-33\nWe also consider our debt obligations to be financial instruments. As of December 31, 2024, the majority of our debt obligations were fixed-rate obligations. We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, as the interest rates on this facility have a variable rate depending on the maturity of the borrowing and the implied underlying reference rate. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates on amounts outstanding from the sale of commercial paper under our commercial paper program. The fair value of our remaining debt obligations utilizing discounted cash flow analyses for our floating rate debt, and prevailing market rates for our fixed rate debt was $\n8.8\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and $\n10.0\n billion as of December 31, 2023. The discounted cash flow analyses are based on borrowing rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities. Our commercial paper and our fixed rate and floating rate debt are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nFor further discussion of our debt obligations, see Note 9, “Debt Obligations.”\nNon-Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nOur non-financial assets, which include goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measures of non-financial assets are primarily used in the impairment analysis of these assets. Any resulting asset impairment would require that the non-financial asset be recorded at its fair value. Nasdaq uses Level 3 inputs to measure the fair value of the above assets on a non-recurring basis. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were \nno\n non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\n15. \nCLEARING OPERATIONS\nNasdaq\n \nClearing\nNasdaq Clearing is authorized and supervised under EMIR as a multi-asset clearinghouse by the SFSA. Such authorization is effective for all member states of the European Union and certain other non-member states that are part of the European Economic Area, including Norway. The clearinghouse acts as the CCP for exchange and OTC trades in equity derivatives, fixed income derivatives, resale and repurchase contracts, power derivatives, emission allowance derivatives, and seafood derivatives. In January 2025, we entered into an agreement to transfer existing open positions in our Nordic power derivatives trading and clearing business to a European exchange. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals. See “Market Services” of Note 1, “Organization and Nature of Operations,” for further discussion. Additionally, beginning in January 2025, Nasdaq is no longer offering seafood derivatives clearing. \nThrough our clearing operations in the financial markets, which include the resale and repurchase market, the commodities markets, and the seafood market, Nasdaq Clearing is the legal counterparty for, and guarantees the fulfillment of, each contract cleared. These contracts are not used by Nasdaq Clearing for the purpose of trading on its own behalf. As the legal counterparty of each transaction, Nasdaq Clearing bears the counterparty risk between the purchaser and seller in the contract. In its guarantor role, Nasdaq Clearing has precisely equal and offsetting claims to and from clearing members on opposite sides of each contract, standing as the CCP on every contract cleared. In accordance with the rules and regulations of Nasdaq Clearing, default fund and margin collateral requirements are calculated for each clearing member’s positions in accounts with the CCP. See “Default Fund Contributions and Margin Deposits” below for further discussion of Nasdaq Clearing’s default fund and margin requirements.\nNasdaq Clearing maintains \nthree\n member sponsored default funds: one related to financial markets, one related to commodities markets and one related to the seafood market. Under this structure, Nasdaq Clearing and its clearing members must contribute to the total regulatory capital related to the clearing operations of Nasdaq Clearing. This structure applies an initial separation of default fund contributions for the financial, commodities and seafood markets in order to create a buffer for each market’s counterparty risks. See “Default Fund Contributions” below for further discussion of Nasdaq Clearing’s default fund. A power of assessment and a liability waterfall have also been implemented to further align risk between Nasdaq Clearing and its clearing members. See “Power of Assessment” and “Liability Waterfall” below for further discussion. \nDefault Fund Contributions and Margin Deposits\nAs of December 31, 2024, clearing member default fund contributions and margin deposits were as follows:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \nCash Contributions\nNon-Cash Contributions\nTotal Contributions\n \n(in millions)\nDefault fund contributions\n$\n968\n \n$\n139\n \n$\n1,107\n \nMargin deposits\n4,696\n \n5,084\n \n9,780\n \nTotal\n$\n5,664\n \n$\n5,223\n \n$\n10,887\n \nOf the total default fund contributions of $\n1,107\n million, Nasdaq Clearing can utilize $\n1,068\n million as capital resources in the event of a counterparty default. The remaining balance of $\n39\n million pertains to member posted surplus balances.\nOur clearinghouse holds material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. \nF-34\nClearing member cash contributions are maintained in demand deposits held at central banks and large, highly rated financial institutions or secured through direct investments, primarily central bank certificates and highly rated European government debt securities with original maturities primarily one year or less, reverse repurchase agreements and multilateral development bank debt securities. Investments in reverse repurchase agreements range in maturity from \n2\n to \n14\n days and are secured with highly rated government securities and multilateral development banks. The carrying value of these securities approximates their fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments and reverse repurchase agreements.\nNasdaq Clearing has invested the total cash contributions of $\n5,664\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n7,275\n million as of December 31, 2023, in accordance with its investment policy as follows:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n(in millions)\nDemand deposits\n$\n3,616\n \n$\n5,344\n \nCentral bank certificates\n767\n \n1,301\n \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\n$\n4,383\n \n$\n6,645\n \nEuropean government debt securities\n465\n \n306\n \nReverse repurchase agreements\n610\n \n209\n \nMultilateral development bank debt securities\n206\n \n115\n \nInvestments\n$\n1,281\n \n$\n630\n \nTotal\n$\n5,664\n \n$\n7,275\n \nIn the table above, the change from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 includes currency translation adjustments of $\n525\n million for restricted cash and cash equivalents and $\n56\n million for investments.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, investments related to default funds and margin deposits, net includes purchases of investment securities of $\n33,693\n million, $\n53,657\n million and $\n47,525\n million, respectively, and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investment securities of $\n32,986\n million, $\n53,583\n million and $\n47,736\n million, respectively.\nIn the investment activity related to default fund and margin contributions, we are exposed to counterparty risk related to reverse repurchase agreement transactions, which reflect the risk that the counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to Nasdaq Clearing. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the reverse repurchase agreement to high quality issuers, primarily government securities and other securities explicitly guaranteed by a government. The value of the underlying security is monitored during the lifetime of the contract, and in the event the market value of the underlying security falls below the reverse repurchase amount, our clearinghouse may require additional collateral or a reset of the contract.\nDefault Fund Contributions\nRequired contributions to the default funds are proportional to the exposures of each clearing member. When a clearing member is active in more than one market, contributions must be made to all markets’ default funds in which the member is active. Clearing members’ eligible contributions may include cash and non-cash contributions. Cash contributions received are maintained in demand deposits held at central banks and large, highly rated financial institutions or invested by Nasdaq Clearing, in accordance with its investment policy, either in central bank certificates, highly rated government debt securities, reverse repurchase agreements with highly rated government debt securities as collateral, or multilateral development bank debt securities. Nasdaq Clearing maintains and manages all cash deposits related to margin collateral. All risks and rewards of collateral ownership, including interest, belong to Nasdaq Clearing. Clearing members’ cash contributions are included in default funds and margin deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a current asset and a current liability. Non-cash contributions include highly rated government debt securities that must meet specific criteria approved by Nasdaq Clearing. Non-cash contributions are pledged assets that are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Nasdaq Clearing does not take legal ownership of these assets and the risks and rewards remain with the clearing members. These balances may fluctuate over time due to changes in the amount of deposits required and whether members choose to provide cash or non-cash contributions. \nF-35\nIn addition to clearing members’ required contributions to the liability waterfall, Nasdaq Clearing is also required to contribute capital to the liability waterfall and overall regulatory capital as specified under its clearinghouse rules. As of December 31, 2024, Nasdaq Clearing committed capital totaling $\n129\n million to the liability waterfall and overall regulatory capital, in the form of government debt securities, which are recorded as financial investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The combined regulatory capital of the clearing members and Nasdaq Clearing is intended to secure the obligations of a clearing member exceeding such member’s own margin and default fund deposits and may be used to cover losses sustained by a clearing member in the event of a default.\nMargin Deposits\nNasdaq Clearing requires all clearing members to provide collateral, which may consist of cash and non-cash contributions, to guarantee performance on the clearing members’ open positions, or initial margin. In addition, clearing members must also provide collateral to cover the daily margin call if needed. See “Default Fund Contributions” above for further discussion of cash and non-cash contributions.\nSimilar to default fund contributions, Nasdaq Clearing maintains and manages all cash deposits related to margin collateral. All risks and rewards of collateral ownership, including interest, belong to Nasdaq Clearing and are recorded in revenues. These cash deposits are recorded in default funds and margin deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a current asset and a current liability. Pledged margin collateral is not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as all risks and rewards of collateral ownership, including interest, belong to the counterparty. \nNasdaq Clearing marks to market all outstanding contracts and requires payment from clearing members whose positions have lost value. The mark-to-market process helps identify any clearing members that may not be able to satisfy their financial obligations in a timely manner allowing Nasdaq Clearing the ability to mitigate the risk of a clearing member defaulting due to exceptionally large losses. In the event of a default, Nasdaq Clearing can access the defaulting member’s margin and default fund deposits to cover the defaulting member’s losses.\nRegulatory Capital and Risk Management Calculations\nNasdaq Clearing manages risk through a comprehensive counterparty risk management framework, which comprises policies, procedures, standards and financial resources. The level of regulatory capital is determined in accordance with Nasdaq Clearing’s regulatory capital and default fund policy, as approved by the SFSA. Regulatory capital calculations are continuously updated through a proprietary capital-at-risk calculation model that establishes the appropriate level of capital.\nAs mentioned above, Nasdaq Clearing is the legal counterparty for each contract cleared and thereby guarantees the fulfillment of each contract. Nasdaq Clearing accounts for this guarantee as a performance guarantee. We determine the fair value of the performance guarantee by considering daily settlement of contracts and other margining and default fund requirements, the risk management program, historical evidence of default payments, and the estimated probability of potential default payouts. The calculation is determined using proprietary risk management software that simulates gains and losses based on historical market prices, extreme but plausible market scenarios, volatility and other factors present at that point in time for those particular unsettled contracts. Based on this analysis, excluding any liability related to the Nasdaq commodities clearing default (see discussion above), the estimated liability was nominal and \nno\n liability was recorded as of December 31, 2024.\nPower of Assessment \nTo further strengthen the contingent financial resources of the clearinghouse, Nasdaq Clearing has power of assessment that provides the ability to collect additional funds from its clearing members to cover a defaulting member’s remaining obligations up to the limits established under the terms of the clearinghouse rules. The power of assessment corresponds to \n230\n% of the clearing member’s aggregate contribution to the financial, commodities and seafood markets’ default funds.\nLiability Waterfall\nThe liability waterfall is the priority order in which the capital resources would be utilized in the event of a default where the defaulting clearing member’s collateral and default fund contribution would not be sufficient to cover the cost to settle its portfolio. If a default occurs and the defaulting clearing member’s collateral, including cash deposits and pledged assets, is depleted, then capital is utilized in the following amount and order:\n•\njunior capital contributed by Nasdaq Clearing, which totaled $\n40\n million as of December 31, 2024;\n•\na loss-sharing pool related only to the financial market that is contributed to by clearing members and only applies if the defaulting member’s portfolio includes interest rate swap products;\n•\nspecific market default fund where the loss occurred (i.e., the financial, commodities, or seafood market), which includes capital contributions of the clearing members on a pro-rata basis; and\n•\nfully segregated senior capital for each specific market contributed by Nasdaq Clearing, calculated in accordance with clearinghouse rules, which totaled $\n19\n million as of December 31, 2024.\nF-36\nIf additional funds are needed after utilization of the liability waterfall, or if part of the waterfall has been utilized and needs to be replenished, then Nasdaq Clearing will utilize its power of assessment and additional capital contributions will be required by non-defaulting members up to the limits established under the terms of the clearinghouse rules.\nIn addition to the capital held to withstand counterparty defaults described above, Nasdaq Clearing also has committed capital of $\n70\n million to ensure that it can handle an orderly wind-down of its operation, and that it is adequately protected against investment, operational, legal, and business risks.\nMarket Value of Derivative Contracts Outstanding \nThe following table presents the market value of derivative contracts outstanding prior to netting:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \n(in millions)\nCommodity and seafood options, futures and forwards\n$\n21\n \nFixed-income options and futures\n627\n \nStock options and futures\n197\n \nIndex options and futures\n44\n \nTotal\n$\n889\n \nIn the table above: \n•\nWe determined the fair value of our option contracts using standard valuation models that were based on market-based observable inputs including implied volatility, interest rates and the spot price of the underlying instrument.\n•\nWe determined the fair value of our futures contracts based upon quoted market prices and average quoted market yields.\n•\nWe determined the fair value of our forward contracts using standard valuation models that were based on market-based observable inputs including benchmark rates and the spot price of the underlying instrument.\nDerivative Contracts Cleared\nThe following table presents the total number of derivative contracts cleared through Nasdaq Clearing for the\n year\ns ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nCommodity and seafood options, futures and forwards\n234,622\n \n233,194\n \nFixed-income options and futures\n18,830,460\n \n19,175,402\n \nStock options and futures\n23,530,035\n \n20,728,290\n \nIndex options and futures\n35,069,931\n \n40,009,367\n \nTotal\n77,665,048\n \n80,146,253\n \nIn the table above, the total volume in cleared power related to commodity contracts was \n160\n Terawatt hours (TWh) and \n422\n TWh for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements Contracts Outstanding and Cleared\nThe outstanding contract value of resale and repurchase agreements was $\n200\n million and $\n580\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total number of resale and repurchase agreements contracts cleared was \n4,929,765\n and \n4,669,740\n for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n16. \nLEASES\nWe have operating leases, which are primarily real estate leases, predominantly for our U.S. and European headquarters, data centers and for general office space. \nThe following table provides supplemental balance sheet information related to Nasdaq\n’\ns operating leases:\nLeases\nBalance Sheet Classification\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets:\n(in millions)\nOperating lease assets\nOperating lease assets\n$\n375\n \n$\n402\n \nLiabilities:\nCurrent lease liabilities\nOther current liabilities\n$\n55\n \n$\n62\n \nNon-current lease liabilities\nOperating lease liabilities\n388\n \n417\n \nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n443\n \n$\n479\n \nThe following table summarizes Nasdaq’s lease cost: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nOperating lease cost\n$\n78\n \n$\n88\n \n$\n75\n \nVariable lease cost\n37\n \n44\n \n32\n \nSublease income\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nTotal lease cost\n$\n112\n \n$\n129\n \n$\n104\n \nIn the table above, operating lease costs include short-term lease cost, which was immaterial.\nF-37\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we initiated a review of our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. As a result of this ongoing review, for the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of $\n23\n million, of which $\n13\n million related to operating lease asset impairment and is included in operating lease cost in the table above, $\n5\n million related to exit costs and is included in variable lease cost in the table above and $\n5\n million related to impairment of leasehold improvements, which are recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We fully impaired our lease assets for locations that we vacated with no intention to sublease. Substantially all of the property, equipment and leasehold improvements associated with the vacated leased office space were fully impaired as there are no expected future cash flows for these items. \nThe following table reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for the following \nyears and total of the remaining years to the operating lease liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDecember 31, 2024\n(in millions)\n2025\n$\n72\n \n2026\n60\n \n2027\n57\n \n2028\n55\n \n2029\n53\n \n2030+\n231\n \nTotal lease payments\n$\n528\n \nLess: interest\n(\n85\n)\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n$\n443\n \nIn the table above, interest is calculated using the interest rate for each lease. Present value of lease liabilities includes the current portion of $\n55\n million.\nTotal lease payments in the table above excludes $\n83\n million of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced. This primarily relates to a new lease signed in the first quarter of 2024 for our European headquarters. This lease will commence in 2025 with a lease term of \n10\n years. These payments also include a data center lease for which we have not yet obtained full control of the leased premises.\nThe following table provides information related to Nasdaq’s lease term and discount rate:\nDecember 31, 2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years)\n9.1\nWeighted-average discount rate\n3.9\n \n%\nThe following table provides supplemental cash flow information related to Nasdaq’s operating leases:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities\n$\n84\n \n$\n78\n \n$\n66\n \nLease assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities\n$\n34\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n137\n \n17. \nINCOME TAXES\nIncome\n \nBefore Income Tax Provision\nThe following table presents the domestic and foreign components of income before income tax provision:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nDomestic\n$\n1,091\n \n$\n1,073\n \n$\n1,216\n \nForeign\n358\n \n328\n \n259\n \nIncome before income tax provision\n$\n1,449\n \n$\n1,401\n \n$\n1,475\n \nIncome Tax Provision\nThe income tax provision consists of the following amounts:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions)\nCurrent income taxes provision:\n \nFederal\n$\n166\n \n$\n145\n \n$\n170\n \nState\n70\n \n52\n \n67\n \nForeign\n165\n \n79\n \n77\n \nTotal current income taxes provision\n401\n \n276\n \n314\n \nDeferred income taxes provision (benefit):\n \n \n \nFederal\n(\n25\n)\n51\n \n36\n \nState\n2\n \n8\n \n6\n \nForeign\n(\n44\n)\n9\n \n(\n4\n)\nTotal deferred income taxes (benefit) provision\n(\n67\n)\n68\n \n38\n \nTotal income tax provision\n$\n334\n \n$\n344\n \n$\n352\n \nWe have determined that undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries are not considered indefinitely reinvested and would not give rise to a material tax liability when remitted.

A determination of an unrecognized deferred tax liability related to such outside basis differences is not practicable.\nF-38\nA reconciliation of the income tax provision, based on the U.S. federal statutory rate, to our actual income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nFederal income tax provision at the statutory rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nState income tax provision, net of federal effect\n2.9\n \n%\n3.2\n \n%\n3.8\n \n%\nExcess tax benefits related to employee share-based compensation\n(\n0.3\n)\n%\n(\n0.7\n)\n%\n(\n0.9\n)\n%\nNon-U.S. subsidiary earnings\n1.6\n \n%\n2.5\n \n%\n1.2\n \n%\nTax credits and deductions\n(\n1.7\n)\n%\n(\n0.2\n)\n%\n(\n0.3\n)\n%\nChange in unrecognized tax benefits\n0.4\n \n%\n1.0\n \n%\n1.1\n \n%\nDeduction for foreign derived intangible income\n(\n2.8\n)\n%\n(\n1.6\n)\n%\n(\n1.0\n)\n%\nIntra-group transfer of IP\n1.7\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nOther, net\n0.3\n \n%\n(\n0.6\n)\n%\n(\n1.0\n)\n%\nActual income tax provision\n23.1\n \n%\n24.6\n \n%\n23.9\n \n%\nThe lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the purchase of energy tax credits made available under the Inflation Reduction Act and a reduction in U.S. taxes on international income related to the changes in our tax profile from recent acquisitions, partially offset by the completion of an intra-group transfer of certain IP assets from a wholly-owned, non-U.S. subsidiary to our U.S. headquarters, in order to better align with current and future business operations, resulted in a one-time net tax expense of $\n33\n million. \nThe effective tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses. These same and other factors, including history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe temporary differences, which give rise to our deferred tax assets and (liabilities), consisted of the following:\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(in millions)\nDeferred tax assets:\n \n \nDeferred revenues\n$\n40\n \n$\n19\n \nForeign net operating loss\n3\n \n12\n \nCapitalized research and development costs\n43\n \n16\n \nState net operating loss\n3\n \n3\n \nCompensation and benefits\n47\n \n45\n \nDeferred interest expense\n63\n \n55\n \nTax credits\n18\n \n26\n \nFederal benefit of uncertain tax positions\n16\n \n12\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n113\n \n118\n \nOther\n41\n \n29\n \nGross deferred tax assets\n387\n \n335\n \nLess: valuation allowance\n—\n \n(\n4\n)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n$\n387\n \n$\n331\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\n \n \nDepreciation\n$\n(\n30\n)\n$\n(\n37\n)\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets and goodwill\n(\n1,698\n)\n(\n1,736\n)\nInvestments\n(\n81\n)\n(\n74\n)\nUnrealized gains\n(\n55\n)\n(\n11\n)\nOperating lease assets\n(\n95\n)\n(\n99\n)\nOther\n(\n8\n)\n(\n9\n)\nGross deferred tax liabilities\n$\n(\n1,967\n)\n$\n(\n1,966\n)\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$\n(\n1,580\n)\n$\n(\n1,635\n)\nReported as:\nNon-current deferred tax assets\n$\n14\n \n$\n7\n \nDeferred tax liabilities, net\n(\n1,594\n)\n(\n1,642\n)\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$\n(\n1,580\n)\n$\n(\n1,635\n)\nIn the table above, non-current deferred tax assets are included in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe had \nno\n valuation allowances as of December 31, 2024 and $\n4\n million as of December 31, 2023 due to recurring operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction. Based on all available positive and negative evidence, we believe the sources of future taxable income are sufficient to realize the remainder of Nasdaq’s deferred tax asset inventory.\nF-39\nNasdaq has deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses, or NOLs, in U.S. state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions with the following expiration dates:\nJurisdiction\nDecember 31, 2024\nExpiration Date\n(in millions)\nForeign NOL\n$\n3\n \n2039-2044\nU.S. state and local NOL\n3\n \n2025-2043\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nBeginning balance\n$\n80\n \n$\n70\n \n$\n57\n \nAdditions as a result of tax positions taken in prior periods\n3\n \n2\n \n13\n \nAdditions as a result of tax positions taken in the current period\n15\n \n25\n \n9\n \nReductions related to settlements with taxing authorities\n(\n6\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n7\n)\nReductions as a result of lapses of the applicable statute of limitations\n(\n8\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n2\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n84\n \n$\n80\n \n$\n70\n \nUnrecognized tax benefits in the table above, if recognized in the future, would affect our effective tax rate.

Accrued interest and penalties, net of tax effect were $\n10\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n6\n million as of December 31, 2023.\nTax Audits\nNasdaq and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and applicable state and local income tax returns and non-U.S. income tax returns. We are subject to examination by federal, state and local, and foreign tax authorities. Our Federal income tax return is under audit for tax year 2018 and is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the years 2021 through 2023. Several state tax returns are currently under examination by the respective tax authorities for the years 2014 through 2023. Non-U.S. tax returns are subject to examination by the respective tax authorities for the years 2019 through 2023. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by each jurisdiction and have established tax reserves that we believe are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Examination outcomes and the timing of examination settlements are subject to uncertainty. Although the results of such examinations may have an impact on our \nunrecognized tax benefits, we do not anticipate that such impact will be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We do not expect to settle any material tax audits in the next twelve months.\n18. \nCOMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES\nGuarantees Issued and Credit Facilities Available\nIn addition to the default fund contributions and margin collateral pledged by clearing members discussed in Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” we have obtained financial guarantees and credit facilities, which are guaranteed by us through counter indemnities, to provide further liquidity related to our clearing businesses. Financial guarantees issued to us totaled $\n4\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As discussed in “Other Credit Facilities,” of Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” we also have credit facilities primarily related to our Nasdaq Clearing operations, which are available in multiple currencies, and totaled $\n174\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n191\n million as of December 31, 2023 in available liquidity, \nnone\n of which was utilized.\nOther Guarantees\nThrough our clearing operations in the financial markets, Nasdaq Clearing is the legal counterparty for, and guarantees the performance of, its clearing members. See Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” for further discussion of Nasdaq Clearing performance guarantees.\nWe have provided a guarantee related to lease obligations for The Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center, Inc., which is a not-for-profit organization designed to convene, connect and engage aspiring and current entrepreneurs. This entity is not included in the consolidated financial statements of Nasdaq.\nWe believe that the potential for us to be required to make payments under these arrangements is unlikely. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the above guarantees.\nRouting Brokerage Activities\nOne of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services, provides a guarantee to securities clearinghouses and exchanges under its standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. If a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to a clearinghouse or exchange, other members would be required to meet its shortfalls. To mitigate these performance risks, the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to post collateral, as well as meet certain minimum financial standards. Nasdaq Execution Services’ maximum potential liability under these arrangements cannot be quantified. However, we believe that the potential for Nasdaq Execution Services to be required to make payments under these arrangements is unlikely. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these arrangements.\nF-40\nLegal and Regulatory Matters \nEuropean Commission Matter\nIn September 2024, the European Commission conducted an inspection at the Nasdaq Stockholm offices. The inspection related to a potential competition law concern regarding the trading of Nordics financial derivatives. We have been cooperating with the European Commission, but are uncertain about the duration or ultimate outcome of the European Commission’s review, or to the extent there is any finding against us, the nature of any remedies or the amount of any fines.\nOther Matters\nExcept as disclosed above and in our prior reports filed under the Exchange Act, we are not currently a party to any litigation or proceeding that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, or operating results. However, from time to time, we have been threatened with, or named as a defendant in, lawsuits or involved in regulatory proceedings.\nIn the normal course of business, Nasdaq discusses matters with its regulators raised during regulatory examinations or otherwise subject to their inquiries. Management believes that censures, fines, penalties or other sanctions that could result from any ongoing examinations or inquiries will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, we are unable to predict the outcome or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or the potential fines, penalties or injunctive or other equitable relief, if any, that may result from these matters.\nTax Audits\nWe are engaged in ongoing discussions and audits with taxing authorities on various tax matters, the resolutions of which are uncertain. Currently, there are matters that may lead to assessments, some of which may not be resolved for several years. Based on currently available information, we believe we have adequately provided for any assessments that could result from those proceedings where it is more likely than not that we will be assessed. We review our positions on these matters as they progress. See “Tax Audits,” of Note 17, “Income Taxes,” for further discussion.\n19. \nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nWe manage, operate and provide our products and services in \nthree\n business segments: Capital Access Platforms, Financial Technology and Market Services. See Note 1, “Organization and Nature of Operations,” for further discussion of our reportable segments.\nOur management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages these businesses as \nthree\n separate segments. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is operating income. Our CODM, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, does not review total assets or statements of income below operating income by segments as key performance metrics; therefore, such information is not presented below.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” and applied it retrospectively to include significant segment expenses, as defined within ASU 2023-07, that are regularly provided to our chief operating decision maker, or CODM.\nThe following table presents certain information regarding our business segments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nF-41\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nCapital Access Platforms\nTotal revenues\n$\n1,972\n \n$\n1,770\n \n$\n1,682\n \nDirect and directly consumed expenses\n674\n \n653\n \n630\n \nOther expenses\n164\n \n146\n \n138\n \nOperating income\n$\n1,134\n \n$\n971\n \n$\n914\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n41\n \n39\n \n36\n \nPurchase of property and equipment\n52\n \n53\n \n50\n \nFinancial Technology\nTotal revenues\n$\n1,655\n \n$\n1,099\n \n$\n864\n \nDirect and directly consumed expenses\n794\n \n536\n \n494\n \nOther expenses\n91\n \n69\n \n71\n \nOperating income\n$\n770\n \n$\n494\n \n$\n299\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n43\n \n36\n \n35\n \nPurchase of property and equipment\n105\n \n50\n \n49\n \nMarket Services\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,771\n \n$\n3,156\n \n$\n3,632\n \nTransaction-based expenses\n(\n2,751\n)\n(\n2,169\n)\n(\n2,644\n)\nRevenues less transaction-based expenses\n$\n1,020\n \n$\n987\n \n$\n988\n \nDirect and directly consumed expenses\n339\n \n330\n \n293\n \nOther expenses\n84\n \n75\n \n68\n \nOperating income\n$\n597\n \n$\n582\n \n$\n627\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n39\n \n34\n \n32\n \nPurchase of property and equipment\n50\n \n55\n \n53\n \nCorporate\nTotal revenues\n$\n2\n \n$\n39\n \n$\n48\n \nOther expenses\n705\n \n508\n \n324\n \nOperating loss\n$\n(\n703\n)\n$\n(\n469\n)\n$\n(\n276\n)\nDepreciation and amortization\n490\n \n214\n \n155\n \nConsolidated\nTotal revenues\n$\n7,400\n \n$\n6,064\n \n$\n6,226\n \nTransaction-based expenses\n(\n2,751\n)\n(\n2,169\n)\n(\n2,644\n)\nRevenues less transaction-based expenses\n$\n4,649\n \n$\n3,895\n \n$\n3,582\n \nDirect and directly consumed expenses\n1,807\n \n1,519\n \n1,417\n \nOther expenses\n1,044\n \n798\n \n601\n \nOperating income\n$\n1,798\n \n$\n1,578\n \n$\n1,564\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n613\n \n323\n \n258\n \nPurchase of property and equipment\n207\n \n158\n \n152\n \nDirect and directly consumed expenses in the preceding table represent costs for resources directly used by the segment for revenue generating activities. Other expenses include indirect overhead costs allocated to our segments. During the first year of the integration of Adenza and Verafin, the allocation of these indirect overhead costs to the Financial Technology segment were phased in and therefore these allocations may change in the future. Other expenses also includes expenses allocated to our Corporate segment.\n \nThe following table summarizes revenues and expenses allocated to our Corporate segment:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nRevenues:\nDivested businesses\n$\n36\n \n$\n39\n \n$\n48\n \nAdenza purchase accounting adjustment\n(\n34\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nExpenses:\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets\n488\n \n206\n \n153\n \nMerger and strategic initiatives expense\n35\n \n148\n \n82\n \nRestructuring charges\n116\n \n80\n \n15\n \nLease asset impairments\n—\n \n25\n \n—\n \nLegal and regulatory matters\n20\n \n12\n \n26\n \nExtinguishment of debt\n4\n \n—\n \n16\n \nPension Settlement\n23\n \n9\n \n—\n \nExpenses - divested businesses\n16\n \n21\n \n27\n \nOther\n3\n \n7\n \n5\n \nTotal expenses\n$\n705\n \n$\n508\n \n$\n324\n \nOperating loss\n$\n(\n703\n)\n$\n(\n469\n)\n$\n(\n276\n)\nFor further discussion of our segments’ results, see “Segment Operating Results,” of “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nF-42\nThe items in the preceding table are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by our CODM, as we believe they do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of a particular segment’s ongoing operating performance. Management does not consider these items for the purpose of evaluating the performance of our segments or their managers or when making decisions to allocate resources. Therefore, we believe performance measures excluding the below items provide management with a useful representation of our segments’ ongoing activity in each period. These items, which are presented in the tables above, include the following:\n•\nRevenues and expenses - divested businesses: \nIn June 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell our Nordic power trading and clearing business, which was subsequently terminated in June 2024. In January 2025, we entered into a new agreement to transfer existing open positions in our Nordic power derivatives trading and clearing business to a European exchange. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals. Revenues and expenses related to this business for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, continue to be included as revenues and expenses - divested businesses. Historically, these amounts were included in our Market Services and Capital Access Platforms segments. For 2022, this also includes the revenues and expenses of our U.S. Fixed Income business, which was previously included in our Market Services and Capital Access Platforms segments.\n•\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets: \nWe amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the segments, and the relative operating performance of the segments between periods.\n•\nMerger and strategic initiatives expense: \nWe have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years that have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. These expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, these costs primarily relate to the Adenza acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2024, these costs were partially offset by receipt of a fee related to the termination of the proposed divestiture of our Nordic power trading and clearing business.\n•\nRestructuring charges: \nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, following the closing of the Adenza acquisition, our management approved, committed to and initiated a restructuring program, “Adenza Restructuring” to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization. In October 2022, following our September 2022 announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. In September 2024, we completed our divisional alignment program. See Note 20, “Restructuring Charges,” for further discussion of these plans. \n•\nOther items: \nWe have included certain other charges or gains in corporate items, to the extent we believe they should be excluded when evaluating the ongoing operating performance of each individual segment. Other items primarily include: \n◦\nAdenza purchase accounting adjustment: \nAs discussed in Note 3, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” during the third quarter of 2024, as part of finalizing the purchase accounting of the Adenza acquisition, a one-time net revenue reduction of $\n32\n million was recorded in our Financial Technology segment, reflecting the net impact of the accounting change on AxiomSL subscription revenue from the date of the Adenza acquisition. For purposes of evaluating the performance of our segments, we have excluded the reduction of $\n34\n million as this relates to the prior year impact of this change. We have not excluded the $\n2\n million offsetting current year impact of this change.  \n◦\nLease asset impairments: \nFor year ended December 31, 2023, this included impairment charges related to our operating lease assets and leasehold improvements associated with vacating certain leased office space, which are recorded in occupancy and depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 16, “Leases,” for further discussion. \n◦\nLegal and regulatory matters: \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, this primarily related to the settlement of a previously disclosed SFSA inquiry, and accruals related to certain legal matters. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, this also included accruals related to certain legal matters. For the year ended December 31, 2023, these charges were partially offset by insurance recoveries related to certain legal matters. The fine is recorded in regulatory expense and the accruals and insurance recoveries are recorded in professional and contract services and general, administrative and other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n◦\nExtinguishment of debt:\n For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, this includes a loss on extinguishment of debt, which is recorded under general, administrative and other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nF-43\n◦\nPension settlement charge: \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a pre-tax charge as a result of settling our U.S. pension plan. The plan was terminated and partially settled in 2023, with final settlement occurring during the first quarter of 2024. The pre-tax charge is recorded in compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 10, “Retirement Plans,” for further discussion. \nGeographic Data\nThe following table presents total revenues and property and equipment, net by geographic area for 2024, 2023 and 2022. Revenues are classified based upon the location of the customer. Property and equipment information is based on the physical location of the assets. \n \nTotal\nRevenues\nProperty and\nEquipment, Net\n2024:\n (in millions)\nUnited States\n$\n5,817\n \n$\n425\n \nAll other countries\n1,583\n \n168\n \nTotal\n$\n7,400\n \n$\n593\n \n2023:\n \n \nUnited States\n$\n4,870\n \n$\n367\n \nAll other countries\n1,194\n \n209\n \nTotal\n$\n6,064\n \n$\n576\n \n2022:\n \n \nUnited States\n$\n5,100\n \n$\n344\n \nAll other countries\n1,126\n \n188\n \nTotal\n$\n6,226\n \n$\n532\n \nProperty and equipment, net for all other countries primarily includes assets held in Sweden. No single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n20. \nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, following the closing of the Adenza acquisition, our management approved, committed to and initiated a restructuring program, “Adenza Restructuring” to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization. We further expanded this program in the fourth quarter of 2024 to accelerate our momentum. In connection with this program, we expect to incur approximately $\n140\n million in pre-tax charges. We have incurred costs principally related to employee-related costs, contract terminations, asset impairments and other related costs and expect to incur additional costs in these areas in an effort to accelerate efficiencies through location strategy and enhanced AI capabilities. Actions taken as part of this program are expected to be completed by the end of 2025, while certain costs may be recognized in the first half of 2026. We expect to achieve benefits primarily in the form of expense synergies. \nIn October 2022, following our September 2022 announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. As of September 30, 2024, we completed our divisional alignment program and recognized total pre-tax charges of $\n139\n million over a \ntwo-year\n period, within the anticipated range of $\n115\n million to $\n145\n million.\nCosts related to these programs are recorded as restructuring charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Adenza restructuring program and our divisional alignment program charges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 as well as total program costs incurred since the inception date of each program.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nAsset impairment charges\nAdenza restructuring\n$\n28\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nDivisional realignment\n9\n \n12\n \n8\n \nConsulting services\nAdenza restructuring\n5\n \n3\n \n—\n \nDivisional realignment\n27\n \n34\n \n3\n \nEmployee-related costs\nAdenza restructuring\n20\n \n6\n \n—\n \nDivisional realignment\n8\n \n13\n \n3\n \nOther\nAdenza restructuring\n9\n \n1\n \n—\n \nDivisional realignment\n10\n \n11\n \n1\n \nTotal restructuring charges\n$\n116\n \n$\n80\n \n$\n15\n \nTotal Program Costs Incurred\nAdenza restructuring\n$\n72\n \nDivisional realignment\n$\n139\n \nF-44"
