Net income rose by $449 million in 2024, compared with 2023, including a $204 million increase in net investment gains on an after-tax basis .\n Loss experience for our insurance operations is influenced by many factors, as discussed in Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves . Property casualty net written premiums grew 15% and earned premiums grew 12% in 2024 . Underwriting results improved in both 2024 and 2023, compared with the respective prior-year period .\n The $179 million increase in 2024 underwriting profit, compared with 2023, included a $66 million increase in losses from natural catastrophe events and $27 million less benefit from net favorable reserve development on prior accident years before catastrophe losses . A lower ratio indicates more favorable results and better underlying performance . In 2024, 2023 and 2022, favorable development on reserves for claims that occurred in prior accidents helped offset other incurred losses and loss expenses .\n Cincinnati Financial Corporation's financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP . The company's critical accounting policies are discussed in Item 8, Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements . The audit committee of the board of directors reviews the annual financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm . Actual results could differ from those estimates .\n Unpaid loss and loss expenses are the estimated amounts necessary to pay for and settle all outstanding insured claims, including incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims . These reserves account for unpaid losses and losses as of a financial statement date . Gross loss and expenses were $9.937 billion at year-end 2024 compared with $8.975 billion at year-end 2023 .\n Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 51: \"We also establish IBNR reserves to provide for all unpaid loss and loss expenses not accounted for by case reserves\" Case reserves of all sizes are generally reviewed on a 90-day cycle, or more frequently if new information about a loss becomes available . We monitor industry trends, cost trends, relevant court cases, legislative activity and other current events .\n PCS defines a catastrophe as an event that causes $25 million or more in insured property losses . Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global use of third-party catastrophe models, industry estimates, and our own proprietary adjustments are used for the estimate of ultimate losses for each catastrophe event . For asbestos and environmental claims, we calculate IBNR reserves by deriving an actuarially-based estimate of total unpaid loss and loss expenses .\n Claim counts reported and used in reserving process are measured by insurance coverages that are triggered when a loss occurs and a reserve is established . Coverages defined as unique combinations of certain attributes such as line of business and cause of loss . Unpaid loss and loss expenses are inherently uncertain as to timing and amount .\n Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 52: \"Our actuarial staff bases its IBNR reserve estimates for these losses primarily on the indications of methods and models that analyze accident year data . Accident year is the year in which an insured claim, loss or loss expense occurred . The specific models and models used for the past several years are: paid and reported loss development methods .\n Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 53: \"The determination of management’s best estimate, like the preparation of the reserve analysis that supports it, involves considerable judgment . An inter-departmental committee that includes our actuarial management team reviews the results of each quarterly reserve analysis . Committee establishes management's best estimate of IBNR reserves, which is the amount that is included in each period's financial statements .\n Our ultimate loss experience could prove better or worse than our carried reserves reflect . Even if a change reflects a fundamental shift, the full extent of the change may not become evident until years later . We typically cannot quantify the precise impact of such factors on the adequacy of reserves prospectively or retrospectively . The four most significant of the key assumptions used by our actuarial staff and approved by management are: Emergence of loss and defense and cost containment expenses, also referred to as DCCE, on an accident year basis .\n Historical earned premiums, when adjusted to reflect common levels of product pricing and loss cost inflation, can serve as a proxy for historical exposures . Calendar year inflation trends for future paid losses and paid DCCE do not vary significantly from a stable, long-term average . Certain subsets of claims, such as high frequency, high severity, or mass tort claims, have the potential to distort patterns .\n Actual paid losses, reported losses and paid DCCE are virtually certain to differ from projections . Management does not closely monitor statistically insignificant differences between actual and projected data . The actual amount required to settle all outstanding insured claims, including IBNR claims, as of a financial statement date depends on stochastic, or random, elements as well as the systematic elements captured by our models .\n The table below provides standard errors and reserve ranges by major property casualty lines of business . See Liquidity and Capital Resources, Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Obligations and Reserves, Range of Reasonable Reserves . The table reflects our assessment of the most likely range within which each line’s actual unpaid loss and loss expenses may fall .\n The gross reserve balance for term and whole life policy reserves was $1.456 billion, or 49.2%, of total life policy and investment contract reserves at December 31, 2024 . The reserves also include a discount rate assumption that is based on upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument yields (market value discount rates)\n Some of our universal life insurance policies contain no-lapse guarantee provisions . The reserve balance for these contracts was $1.276 billion, or 43.1%, of total life policy and investment contract reserves, at December 31, 2024 . For these policies, we establish a reserve, or other additional liability, in addition to account balance .\n The application of our invested assets impairment policy resulted in write-downs of impaired securities intended to be sold that reduced our income before income taxes by less than $1 million in 2024, $4 million in 2023 and $5 million in 2022 . Write-downs represent noncash charges to income and are reported as investment losses .\n Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 57 . A credit loss is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis by comparing the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis . Noncredit losses are recognized in other comprehensive income as a change in unrealized gains and losses on investments . We provide information about valuations of our invested assets in Item 8, Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n Financial assets and liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as described in Item 8, Note 3 . Financial assets that fall within Level 1 and Level 2 are priced according to observable data from identical or similar securities that have traded in the marketplace .

Price increases and other underwriting efforts have helped offset losses that have elevated significantly since 2021 due to inflation effects discussed below . We believe future property casualty underwriting results will continue to benefit from price increases and our ongoing initiatives to improve pri\n Our statutory combined ratio was 92.9% in 2024 compared with 94.6% in 2023 and 97.7% in 2022 .

Field marketing representatives meet with local agencies to assess each risk, determine limits of insurance and establish appropriate terms and conditions . Field loss control, machinery and equipment and claims representatives conduct on-site inspections. Field claims representatives also assist underwriters by preparing full reports on their first-hand observations of risk quality.\n Our 5% increase in 2024 agency renewal written premiums included higher average pricing . Management continues to emphasize the importance of our agencies and underwriters assessing account quality to make careful decisions on a case-by-case basis whether to write new business or renew a policy . In 2024, our standard commercial lines policies averaged an estimated pricing change at a percentage near the low end of the high-single-digit range .\n Cincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 67: \"The average price increase was at a percentage in the high-single-digit range\" The 2024 increase of 5% for the commercial lines segment's agency renewal written premiums also included a higher level of insured exposures .
