    "item1": "Item 1 Business and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.\nCloud and License Business\n \nOur cloud and license business, which represented 86% and 84% of our total revenues in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:\n•\nCloud services and license support revenues, which include:\no\ncloud services revenues, which are earned by providing customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Services arrangements generally: are billed in advance of the cloud services being delivered; have durations of one to four years; are renewed at the customer’s option; and are recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time; and \no\nlicense support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally: priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; billed in advance of the support services being performed; renewed at the customer’s option; and recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year.\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n•\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise or other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are recognized over time. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above.\nProviding choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure software licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services revenues represented 43%, 37% and 32% of our total revenues during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nOur cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions, including the effects of inflation, tariffs and trade policy, geopolitical conditions and other macroeconomic factors on customer demand; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; customer satisfaction with our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:\n•\nexpected growth in our cloud services offerings; and\n•\ncontinued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license and license support offerings.\nWe believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business’ total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services.\nOur cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base, which we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year, which we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four fiscal quarterly periods. Our margin for this business may be adversely impacted due to increases in supply chain and energy costs, the impact of tariffs and trade policy and other factors.\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nHardware Business\n \nOur hardware business, which represented 5% and 6% of our total revenues in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware offerings, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to continue to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms.\nWe generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.\n \nOur quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners’ abilities to timely and cost-effectively manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the pricing and position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions, including the effects of inflation, tariffs and trade policy, geopolitical conditions and other macroeconomic factors on customer demand; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts; the effect of tariffs and other trade barriers on our costs, and our ability to pass such costs on to customers; the geographic locations of our customers; the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nServices Business\n \nOur services business, which represented 9% and 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the related services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\n \nAcquisitions\nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\ntechnologies. As compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy.\nWe believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets, among others, before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.\nInvestment in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC\nFrom time to time since 2017, we have made investments in Ampere, a related party entity, in the form of equity and convertible debt instruments. The total carrying value of our investments in Ampere, after accounting for losses under the equity method of accounting, was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n \nOur equity investments in Ampere represent an ownership interest of approximately 29% as of May 31, 2025 and 2024. We also own convertible debt investments in Ampere which, under the terms of an agreement with Ampere and other co-investors, will mature in June 2026 and are convertible into equity securities at the holder’s option under certain circumstances. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, we invested an aggregate of $341 million in convertible debt instruments issued by Ampere. In accordance with the terms of an agreement with other co-investors, we are also a counterparty to certain put (exercisable by a co-investor) and call (exercisable by Oracle) options at prices of approximately $500 million to $1.5 billion, respectively, to acquire additional equity interests in Ampere from our co-investors through January 2027.\nOn March 19, 2025, SoftBank Group Corp. announced that it had entered into an agreement with Ampere and its equity holders to acquire all of the equity interests of Ampere. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. When the Ampere Acquisition closes, we will cease to be an investor in Ampere. During the period prior to the closing of the Ampere Acquisition, the amount of our investments in Ampere could increase for a variety of reasons and we will continue to recognize our share of loss in Ampere’s net earnings until the closure of the acquisition.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of income taxes and non-marketable investments. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more discussion of our significant accounting policies.\nIncome Taxes\n \nJudgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate.\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments.\n \nWe account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, \nIncome Taxes\n, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.\nNon-Marketable Investments\nWe assess our non-marketable debt and equity investments for credit losses and impairment on a quarterly basis and as facts and circumstances change. Our analysis includes an assessment of various qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee’s historical financial results, current financial projections, rate of cash usage and assumptions regarding product acceptance and opportunity within the market. This analysis requires significant judgment in evaluating underlying factors. In some instances, investee specific information available to us to make this assessment may be limited or may be available on a delayed basis. If the investment is determined to be impaired, we adjust the carrying amount of such investment to its estimated fair value by recognizing a charge, which is included in non-operating income (expenses), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Estimating the fair value of an investment upon impairment involves a significant level of estimation, uncertainty and judgment. We may incur future losses due to impairments, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nResults of Operations\nPresentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information\n \nIn our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.\nIn addition, we discuss below the results of each of our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, \nSegment Reporting\n. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below.\nConsistent with our internal management reporting processes, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income (expenses), net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracticable to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2025 and 2024.\nConstant Currency Presentation\nOur international operations have provided, and are expected to continue to provide, a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2024, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2025 and 2024, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.13 million in fiscal 2025 (using 1.13 as the applicable average exchange rate for the period) and $1.09 million in fiscal 2024 (using 1.09 as the applicable average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2025 results using the fiscal 2024 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues between the periods compared. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nTotal Revenues and Operating Expenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPercent Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nActual\n\n\n \n\n\nConstant\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Revenues by Geography\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n36,339\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10%\n\n\n \n\n\n11%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n33,122\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMEA\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8%\n\n\n \n\n\n7%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,030\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,035\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3%\n\n\n \n\n\n5%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,809\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n57,399\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8%\n\n\n \n\n\n9%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n52,961\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Operating Expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39,721\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6%\n\n\n \n\n\n6%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37,608\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Operating Margin\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n17,678\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15%\n\n\n \n\n\n16%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,353\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Operating Margin %\n\n\n \n\n\n31%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Revenues by Geography\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n \n\n\n63%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMEA\n\n\n \n\n\n25%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n\n \n\n\n12%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Revenues by Business\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud and license\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n49,230\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11%\n\n\n \n\n\n11%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n44,464\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,936\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,066\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,233\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n-3%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,431\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n57,399\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8%\n\n\n \n\n\n9%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n52,961\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Revenues by Business\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud and license\n\n\n \n\n\n86%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n84%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n \n\n\n5%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\n\n \n\n\n9%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nComprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa \nTotal revenues increased by $4.4 billion in reported currency in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 due to a $4.8 billion increase in cloud and license revenues, partially offset by a $198 million decrease in services revenues and a $130 million decrease in hardware revenues, in each case during fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations of 1% in fiscal 2025 on total revenues, the constant currency increase in our cloud and license business revenues was primarily due to growth in our cloud services revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies and also renewed their related cloud contracts. In constant currency, applications cloud services and license support and infrastructure cloud services and license support contributed 26% and 74%, respectively, of the growth in cloud services and license support revenues in fiscal 2025. In our hardware business, the constant currency decrease in revenues in fiscal 2025 was due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies. In our services business, the constant currency decrease in revenues in fiscal 2025 was attributable to a decrease in revenues from each of our primary services offerings. The Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 74%, 19% and 7%, respectively, to the constant currency total revenue growth during fiscal 2025.\nTotal GAAP operating expenses increased by $2.1 billion in reported currency in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024. The increase in GAAP operating expenses in reported currency during fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 was primarily due to a $2.1 billion increase in cloud services and license support expenses primarily due to higher infrastructure expenses and higher employee-related expenses, including higher expenses relating to stock-based compensation, that were incurred to support the growth in our cloud services revenues; a $945 million increase in research and development expenses primarily due to an $813 million increase in employee-related expenses, including higher stock-based compensation expenses, and a $112 million increase in infrastructure expenses; a $377 million increase in sales and marketing expenses; and a $54 million increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including higher stock-based compensation expenses. These increases in GAAP operating expenses in reported currency during fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 were partially offset by a $703 million decrease in expenses for the amortization of intangible assets as certain of our assets were fully amortized; a $249 million decrease in services expenses primarily due to decreases in external contractor and employee-related expenses; a $239 million decrease in acquisition related and other expenses due to lower asset impairment and litigation-related charges; a $109 million decrease in hardware expenses due to lower hardware product and support costs; and a $105 million decrease in restructuring expenses.\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nIn constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 due to higher revenues.\nSupplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\nTo supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future.\n \nOur operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expenses, including stock-based compensation, that affected our GAAP net income:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization of intangible assets\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,307\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,010\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition related and other\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n314\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n299\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n404\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based compensation, operating segments\n(4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,597\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,382\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based compensation, R&D and G&A\n(4)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,077\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,592\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax effects\n(5)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2,514\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2,459\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,841\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,243\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nRepresents the amortization of intangible assets, all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions.

Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one to four years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of applications and infrastructure software license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel- and infrastructure-related and include the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings and marketing program costs.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPercent Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nActual\n\n\n \n\n\nConstant\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud and License Revenues\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n31,714\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12%\n\n\n \n\n\n13%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n28,196\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMEA\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,773\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9%\n\n\n \n\n\n9%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,771\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,743\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4%\n\n\n \n\n\n6%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,497\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49,230\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11%\n\n\n \n\n\n11%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44,464\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenses\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud services and license support\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,827\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23%\n\n\n \n\n\n24%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,783\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales and marketing\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,473\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4%\n\n\n \n\n\n5%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,167\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal expenses\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18,300\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15%\n\n\n \n\n\n15%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15,950\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Margin\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n30,930\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8%\n\n\n \n\n\n9%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n28,514\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Margin %\n\n\n \n\n\n63%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Revenues by Geography\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n \n\n\n64%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMEA\n\n\n \n\n\n24%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n\n \n\n\n12%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues by Offerings\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud services\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n24,506\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24%\n\n\n \n\n\n24%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n19,774\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense support\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19,523\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0%\n\n\n \n\n\n0%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19,609\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud license and on-premise license\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,201\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2%\n\n\n \n\n\n3%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,081\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n49,230\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11%\n\n\n \n\n\n11%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n44,464\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud Services and License Support Revenues by Ecosystem\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications cloud services and license support\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n19,383\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7%\n\n\n \n\n\n7%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n18,172\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure cloud services and license support\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,646\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16%\n\n\n \n\n\n17%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21,211\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal cloud services and license support revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n44,029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12%\n\n\n \n\n\n12%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n39,383\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nExcludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations.

These increases were partially offset by an $86 million decrease in license support revenues in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024. In constant currency, applications cloud services and license support and infrastructure cloud services and license support contributed 26% and 74%, respectively, of the growth in cloud services and license support revenues in fiscal 2025. The Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 75%, 19% and 6%, respectively, to the constant currency revenue growth for this business during fiscal 2025.\nTotal cloud and license business’ expenses increased by $2.4 billion in reported currency in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024. Excluding the favorable effects of currency rate fluctuations of less than 1% in fiscal 2025, the constant currency increase in expenses in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 was primarily due to a $1.6 billion increase in infrastructure expenses; a $359 million increase in employee-related expenses for employees engaged in cloud services delivery; and a $350 million increase in sales and marketing expenses to support the increase in our cloud services revenues. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods, and we expect this trend to continue during fiscal 2026 as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand.\nExcluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin increased in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 due to increases in total revenues for this business. Total margin as a percentage of revenues in constant currency decreased in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 due to an increase in total expenses for this business.\nHardware Business\nOur hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage and industry-specific hardware offerings. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products with eligible support contracts; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel-related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPercent Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nActual\n\n\n \n\n\nConstant\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware Revenues\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,441\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n-3%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,494\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMEA\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n893\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-3%\n\n\n \n\n\n-3%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n921\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n602\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-8%\n\n\n \n\n\n-7%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n651\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,936\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n-4%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,066\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenses\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware products and support\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n742\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-13%\n\n\n \n\n\n-12%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n855\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales and marketing\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n276\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-7%\n\n\n \n\n\n-6%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n296\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal expenses\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,018\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-12%\n\n\n \n\n\n-11%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,151\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Margin\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,918\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0%\n\n\n \n\n\n1%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,915\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Margin %\n\n\n \n\n\n65%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Revenues by Geography\n:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n \n\n\n49%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMEA\n\n\n \n\n\n30%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia Pacific\n\n\n \n\n\n21%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nExcludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations.

Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency rate fluctuations of less than 1% in fiscal 2025, the decrease in hardware revenues was primarily due to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Geographically, we experienced constant currency hardware revenue declines in all regions in fiscal 2025.\nTotal hardware expenses decreased by $133 million in reported currency in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024. The decrease in hardware expenses aligned with lower hardware revenues. Excluding the favorable currency rate fluctuations effect of 1% in fiscal 2025, the constant currency decrease in hardware expenses during fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 was due to a $106 million decrease in hardware product and support costs and an $18 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses.\nIn constant currency, our hardware business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 due to lower total expenses for this business.\nServices Business\nOur services offerings are designed to help maximize the performance of customer investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies and include our consulting services and advanced customer services offerings.

These contributors to the increase in non-operating income (expenses), net were partially offset by a $77 million decrease in other income, net, which was primarily attributable to lower gains associated with an investment portfolio that we held for our employee deferred compensation plan, and for which an equal and offsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n:\n \n \n \nOur effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned and losses incurred in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax-related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPercent Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nActual\n\n\n \n\n\nConstant\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,717\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35%\n\n\n \n\n\n36%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,274\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n12.1%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.9%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 primarily due to an unfavorable jurisdictional mix of earnings of $380 million, the absence of the realization of a one-time tax attribute of $238 million, higher income before provision for income taxes of $195 million and the absence of the revaluation benefit of net deferred tax assets due to a change in tax rate of $105 million, partially offset by a combination of the absence of changes in unrecognized tax benefits of $233 million and an increase in tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $223 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs of May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking capital\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(8,064\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n-10%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(8,990\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n11,203\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10,661\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWorking capital\n:\n   The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2025 in comparison to May 31, 2024 was primarily due to favorable impacts from net income and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, net of issuance costs, of $13.9 billion (refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information) during fiscal 2025. This increase was partially offset by $21.2 billion of cash used for capital expenditures; $4.9 billion of long-term borrowings that were reclassified to current liabilities; $4.7 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders; $600 million of cash used for repurchases of our common stock; $294 million of cash used for purchases, net of sales and maturities of non-current investments; and $247 million of net cash used for our employee stock programs during fiscal 2025. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n:\n \n  Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Customers for these cloud services and license support agreements are generally billed in advance of services being provided. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also generate cash from the sales of new licenses, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are typically for employee-related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $2.1 billion in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 primarily due to higher net income adjusted for certain non-cash charges, partially offset by certain cash unfavorable working capital changes, net.\nCash flows from investing activities\n:\n   The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our investments in capital assets primarily to support the growth in our cloud and license business and acquisitions, purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities and other instruments.\nNet cash used for investing activities increased by $14.4 billion in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 primarily due to the increase in capital expenditures.\nCash flows from financing activities\n:\n   The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.\n \nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.1 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to the net cash used for financing activities of $10.6 billion in fiscal 2024. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2025 relative to fiscal 2024 was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, net of issuance costs, of $13.9 billion; higher issuances of commercial paper notes of $2.1 billion, net of repayments; lower net cash used for our employee stock programs of $1.1 billion; higher net cash provided by other financing activities of $1.1 billion; and lower net cash used for repurchases of common stock of $602 million. These increases were partially offset by higher scheduled repayments of borrowings of $6.7 billion and higher dividend payments of $352 million. Further, during fiscal 2025, we refinanced our term loan credit agreement that we entered into in fiscal 2023 (Term Loan Credit Agreement), which resulted in no net impact on financing cash flows for the period reported.\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nFree cash flow\n:\n   To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with that of our competitors.

In June 2025, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 24, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 10, 2025. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board.\nTerm Loan Credit Agreements\n:\n   On June 10, 2024, we terminated the Term Loan Credit Agreement and repaid the principal amount outstanding together with interest accrued up to the date of repayment. Simultaneously, we borrowed up to the maximum commitment amount of $5.6 billion pursuant to a term loan credit agreement (Term Loan Credit Agreement 2) executed on the same date. In fiscal 2025, we made scheduled repayments totaling $211 million of the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our borrowings, including the repayment terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2. Any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 will become fully due and payable on August 16, 2027, unless the termination date of the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 is extended.\nSenior Notes\n:   \nDuring fiscal 2025, we issued $14.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes composed of the following:\n•\n$500 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due August 2028;\n•\n$1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.80% senior notes due August 2028;\n•\n$1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% senior notes due September 2029;\n•\n$1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due February 2032;\n•\n$1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.70% senior notes due September 2034;\n•\n$1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due August 2035;\n•\n$1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due September 2054;\n•\n$1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% senior notes due August 2055;\n•\n$1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.50% senior notes due September 2064; and\n•\n$1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due August 2065.\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nWe issued the senior notes to repay all or a portion of senior notes due between November 2024 and July 2026, and to pay accrued interest and any related premiums, fees and expenses in connection therewith; to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on borrowings under our Term Loan Credit Agreement 2; to repay all or a portion of commercial paper notes outstanding; and to use any remaining net proceeds from the borrowing for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of other indebtedness and future acquisitions. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\n:\n   Our Board has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of May 31, 2025, approximately $6.4 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 3.9 million shares for $600 million, 10.6 million shares for $1.2 billion and 17.0 million shares for $1.3 billion in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.\nContractual Obligations\n:\n \nOur largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2025 consisted of:\n•\nprincipal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that were included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments;\n•\nroutine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that were included in our consolidated balance sheet;\n•\nlease liabilities that were included in our consolidated balance sheet; \n•\nlease commitments that have not yet commenced and were not included in our consolidated balance sheet; and\n•\nother contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.\nIn addition, as of May 31, 2025, we had $12.0 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2026. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and many aspects are out of our control. Notes 6, 9, 12 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report include additional information regarding our most material contractual obligations and contingencies.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations and our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.\nStock-Based Awards\nOur stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.\nWe recognize that stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2022 has been an annualized rate of 1.7% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nstock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock-based awards vest and, if applicable, are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options as of May 31, 2025, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has partially offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2025, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 5.6%.\nDuring fiscal 2025, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of RSUs with a value of $5 million or greater. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2025 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee.\nStock-based awards activity from June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2025 is summarized as follows (shares in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based awards outstanding as of May 31, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n225\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based awards granted and assumed\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n168\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based awards vested and issued and, if applicable, exercised\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(209\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeitures, cancellations and other, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(26\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based awards outstanding as of May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n158\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n48\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnualized stock repurchases\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(11\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares outstanding as of May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,807\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,743\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding as of May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n5.6%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal in the money stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2025) as a percent of shares outstanding as of May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n5.6%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n1.7%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n1.3%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nItem 7A.\tQuantitative and Qualitat\nive Disclosures About Market Risk\nEquity Price Risk\nNon-Marketable Equity and Convertible Debt Investments\nOur non-marketable equity and convertible debt investments totaled $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our non-marketable equity investments in privately owned companies not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairment. Our investments accounted for under the equity method generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover. The timing and amounts of changes in fair values of our non-marketable equity investments depend on factors beyond our control, including the perceived and actual performance of the companies in which we invest. For additional disclosure regarding the impact to our quarterly results of operations from investment volatility, please refer to",
    "item1a": "Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nAnnual Report. For additional details on our non-marketable investments, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCurrency Risk\n \nForeign Currency Translation Risk\n \nAs described under “Constant Currency Presentation” above, our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and expenses that we report in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our consolidated revenues and expenses are affected and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, earnings and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of, each reporting period. For example, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar will reduce the reported amount of our foreign subsidiaries' cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables, deferred revenues, current and non-current liabilities, total revenues and total expenses that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for, and as of the end of, each reporting period.\nForeign Currency Transaction Risk\n \nWe transact business in various foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exposures primarily arise from various intercompany transactions. Our principal currency exposures include the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen and Saudi Riyal. We have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset the risks that arise from the aforementioned transactions. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts for currencies in which we have significant exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration and we do not use them for trading purposes.\nRealized gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, including costs incurred to enter into these foreign currency forward contracts, are included in non-operating income (expenses), net in our consolidated financial statements. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Furthermore, as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, in which the amounts and timing are unknown. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our foreign currency forward contracts.\nSensitivity Analysis\nThe following table sets forth the hypothetical potential losses that we consider to be the most material to the reported fair values and/or future earnings of our foreign currency influenced holdings, prior to any income tax effects, resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates as of or for the reporting periods below:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nHypothetical Change\n\n\n \n\n\nImpact\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign currency risk:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n10% decrease in foreign exchange rates\n\n\n \n\n\nEarnings\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,379\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,259\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and trade receivables, net\n\n\n \n\n\n10% decrease in foreign exchange rates\n\n\n \n\n\nFair values\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(1,788\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(1,592\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nItem 8.\tFinancial Statemen\nts and Supplementary Data\nThe response to this item is submitted as a separate section of this Annual Report. See Part IV, Item 15.\nItem 9.\tChanges In and Disagreements with Acco\nuntants on Accounting and\n \nFinancial Disclosure\nNone.\n \nItem 9A.\n \nControl\ns and Procedures\n \nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e).\n \nBased on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Principal Executive and Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025 based on the guidelines established in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 framework. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n \nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2025. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the F&A Committee.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n \nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nItem 9B\n.\tOther Information\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nDuring the quarter ended May 31, 2025, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as those terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9C\n.\tDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNot applicable.\n \n \n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nPART \nIII\nItem 10.\tDirectors, Executive Of\nficers and Corporate Governance\nPursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K, the information required by this item relating to our executive officers is included under the caption “Information About Our Executive Officers” in Part I of this Annual Report.\nThe other information required by this Item 10 is incorporated herein by reference from the information contained in our Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC in connection with the solicitation of proxies for our 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (2025 Proxy Statement).\nItem 11.\tExecuti\nve Compensation\nThe information required by this Item 11 is incorporated herein by reference from the information to be contained in our 2025 Proxy Statement.\nItem 12.\tSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Ow\nners and Management\n \nand Related Stockholder Matters\nThe information required by this Item 12 is incorporated herein by reference from the information to be contained in our 2025 Proxy Statement.\nItem 13.\tCertain Relationships and Relate\nd Transactions, and Director\n \nIndependence\nThe information required by this Item 13 is incorporated herein by reference from the information to be contained in our 2025 Proxy Statement.\nItem 14.\tPrincipal Accou\nntant Fees and Services\nThe information required by this Item 14 is incorporated herein by reference from the information to be contained in our 2025 Proxy Statement.\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nPAR\nT IV\nItem 15.\tExhibits and Fin\nancial Statement Schedules\n(a)\n1.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated June 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nUncertain Tax Positions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the matter\n\n\n \n\n\nAs discussed in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes uncertain tax positions and measures unrecognized tax benefits related to various domestic and foreign matters. The Company uses significant judgment in the accounting for uncertain tax positions related to certain intercompany transfer prices and calculations, including the interpretation and application of tax laws and legal rulings in various jurisdictions.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions was complex, involved significant judgment, and was based on interpretations and application of tax laws and legal rulings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit\n\n\n \n\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over management’s process to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions related to certain intercompany transfer prices and calculations, including ongoing monitoring activities, and management’s process to measure the benefit of those tax positions.\nTo test management’s assessment of these uncertain tax positions, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis which detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter professionals in assessing the technical merits of these positions and used our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nSan Jose, California\nJune 18, 2025\n \n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Oracle Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Oracle Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Oracle Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated June 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJune 18, 2025\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nORACLE CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED

products and services that substantially address enterprise information technology (IT) needs, including applications and infrastructure technologies. We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments. Oracle Cloud Applications and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and enhancements during the term of the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in the state of Delaware.\nBasis of Financial Statements\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle’s stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of non-operating income (expenses), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect revenue, income from operations or net income.\nIn fiscal 2025, we \nadopted\n Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n (ASU 2023-07), which did \nno\nt have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2025.\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and networking equipment and increased the estimate of the useful lives from \nfive years\n to \nsix years\n, effective at the beginning of fiscal 2025. Based on the carrying value of our servers and networking equipment as of May 31, 2024, this change in accounting estimate decreased our total operating expenses by $\n733\n million and increased our net income by $\n573\n million, or $\n0.21\n per basic and $\n0.20\n per diluted share, during fiscal 2025.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and increased the estimate of the useful lives from \nfour years\n to \nfive years\n effective at the beginning of fiscal 2023. Based on the carrying value of our servers as of May 31, 2022, this change in accounting estimate decreased our total operating expenses by $\n434\n million during fiscal 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\n \nOur sources of revenues include:\n•\ncloud and license revenues, which include: cloud services revenues; cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which typically represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and on-premise IT environments; and license support revenues;\n•\nhardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products, including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers and storage products, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and \n•\nservices revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting and advanced customer services.\nCloud services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud Services offerings, which deliver applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage, upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option.\n \nLicense support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by our customers at their option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customers elect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually.\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage and industry-specific hardware. Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees.\nOur services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to, among others, deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade and secure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Our advanced customer services are designed to provide supplemental support services, performance services and higher availability for Oracle products and services.\n \n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n (ASC 606) as a single standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of our cloud, license, hardware and services arrangements and generally require revenues to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services provided to our customers, reflecting the amount of consideration we expect to receive for those goods or services. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps:\n•\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n•\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n•\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n•\nallocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and \n•\nrecognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied.\nOur customers that contract with us for the provision of cloud services, software, hardware or other services include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and our channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets when revenues are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices for cloud license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product. Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance. Cloud applications and cloud infrastructure contracts are generally invoiced annually, quarterly or monthly in advance. Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed. Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division. The transaction price for a contract that is financed through our Oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating income (expenses), net within our consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed.\nOur revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant. Our arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nRevenue Recognition for Cloud Services\nRevenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the cloud services are delivered, beginning on the date our service is made available to a customer. We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period. Revenues from cloud services that are provided on a consumption basis, such as metered services, are generally recognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer.\n \n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nRevenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support\nOracle’s primary performance obligations with respect to license support contracts and hardware support contracts are to provide customers with technical support as needed and unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period, if and when they are available, and hardware product repairs, as applicable. Oracle is obligated to make the license and hardware support services available continuously throughout the contract period. Therefore, revenues for license support contracts and hardware support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods that the support services are provided.\nRevenue Recognition for Cloud Licenses and On-Premise Licenses\nRevenues from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. For usage-based royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount, the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer.\nRevenue Recognition for Hardware Products\nThe hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer.\nRevenue Recognition for Services\n \nServices revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. Revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion. Revenues for consumption-based services are generally recognized as the services are performed.\nAllocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations\n \nMany of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally not combined. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract.\n \nWe use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues.\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations from Contracts with Customers\nTrade receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2025 and 2024. The revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2025 and 2024 that were included in the opening deferred revenues balances as of May 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $\n9.3\n billion and $\n9.0\n billion, respectively. Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023.\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have been issued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. We have elected the optional exemption to not disclose the variable consideration for contracts in which the variable consideration expected to be received over the duration of the contract is allocated entirely to the wholly unsatisfied performance obligations. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors and the timing of booking of large contracts. In each fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity, other than the impact of booking of large contracts, and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. These seasonal impacts and the timing of booking of large contracts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time and, combined with foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2025, our remaining performance obligations were $\n137.8\n billion, of which we expect to recognize approximately \n33\n% as revenues over the next \ntwelve months\n, \n41\n% over the subsequent month \n13 to month 36\n, \n23\n% over the subsequent month \n37 to month 60\n and the remainder thereafter.\nSales of Financing Receivables\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, $\n1.6\n billion, $\n1.4\n billion and $\n2.0\n billion, respectively, of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, \nBusiness Combinations\n (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize goodwill separately from the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability\n \n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nfor costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred.\nFor a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax-related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the business acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination, whichever comes first, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nMarketable and Non-Marketable Investments\n \nIn accordance with ASC 320, \nInvestments—Debt Securities\n, and based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify substantially all of our marketable debt securities investments as available-for-sale. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses, if any, determined to be related to credit losses, which we record within non-operating income (expenses), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required. All of our marketable debt securities investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nInvestments in equity securities, other than any equity method investments, are generally recorded at their fair values, if the fair values are readily determinable. Non-marketable equity securities for which the fair values are not readily determinable and where we do not have control of, nor significant influence in, the investee are recorded at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer with any gains or losses recorded as a component of non-operating income (expenses), net as of and for each reporting period. For investments through which we have significant influence in, but not control of, the investee, we account for such investments pursuant to the equity method of accounting whereby we record our proportionate share of the investee’s earnings or losses; amortization of differences between our investment basis and underlying equity in net assets of the investee, excluding the component representing goodwill; and impairment, if any, as a component of non-operating income (expenses), net for each reporting period.\nO\nur investments in marketable debt and equity securities totaled $\n417\n million and $\n207\n million as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOur non-marketable debt investments and equity securities and related instruments totaled $\n2.1\n billion and $\n2.0\n billion as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and are included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are subject to periodic credit losses and impairment reviews. The majority of the non-marketable debt and equity investments held as of these dates were with Ampere Computing Holdings LLC (Ampere), a related party entity in which we have an ownership interest of approximately \n29\n% as of May 31, 2025 and 2024. \nOur debt investments in Ampere are in the form of convertible debt which, under the terms of an\n \n\n\n74\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nagreement \nwith Ampere and other co-investors, will mature in \nJune 2026\n and are convertible into equity securities at the holder’s option under certain circumstances. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025, we invested an aggregate of $\n341\n million in convertible debt instruments issued by Ampere. We follow the equity method of accounting for our investment in Ampere and our share of loss under the equity method of accounting is recorded in the non-operating income (expenses), net line item in our consolidated statements of operations. The total carrying value of our investments in Ampere after accounting for losses under the equity method of accounting was $\n1.6\n billion and $\n1.5\n billion as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. In accordance with the terms of an agreement with other co-investors, we are also a counterparty to certain put (exercisable by a co-investor) and call (exercisable by Oracle) options at prices of approximately $\n500\n million to $\n1.5\n billion, respectively, to acquire additional equity interests in Ampere from our co-investors through \nJanuary 2027\n. On March 19, 2025, SoftBank Group Corp. announced that it had entered into an agreement with Ampere and its equity holders to acquire all of the equity interests of Ampere (the Ampere Acquisition). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. When the Ampere Acquisition closes, we will cease to be an investor in Ampere. During the period prior to the closing of the Ampere Acquisition, we will continue to recognize our share of loss in Ampere’s net earnings until the closure of the \nacquisition\n.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 820, \nFair Value Measurement \n(ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments.\n \nThe additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 3.\n \nAllowances for Credit Losses\n \nWe record allowances for credit losses based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, collection history and current and expected future economic conditions. We write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\n \nFinancial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives, trade receivables and non-marketable investments. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities. Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty credit-related losses in these contracts is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of these contracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2025, 2024 or 2023. Refer to “Marketable and Non-Marketable Investments” above for additional information on our non-marketable investments.\nWe outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of the substantial majority of our hardware products that we sell to our customers as well as use internally to deliver our cloud services to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. Further, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our cloud and license and hardware businesses.\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons. Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $\n303\n million and $\n334\n million as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOther Receivables\n \nOther receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $\n855\n million and $\n821\n million as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nDeferred Sales Commissions\nWe defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud, license support and hardware support contract. Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we estimate to be four years. We determine the period of benefit by taking into consideration the historical and expected durations of our customer contracts, the expected useful lives of our technologies and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts relating to certain of our cloud-based arrangements are generally deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period, which is generally one to three years. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and asset balances for deferred sales commissions are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from \none\n to \n40\n years. Finance lease Right-of-Use (ROU) assets are amortized over the lease term. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms, as appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable at an appropriate asset or asset group level. We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2025, 2024 or 2023.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are itemized in Note 5 belo\nw and are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from \none\n to \n10 years\n. At least annually, we assess the useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets and may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a shorter amortization period is more reflective of the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows.\n \nThe \ncarrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When goodwill is assessed for impairment, we have the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment (optional assessment) prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test. Should the optional assessment be used for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors considered for a reporting unit include: cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; entity specific factors;\n \n\n\n76\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nindustry \nand market considerations; macroeconomic conditions; and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates, judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis; the discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis; future economic and market conditions; and market comparables of peer companies, among others. If, as per the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting unit. \nOur most recent goodwill impairment analysis was performed on March 1, 2025 and did \nno\nt result in a goodwill impairment charge. We did not recognize impairment charges in fiscal 2024 or 2023.\nRecoverability of finite lived intangible assets is evaluated by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is evaluated by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2025, 2024 or 2023.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDuring fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, we used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815,\n Derivatives and Hedging \n(ASC 815), which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of each reporting date. ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives’ fair values be recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as certain types of hedges).\n \nThe accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding earnings offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, during each reporting period, we record the change in fair value of the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated balance sheets and the change is reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings.\nLeases\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 842, \nLeases\n (ASC 842), in accounting for our leases. Accordingly, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments, because the implicit rate of the lease is generally not known. ROU assets related to our leases are measured at lease inception based on the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any prepaid lease payments and less any lease incentives. Our lease terms that are used in determining our lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. For operating leases, we generally recognize the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and classify both the ROU assets amortization and imputed interest as operating expenses. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are classified as operating expense and imputed interest is classified as interest expense. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and in such cases, we generally account for the components as a single lease component. We do not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for any lease with an original lease term of less than one year. Abandoned operating leases are accounted for as ROU asset impairment charges pursuant to ASC 842.\n\n\n77\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nROU assets related to operating and finance leases are included in other non-current assets and property, plant and equipment, net, respectively; short-term operating and finance lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities; and long-term operating and finance lease liabilities are included in operating lease liabilities and other non-current liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.\n \nCash flow movements related to operating lease activities are included in operating cash flows and those related to finance leases are included in operating cash flows for the portion related to interest and in financing cash flows for the portion related to principal in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023. Note 9 belo\nw provides additional information regarding our leases.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. Descriptions of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination are provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 15 b\nelow provides additional information regarding certain of our legal contingencies.\nForeign Currency\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local country’s currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCL in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income (expenses), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $\n147\n million, $\n228\n million and $\n249\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\n \nWe account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of service-based restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, service-based employee stock options, performance-based stock options (PSOs) and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with ASC 718, \nCompensation\n—\nStock Compensation,\n which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.\n \nFor our service-based stock awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally \nfour years\n.\nFor our PSOs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for tranches that are probable of achievement over the longer of the (a) estimated implicit service period for performance-metric achievement or (b) derived service period for market-based metric achievement applicable for each tranche. During our interim and annual reporting periods, stock-based compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest, or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods, may cause the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of shares that are expected to vest are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSO tranche on a cumulative catch-up basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered. Changes in estimates of the implicit service periods are recognized prospectively.\n \n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nWe record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in each reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established and recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for income taxes in such period. Note 11 \nbelow provides additional information regarding our stock-based compensation plans and related expenses.\n \nResearch and Development Costs and Software Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are generally expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, \nResearch and Development\n.

The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations.\nA description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome Taxes\n:\n In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n (ASU 2023-09), which enhances the disclosures required for income taxes in our annual consolidated financial statements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for us for our annual reporting for fiscal 2026 on a prospective basis. Both early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2023-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Statement\n:\n In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nIncome Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n (ASU 2024-03) and also issued subsequent guidance clarifying the effective date of the initial guidance (collectively, Subtopic 220-40), which enhances the disclosures required for expense disaggregation in our annual and interim consolidated financial statements. This guidance is effective for us for our annual reporting for fiscal 2028 and for interim period reporting beginning in fiscal 2029 on a prospective basis. Both early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of Subtopic 220-40 on our consolidated financial statements.\n2.\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nCash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, including time deposits, and money market funds with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than 90 days.\nThe amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2025 and 2024. We use the specific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realized gains and losses were insignificant for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023.

Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.\nRestricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2025 and 2024 and our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial.\n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n3.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \nWe perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.\n \nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n \n•\nLevel 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n•\nLevel 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or \n•\nLevel 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nOur assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above):\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFair Value Measurements\nUsing Input Types\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFair Value Measurements\nUsing Input Types\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\nLevel 1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLevel 2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLevel 1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLevel 2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney market funds\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,220\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,220\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,620\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,620\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime deposits and other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n59\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n526\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n585\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n48\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n262\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n310\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative financial instruments\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n179\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n179\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,279\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n580\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,859\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,668\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n441\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,109\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiabilities:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative financial instruments\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n26\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n26\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n96\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n96\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nOur valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our instruments that were classified as Level 1 in the table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments that exist.

due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes). Principal and unamortized discount/issuance costs for the July 2025 Notes in the table above were calculated using foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable, as of May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, respectively. The July 2025 Notes are registered and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\n(2)\nIn fiscal 2018 we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of $\n871\n million based on LIBOR. The effective interest rates as of May 31, 2025 and 2024 after consideration of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements were \n7.77\n% and \n8.76\n%, respectively, for the July 2025 Notes. Refer to Note 1 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges.\n(3)\nIn fiscal 2023, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our $\n4.7\n billion of floating-rate borrowings pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement (defined below) until its repayment and subsequently, borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 (defined below) for the same amount to fixed-rate borrowings with a fixed annual interest rate of \n3.07\n%, plus a margin depending on the credit rating assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt, as further discussed below. The effective interest rates after consideration of the interest rate swap agreements were \n4.74\n% for each of fiscal 2025 for borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 (defined below) and fiscal 2024 for borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 1 for a description of our accounting for cash flow hedges.\n(4)\nIn fiscal 2025, we issued $\n14.0\n billion of senior notes and intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to repay all or a portion of senior notes due between November 2024 and July 2026, and to pay accrued interest and any related premiums, fees and expenses in connection therewith; to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 (defined below); to repay all or a portion of commercial paper notes outstanding; and to use any remaining net proceeds from the borrowing for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of other indebtedness and future acquisitions. The interest is payable semi-annually for the fixed-rate senior notes and quarterly for the floating-rate senior notes. We may redeem some or all of the fixed-rate senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.\nFuture principal payments (adjusted for the effects of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements associated with the July 2025 Notes) for all of our borrowings at May 31, 2025 were as follows (in millions):\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2026\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,309\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,743\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,145\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2030\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,250\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n60,500\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n92,947\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nSenior Notes\nInterest is payable semi-annually for the senior notes listed in the above table, except for the Euro Notes for which interest is payable annually and the floating-rate senior notes for which interest is payable quarterly. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances except for the floating-rate senior notes, which may not be redeemed prior to their maturity.\nThe senior notes rank pari passu with all existing and future notes issued pursuant to our commercial paper program (see additional discussion regarding our commercial paper program below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation, including the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2, each as defined and described further below. All existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the senior notes and Commercial Paper Notes (defined below), borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 (defined below) and any future borrowings pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with all debt-related covenants at May 31, 2025.\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured $\n6.0\n billion, \nfive-year\n revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility) to be used for our working capital purposes and for other general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Revolving Credit Agreement, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the Revolving Facility during the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement. All amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement will become due on \nMarch 8, 2027\n, unless the commitments are terminated earlier either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events). Interest is based on either (a) a Term SOFR-based formula plus a margin of \n87.5\n basis points to \n150.0\n basis points, depending on the credit rating assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt, or (b) a Base Rate formula plus a margin up to \n50.0\n basis points, depending on the same such credit rating, each as set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of May 31, 2025 and 2024, we did \nno\nt have any outstanding borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nTerm Loan Credit Agreements\nDuring fiscal 2023, pursuant to a term loan credit agreement (Term Loan Credit Agreement) providing for an aggregate term loan commitment of $\n5.6\n billion, we borrowed $\n4.7\n billion under term loan 1 facility (Term Loan 1 Facility) and $\n960\n million under term loan 2 facility (Term Loan 2 Facility and, together with the Term Loan 1 Facility, the Term Loan Facilities).\nThe Term Loan Credit Agreement provided for repayment of borrowings under the Term Loan Facilities as follows:\n•\nan amount equal to the amount borrowed reduced by any prepayments multiplied by \n1.25\n% on \nSeptember 30, 2024\n and quarterly thereafter until \nJune 30, 2026\n;\n•\nan amount equal to the amount borrowed reduced by any prepayments multiplied by \n2.50\n% on \nSeptember 30, 2026\n and quarterly thereafter until \nJune 30, 2027\n; and\n•\nany remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan 1 Facility will become fully due and payable on \nAugust 16, 2027\n and any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan 2 Facility will become fully due and payable on \nAugust 16, 2025\n (subject to any extension of the Term Loan 2 Facility termination date, as set out below), unless the outstanding loans are prepaid earlier at the request of Oracle or accelerated by the lenders if an event of default occurs.\nInterest was based on either (a) a Term SOFR-based formula plus a margin of \n147.5\n basis points to \n197.5\n basis points, depending on the credit rating assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt, or (b) a Base Rate formula plus a margin of \n47.5\n basis points to \n97.5\n basis points, depending on the same such credit rating, each as set forth in the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nWe were in compliance with all covenants under the Term Loan Credit Agreement as of May 31, 2024.\n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nOn June 10, 2024, we terminated our Term Loan Credit Agreement and repaid the principal amount outstanding together with interest accrued up to the date of repayment. Simultaneously, we borrowed up to the maximum commitment amount of $\n5.6\n billion pursuant to a term loan credit agreement (Term Loan Credit Agreement 2) executed on the same date. The critical terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 are similar to the critical terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, except for terms related to the interest, the consolidation of two term loan facilities under Term Loan Credit Agreement into a single facility under the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 and the options to extend the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2. Interest is based on either (a) a Term SOFR-based formula plus a margin of \n112.5\n basis points to \n162.5\n basis points, depending on the credit rating assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt, or (b) a Base Rate formula plus a margin of \n12.5\n basis points to \n62.5\n basis points, depending on the same such credit rating, each as set forth in the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2.\nThe Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 provides for repayment of borrowing as follows:\n•\nan amount equal to the amount borrowed reduced by any prepayments multiplied by \n1.25\n% on \nSeptember 30, 2024\n and quarterly thereafter until \nJune 30, 2026\n;\n•\nan amount equal to the amount borrowed reduced by any prepayments multiplied by \n2.50\n% on \nSeptember 30, 2026 \nand quarterly thereafter until \nJune 30, 2027\n; and\n•\nany remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 will become fully due and payable on \nAugust 16, 2027\n (subject to any extension of the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 termination date, as set out below), unless the outstanding loans are prepaid earlier at the request of Oracle or accelerated by the lenders if an event of default occurs.\nThe termination date of the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 may be extended at our sole option by up to \n2\n years. The termination date of the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 may also be further extended at each lender’s option by up to \n2\n years.\nWe were in compliance with all covenants under the Term Loan Credit Agreement 2 as of May 31, 2025.\nCommercial Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes\nOur existing $\n6.0\n billion commercial paper program allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes (Commercial Paper Notes) pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws pursuant to dealer agreements with various banks and an Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas.\nThere were $\n2.3\n billion and $\n401\n million of outstanding Commercial Paper Notes as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes.\n7.\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES\nFiscal 2024 Oracle Restructuring Plan\nDuring fiscal 2024, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2024 Restructuring Plan). In fiscal 2025, our management supplemented the 2024 Restructuring Plan to reflect additional actions that we expected to take. Restructuring costs associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan were recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they were incurred.

Certain routine arrangements that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way or are for terms of less than one year.\n \nAs of May 31, 2025, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows (in millions):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2026\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n947\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n401\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n267\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n262\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2030\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n122\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n227\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,226\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAs described in Note 6 above, as of May 31, 2025 we have senior notes and other borrowings that mature at various future dates and derivative financial instruments outstanding that we leverage to manage certain risks and exposures.\nGuarantees\n \nOur cloud, license and hardware sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.\nOur \nOracle Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreement during the service period.

As of May 31, 2025, approximately $\n6.4\n billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased \n3.9\n million shares for $\n600\n million, \n10.6\n million shares for $\n1.2\n billion and \n17.0\n million shares for $\n1.3\n billion in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, under the stock repurchase program.\nOur stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.\nDividends on Common Stock\nDuring fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Board declared cash dividends of\n $\n1.70\n, $\n1.60\n and $\n1.36\n per share of our outstanding common stock, respectively, which we paid during the same period.\nIn June 2025, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend\n of $\n0.50\n per\n share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on \nJuly 24, 2025\n to stockholders of record as of the close of business on \nJuly 10, 2025\n. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of the Board.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table summarizes, as of each balance sheet date, the components of our AOCL, net of income taxes:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign currency translation losses\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n1,334\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n1,703\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrealized gains on defined benefit plans, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n105\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n92\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrealized gains on cash flow hedges, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n179\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive loss\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n1,175\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n1,432\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n91\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n11.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS \nStock-Based Compensation Plans\n \nStock Plans\nIn fiscal 2021, we adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan to replace the Amended and Restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan) which provides for the issuance of long-term performance awards, including restricted stock-based awards, non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options, as well as stock purchase rights and stock appreciation rights, to our eligible employees, officers and directors who are also employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers. In fiscal 2022 and 2024, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved the adoption of the Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the 2020 Plan and, together with the 2000 Plan, the Plans), which increased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued under the 2020 Plan by \n300\n million shares and \n350\n million shares, respectively. Approximately \n381\n million shares of common stock were available for future awards under the 2020 Plan as of May 31, 2025. Under the 2020 Plan, for each share granted as a full value award in the form of a RSU or a performance-based restricted stock award, an equivalent of \n2.5\n shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant.\nAs of May 31, 2025, \n113\n million unvested restricted stock units (RSUs), \n34\n million PSOs (of which \n12\n million shares were vested) and service-based stock options (SOs) to purchase \n7\n million shares of common stock, substantially all\n \nof which were vested, were outstanding under the Plans. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under either of the Plans.\nThe vesting schedule for all awards granted under the Plans is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee). RSUs generally require s\nervice-based vesting of \n25\n% annually over \nfour years\n. SOs were previously granted under the 2000 Plan at not less than fair market value, become exercisable generally 25% annually over \nfour years\n of service, and generally expire \n10\n years from the date of grant.\nPSOs granted under the 2000 Plan to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer in fiscal 2018 consisted of \nseven\n numerically equivalent vesting tranches that potentially could vest. \nOne\n tranche, which was based solely on the attainment of a market-based metric, was achieved and vested in fiscal 2022. Each of the remaining \nsix\n tranches required the attainment of both a performance metric and a market capitalization metric by May 31, 2022, which was subsequently extended by \nthree\n additional fiscal years to May 31, 2025 via an amendment approved by the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2022. Stock-based compensation expense was recognized starting at the time each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service period. Stock-based compensation associated with a vesting tranche where vesting is no longer determined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the period when such a determination is made.\nThe Compensation Committee certified that all \nsix\n market capitalization goals have been achieved. Additionally:\n•\nOne\n operational performance goal was achieved in fiscal 2023 and \none\n tranche vested in fiscal 2024;\n•\nOne\n operational performance goal was achieved in fiscal 2024 and \none\n tranche vested in fiscal 2025;\n•\nTwo\n operational performance goals were achieved in fiscal 2025, but the Compensation Committee has not yet certified the achievement of these performance goals and accordingly, \ntwo\n tranches were outstanding and not yet vested as of May 31, 2025; and\n•\nTwo\n operational performance goals were not achieved in fiscal 2025. The Compensation Committee has not yet deemed the remaining \ntwo\n tranches as forfeited and these tranches were outstanding as of May 31, 2025.\nThe 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan) provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stock-based awards, including non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of the Directors’ Plan, \n10\n million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by \n2\n million \nshares). Currently, we only grant RSUs that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date\n \n\n\n92\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nof \ngrant. In fiscal \n2016, the Directors’ Plan was amended to permit the Compensation Committee to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants for chairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors’ Plan. In fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic RSU grants to each non-employee director to $\n350,000\n and eliminated all equity grants for chairing Board committees. As of May 31, 2025, approximately \n21,000\n unvested RSUs were outstanding under the Directors’ Plan.

The total aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock-based awards that vested and were issued and stock options that were exercised was $\n9.0\n billion, $\n7.4\n billion and $\n5.1\n billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. In connection with the vesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options that were exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were $\n2.1\n billion, $\n1.7\n billion and $\n1.2\n billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is \n95\n% of the fair market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2025, \n34\n million shares were reserved for future issuances under the Purchase Plan. We issued approximately \n1\n million shares in fiscal 2025 and \n2\n million shares in each of fiscal 2024 and 2023 under the Purchase Plan.\n\n\n94\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nDefined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans\n \nWe offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $\n485\n million, $\n468\n million and $\n470\n million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the U.S., regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generally contribute up to \n40\n% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as defined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently \n50\n% up to \n6\n% of compensation each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $\n206\n million, $\n200\n million and $\n198\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual base and/or variable compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately $\n1.1\n billion and approximately $\n988\n million as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and were presented in other non-current assets and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nWe sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $\n69\n million, $\n71\n million and $\n78\n million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status, which is substantially included in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets) of our defined benefit plans as of May 31, 2025 were $\n1.1\n billion and $\n350\n million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2024 were $\n997\n million and $\n313\n million, respectively.\n12.\nINCOME TAXES\n \nOur effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned and losses incurred in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Our provision for income taxes varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of

provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings and the other outside basis temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At May 31, 2025, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $\n11.0\n billion. If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2025, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $\n2.0\n billion.\nOur net deferred tax assets were $\n10.2\n billion and $\n8.6\n billion as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.\n \nThe valuation allowance was $\n2.0\n billion and $\n1.9\n billion as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, primarily related to U.S., state and foreign tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. Any subsequent reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded to our provision for income taxes unless the conclusion of an acquisition valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated tax benefits is within the measurement period (as defined above).\n\n\n97\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nAt May 31, 2025, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n270\n million, which are subject to limitation on their utilization. Approximately $\n180\n million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal \n2026\n and fiscal \n2038\n. Approximately $\n90\n million of these federal net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n2.1\n billion at May 31, 2025, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $\n2.0\n billion of these state net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal \n2026\n and fiscal \n2045\n. Approximately $\n98\n million of these state net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n1.8\n billion at May 31, 2025, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $\n1.7\n billion of these foreign net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $\n34\n million, expire between fiscal \n2027\n and fiscal \n2044\n. At May 31, 2025, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of approximately $\n134\n million, which expire between fiscal \n2026\n and fiscal \n2027\n. We had state capital loss carryforwards of approximately $\n307\n million, which expire between fiscal \n2026\n an\nd fiscal \n2037\n. We had foreign capital loss carryforwards of approximately $\n164\n million, which are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $\n1.4\n billion at May 31, 2025, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $\n840\n million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately $\n534\n million, expire in various years between fiscal \n2026\n and fiscal \n2045\n.\nCurrent income taxes payable are included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $\n2.3\n billion and $\n2.1\n billion as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or non-current income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. \nThe aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisitions, were as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross unrecognized tax benefits as of June 1\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,785\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,715\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,284\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n239\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n492\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n709\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n98\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n128\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n45\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n846\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n889\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n669\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSettlements with tax authorities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n161\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n46\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n212\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLapses of statutes of limitation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n162\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n129\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n631\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative translation adjustments and other, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n11\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n59\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal gross unrecognized tax benefits as of May 31\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9,438\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,785\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,715\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAs of May 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, $\n4.5\n billion, $\n4.2\n billion and $\n3.9\n billion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations of $\n321\n million, $\n199\n million and $\n111\n million during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2025 and 2024 were $\n2.1\n billion and $\n1.8\n billion, respectively.\nDomestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2022. Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process, the most significant of which include issues related to transfer pricing, domestic production activity, one-time transition tax, foreign tax credits and research and development credits. With respect to all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2025, our gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $\n651\n million ($\n517\n million net of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2013 and, with some exceptions, we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.\nInternationally, \ntax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining or have examined returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2024. Many of the relevant tax years are at an advanced stage in examination or subsequent controversy resolution processes, the most significant of which include issues\n \n\n\n98\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nrelated \nto transfer pricing and withholding tax. The manner in which those issues are resolved and the timing thereof could potentially result in a range of decreases or increases in our unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. With respect to all of these international audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe it was reasonably possible that, as of \nMay 31, 2025, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $\n807\n million ($\n319\n million net of offsetting tax benefits). We also believe it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2025, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could increase in the next 12 months by as much as $\n615\n million ($\n107\n million net of offsetting \nU.S. tax benefits). With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001.\nWe are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Spain, where the amounts under controversy are significant. In some, although not all, cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.\nWe believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof.\n13.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION \nASC 280, \nSegment Reporting\n, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are our \nChief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer\n. We are organized by line of business and geographically. While \nour CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. The tabular information below presents financial information, including information on segment revenues, significant segment expenses categories and amounts on a segment basis and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss, that is regularly provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the company’s performance and allocating company resources\n.\n \nWe have \nthree\n businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of which is comprised of a \nsingle\n operating segment. All \nthree\n of our businesses market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.\nOur cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. Cloud services and license support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers over time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms. Cloud services and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available and for which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual term. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments. We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is\n \n\n\n99\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nmade available to the customer to download and use, which typically is immediate upon signature of the license contract. In each fiscal year, our cloud and license business’ contractual activities, excluding the impact of timing of booking of large contracts, are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are largely personnel- and infrastructure-related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings and marketing program costs.\nOur hardware business provides infrastructure technologies including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also offers hardware support, which provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of their hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services that are typically delivered and recognized ratably over the contractual term. Costs associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products with eligible support contracts; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel-related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.\nOur services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Costs associated with our services business consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.\nWe do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment.\nThe following table presents summary results for each of our three businesses for each of fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud and license:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n49,230\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n44,464\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n41,086\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud services and license support expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,827\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,783\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,222\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales and marketing expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,473\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,167\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,738\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMargin\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n30,930\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n28,514\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n26,126\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,936\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,066\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,274\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware products and support expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n742\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n855\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,011\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales and marketing expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n276\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n296\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n331\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMargin\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,918\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,915\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,932\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,233\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,431\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,594\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nServices expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,240\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,515\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,490\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMargin\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n993\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n916\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,104\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotals:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n57,399\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n52,961\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n49,954\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23,558\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21,616\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20,792\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMargin\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n33,841\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n31,345\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n29,162\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nThe \nmargins reported reflect only the direct controllable costs of each line of business and do not include allocations of research and development, general and administrative and certain other allocable expenses, net.

SHARE\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock-based awards, stock options and shares issuable under the Purchase Plan as applicable pursuant to the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions, except per share data)\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12,443\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10,467\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,503\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,789\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,744\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,696\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDilutive effect of employee stock plans\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n77\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n79\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n70\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDilutive weighted-average common shares outstanding\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,866\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,823\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,766\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic earnings per share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4.46\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.82\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.15\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiluted earnings per share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4.34\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.71\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.07\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-dilutive stock awards excluded from calculation\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nThese stock awards relate to anti-dilutive restricted service-based awards as calculated using the treasury stock method and contingently issuable shares pursuant to PSOs arrangements.

(the Oracle Defendants), Salesforce.com, Inc. and SFDC Netherlands B.V. in the District Court of Amsterdam. TPC alleges that the Oracle Defendants’ Data Management Platform product violates certain articles of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Dutch Telecommunications Act (Telecommunicatiewet). TPC claims damages under a number of categories, including: “immaterial damages” (at a fixed amount of €\n500\n per Dutch internet user); “material damages” (in that the costs of loss of control over personal data should be equated to the market value of the personal data for parties like the Oracle Defendants); compensation for losses suffered due to an alleged data breach (at a fixed amount of €\n100\n per Dutch internet user); and compensation for the costs of the litigation funder (\n10\n% to \n25\n% of the compensation awarded); and the (actual) cost of the proceedings and extrajudicial costs.\n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nWe filed our defense on March 3, 2021, and on December 29, 2021, the District Court issued a judgment, holding that all of TPC’s claims were deemed inadmissible because of fundamental procedural flaws. TPC filed an appeal with the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam challenging the District Court’s judgment, except for the claims regarding the alleged data breach, which were dropped. On June 18, 2024, the Court of Appeal overturned the District Court’s decision regarding admissibility, thus permitting the case to proceed. We requested that the Court of Appeal permit an interim appeal to the Dutch Supreme Court and/or the European Court of Justice. On September 24, 2024, the Court of Appeal issued a judgment confirming that TPC’s claims are admissible and referred the matter back to the District Court of Amsterdam for a decision on the merits of TPC’s claims, including TPC’s claims for damages under article 82 of the GDPR. The Court of Appeal also granted Oracle’s request for an interim appeal to the Supreme Court, appealing the June 18 and September 24, 2024 judgments.\nOracle filed its statement of appeal with the Dutch Supreme Court on December 20, 2024, and TPC appeared in the proceedings on January 31, 2025. The filing of the Supreme Court appeal effectively suspended proceedings before the District Court pursuant to applicable procedural rules. TPC filed its statement of defense in response to our Supreme Court appeal and a counter appeal on February 27, 2025. Oracle filed its statement of defense to the counter appeal on March 28, 2025. TPC and Oracle are to file written submissions setting out their detailed arguments on or before July 18, 2025 and to file their respective written replies and rejoinders on or before August 29, 2025.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, including defenses to the quantum of damages claimed, and we will continue to vigorously defend it.\nWhile the final outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot estimate a range of loss at this time, we do not believe that it will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nOther Litigation\nWe are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any.\n\n\n103\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nIte\nm 16.\tForm 10-K Summary\n \nNone.\n\n\n104\n\n\n\n\nTable of
