Unless expressly stated otherwise, for discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2022 items and of fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022, please refer to Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\n in our combined 2023\n \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\n, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nRefer to the Glossary of Terms included in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for abbreviations and acronyms used throughout this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.  \nThe only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Eversource.  Our earnings discussion includes financial measures that are not recognized under GAAP (non-GAAP) referencing our earnings and EPS excluding losses on the sales and impairments of the offshore wind equity method investments, a loss on the pending sale of the Aquarion water distribution business, a loss on the disposition of land that was initially acquired to construct the Northern Pass Transmission project and was subsequently abandoned, and certain transaction and transition costs.  EPS by business is also a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated by dividing the Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource common shares outstanding for the period. The earnings and EPS of each business do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities of such business, but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. \nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results by business and to more fully compare and explain our results without including these items.  This information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance and planning and forecasting of future periods.  We believe the impacts of the losses on the offshore wind equity method investments, the loss on the pending sale of the Aquarion water distribution business, the loss on the disposition of land associated with an abandoned project, and transaction and transition costs are not indicative of our ongoing costs and performance.  We view these charges as not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business and therefore not an indicator of baseline operating performance.  Due to the nature and significance of the effect of these items on Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders and EPS, we believe that the non-GAAP presentation is a more meaningful representation of our financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers of this report in analyzing historical and future performance of our business.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to reported Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of operating performance.\nFinancial Condition and Business Analysis\nExecutive Summary\nEversource Energy is a public utility holding company primarily engaged, through its wholly-owned regulated utility subsidiaries, in the energy delivery business.  Eversource Energy's wholly-owned regulated utility subsidiaries consist of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH (electric utilities), Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and EGMA (natural gas utilities) and Aquarion (water utilities).  Eversource is organized into the electric distribution, electric transmission, natural gas distribution, and water distribution reportable segments. \nThe following items in this executive summary are explained in more detail in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nEarnings Overview and Future Outlook:\n•\nWe earned $811.7 million, or $2.27 per share, in 2024, compared with a loss of $442.2 million, or $1.26 per share, in 2023.  Our 2024 results include an aggregate, net after-tax loss on the sales of our offshore wind investments of $524.0 million, or $1.47 per share, and an after-tax loss resulting from the expected sale of Aquarion of $298.3 million, or $0.83 per share.  Our 2023 results included after-tax impairment charges on our offshore wind investments of $1.95 billion, or $5.58 per share.  Our 2023 results also included after-tax land abandonment and other charges of $6.9 million, or $0.02 per share.  Excluding these charges, our non-GAAP earnings were $1.63 billion, or $4.57 per share, in 2024, compared with non-GAAP earnings of $1.52 billion, or $4.34 per share, in 2023.\n•\nWe project that we will earn within a 2025 earning guidance range of between $4.67 per share and $4.82 per share.  We also project that our long-term EPS growth rate through 2029 will be in a 5 to 7 percent range, using 2024 non-GAAP EPS of $4.57 per share as the base year. \nLiquidity:\n•\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.16 billion in 2024, compared with $1.65 billion in 2023.  Investments in property, plant and equipment totaled $4.48 billion in 2024, compared with $4.34 billion in 2023.  \n29\n•\nCash totaled $26.7 million as of December 31, 2024, compared with $53.9 million as of December 31, 2023.  Our available borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs totaled $607.2 million as of December 31, 2024.  \n•\nIn 2024, we issued $4.50 billion of new long-term debt and we repaid $1.95 billion of long-term debt.\n•\nIn 2024, we paid dividends totaling $2.86 per common share, compared with dividends of $2.70 per common share in 2023.  Our quarterly common share dividend payment was $0.715 per share in 2024, as compared to $0.675 per share in 2023.  On January 29, 2025, our Board of Trustees approved a common share dividend payment of $0.7525 per share, payable on March 31, 2025 to shareholders of record as of March 4, 2025.\n•\nWe project to make capital expenditures of $24.17 billion from 2025 through 2029, of which we expect $10.22 billion to be in our electric distribution segment, $6.00 billion to be in our natural gas distribution segment, and $6.81 billion to be in our electric transmission segment.  We also project to invest $1.15 billion in information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements.\nStrategic Developments:\n•\nOn January 27, 2025, Eversource entered into a definitive agreement to sell Aquarion.  Subject to certain closing adjustments, the aggregate enterprise value of the sale is approximately $2.4 billion in cash, which includes approximately $1.6 billion for the equity and $800 million of net debt that will be extinguished at closing.  The sale is subject to regulatory and other approvals and is expected to close in late 2025.  Eversource plans to use the net proceeds from the pending sale to pay down parent company debt.\n•\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Eversource completed the sale of its 50 percent ownership share in the Sunrise Wind project to Ørsted for adjusted proceeds of $152 million and completed the sale of its 50 percent ownership share in the South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects to GIP for adjusted gross proceeds of $745 million.  Eversource recognized an aggregate net after-tax loss on the sales of its offshore wind investments of $524 million.  Eversource recorded a contingent liability of $365 million, reflecting its estimate of the future obligations under the GIP sale terms, which include an expected cost overrun sharing obligation, expected obligation to maintain GIP’s internal rate of return, and obligation for other future costs.  Eversource does not have any ongoing financial obligations associated with Sunrise Wind. \nEarnings Overview\nConsolidated:\n  Below is a summary of our earnings/(loss) by business, which also reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of consolidated non-GAAP earnings and EPS, as well as EPS by business, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders and diluted EPS.\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Millions of Dollars, Except Per Share Amounts)\nAmount\nPer Share\nAmount\nPer Share\nAmount\nPer Share\nNet Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders (GAAP)\n$\n811.7 \n$\n2.27 \n$\n(442.2)\n$\n(1.26)\n$\n1,404.9 \n$\n4.05 \nRegulated Companies (Non-GAAP)\n$\n1,691.9 \n$\n4.73 \n$\n1,509.3 \n$\n4.31 \n$\n1,460.4 \n$\n4.21 \nEversource Parent and Other Companies (Non-GAAP)\n(57.9)\n(0.16)\n8.4 \n0.03 \n(40.5)\n(0.12)\nNon-GAAP Earnings\n$\n1,634.0 \n$\n4.57 \n$\n1,517.7 \n$\n4.34 \n$\n1,419.9 \n$\n4.09 \nLosses on Offshore Wind Investments (after-tax) \n(1)\n(524.0)\n(1.47)\n(1,953.0)\n(5.58)\n— \n— \nLoss on Pending Sale of Aquarion (after-tax) \n(2)\n(298.3)\n(0.83)\n— \n— \n— \n— \nLand Abandonment Loss and Other Charges (after-tax) \n(3)\n— \n— \n(6.9)\n(0.02)\n— \n— \nTransaction and Transition Costs (after-tax) \n(4)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n(15.0)\n(0.04)\nNet Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders (GAAP)\n$\n811.7 \n$\n2.27 \n$\n(442.2)\n$\n(1.26)\n$\n1,404.9 \n$\n4.05 \n(1)    \nIn 2024, we recorded a loss on the sales of our offshore wind equity method investments.

Those earnings increases were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs, higher interest expense, higher depreciation expense, the absence of a prior year benefit at PSNH related to the establishment of a new regulatory tracking mechanism that allowed for the recovery of previously incurred operating expenses associated with poles acquired on May 1, 2023, higher property tax expense, and a higher effective tax rate.\n \nOur electric transmission segment earnings increased $81.2 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and the impact of the annual rate reconciliation filing with FERC, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. \nOur natural gas distribution segment earnings increased $66.2 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to higher revenues from base distribution rate increases effective November 1, 2024 at EGMA and effective November 1, 2024 and November 1, 2023 at NSTAR Gas and capital tracking mechanisms due to continued investments in natural gas infrastructure.  Earnings also benefited from lower operations and maintenance expense, the absence of a prior year unfavorable regulatory adjustment resulting from NSTAR Gas’ GSEP reconciliation filing, and a lower effective tax rate.  Those earnings increases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense, and higher property tax expense.\nOur water distribution segment recognized a $297 million impairment charge in 2024 as a result of writing down the carrying value of the business to fair value due to the expected sale of Aquarion.  Excluding the impairment charge and transaction costs associated with the expected sale, water distribution segment earnings increased $11.5 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to an after-tax benefit of $11.6 million recorded in 2024 to recognize the impacts of the Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut’s rate case decision from PURA.  The impacts of PURA’s rate case decision on March 15, 2023 were recorded beginning in March 2024 as a result of the State of Connecticut Superior Court’s decision on the rate case appeal on March 25, 2024.  The impacts primarily include a reduction to depreciation expense to reflect lower depreciation rates ordered by PURA in its final decision, partially offset by lower authorized revenues. \nEversource Parent and Other Companies:\n  Eversource parent and other companies’ losses decreased $1.37 billion in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to the loss on the sale of Eversource parent’s offshore wind investments in 2024, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $524.0 million, as compared to an impairment charge on these investments in 2023 of $1.95 billion.  Results for 2023 also include a loss on the disposition of land that was initially acquired to construct the Northern Pass Transmission project and was subsequently abandoned and other charges recorded of $6.9 million.  Excluding these charges, Eversource parent and other companies earnings decreased by $66.3 million due primarily to higher interest expense and the absence of a benefit in 2023 from the liquidation of Eversource parent’s equity method investment in a renewable energy fund, partially offset by the absence of a charitable contribution made in 2023 with a portion of the proceeds from the liquidation, and a lower effective tax rate.\nLiquidity\nSources and Uses of Cash:\n  Eversource’s regulated business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources.  Eversource’s regulated companies’ capital resources are provided by cash flows generated from operations, short-term borrowings, long-term debt issuances, capital contributions from Eversource parent, and existing cash, and are used to fund their liquidity and capital requirements.  Eversource’s regulated companies typically maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements.  Short-term borrowings are also used as a bridge to long-term debt financings.  The levels of short-term borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations (including timing of storm costs and regulatory recoveries), dividends paid, capital contributions received and the timing of long-term debt financings.\n31\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each uses its available capital resources to fund its respective construction expenditures, meet debt requirements, pay operating costs, including storm-related costs, pay dividends, and fund corporate obligations.  Eversource's regulated companies recover their electric, natural gas and water distribution construction expenditures as the related project costs are depreciated over the life of the assets.  This impacts the timing of the revenue stream designed to fully recover the total investment plus a return on the equity and debt used to finance the investments.  Eversource's regulated companies spend a significant amount of cash on capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on investment and recovery period.  These factors have resulted in current liabilities exceeding current assets by $1.64 billion, $291.7 million and $112.0 million at Eversource, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. \nWe expect the future operating cash flows of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, along with our existing borrowing availability and access to both debt and equity markets, will be sufficient to meet any working capital and future operating requirements, and capital investment forecasted opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $1.40 billion of Eversource's long-term debt, including $600.0 million at Eversource parent, $400.0 million at CL&P and $250.0 million at NSTAR Electric, matures within the next 12 months.  Eversource, with its current credit ratings, has several options available in the financial markets to repay or refinance these maturities with the issuance of new long-term debt.  Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH will reduce their short-term borrowings with operating cash flows or with the issuance of new long-term debt, determined by considering capital requirements and maintenance of Eversource's credit rating and profile.  \nEversource is currently in the process of selling its Aquarion water distribution business.  For information regarding the pending sale and use of proceeds, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Pending Sale of Aquarion\" included in this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\nCash totaled $26.7 million as of December 31, 2024, compared with $53.9 million as of December 31, 2023.\nShort-Term Debt - Commercial Paper Programs and Credit Agreements\n:  Eversource parent has a $2.00 billion commercial paper program allowing Eversource parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt.  Eversource parent, CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas, EGMA and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut are parties to a five-year $2.00 billion revolving credit facility, which terminates on October 11, 2029.  This\n re\nvolving credit facility serves to backstop Eversource parent's $2.00 billion commercial paper program.\nNSTAR Electric has a $650 million commercial paper program allowing NSTAR Electric to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt.  NSTAR Electric is also a party to a five-year $650 million revolving credit facility, which terminates on October 11, 2029, that serves to backstop NSTAR Electric's $650 million commercial paper program.\nThe amount of borrowings outstanding and available under the commercial paper programs were as follows:\nBorrowings Outstanding\n as of December 31,\nAvailable Borrowing Capacity as of December 31,\nWeighted-Average Interest Rate as of December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nEversource Parent Commercial Paper Program \n$\n1,538.0 \n$\n1,771.9 \n$\n462.0 \n$\n228.1 \n4.76 \n%\n5.60 \n%\nNSTAR Electric Commercial Paper Program \n504.8 \n365.8 \n145.2 \n284.2 \n4.55 \n%\n5.40 \n%\nThere were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nCL&P and PSNH have uncommitted line of credit agreements totaling $375 million and $250 million, respectively, all of which will expire in either May 2025, September 2025 or October 2025.

As a result of the CL&P long-term debt issuance in January 2024, $207.3 million of commercial paper borrowings under the Eversource parent commercial paper program were reclassified to Long-Term Debt on Eversource parent’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.  \nIntercompany Borrowings:\n  Eversource parent uses its available capital resources to provide loans to its subsidiaries to assist in meeting their short-term borrowing needs.  Eversource parent records intercompany interest income from its loans to subsidiaries, which is eliminated in consolidation.  Intercompany loans from Eversource parent to its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation on Eversource's balance sheets.  As of December 31, 2024, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to CL&P of $280.0 million and to PSNH of $131.1 million.  As of December 31, 2023, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to CL&P of $457.0 million and to PSNH of $233.0 million.  Eversource parent charges interest on these intercompany loans at the same weighted-average interest rate as its commercial paper program.  Intercompany loans from Eversource parent are included in Notes Payable to Eversource Parent and classified in current liabilities on the respective subsidiary's balance sheets, as these intercompany borrowings are outstanding for no more than 364 days at one time.  As a result of the CL&P long-term debt issuance in January 2024, $207.3 million of CL&P’s intercompany borrowings were reclassified to Long-Term Debt on CL&P’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. \n32\nAvailability under Long-Term Debt Issuance Authorizations:  \nOn May 1, 2024, the DPU approved NSTAR Electric’s request for authorization to issue up to $2.40 billion in long-term debt through December 31, 2026.

PSNH paid $43.2 million of RRB principal payments in each of 2024 and 2023, and paid $14.9 million and $16.2 million of interest payments in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCommon Share Issuances:  \nEversource had an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which it could offer and sell up to $1.2 billion of its common shares from time to time through an “at-the-market” (ATM) equity offering program.  In 2024, Eversource issued 15,740,294 common shares, which resulted in proceeds of $989.4 million, net of issuance costs.  Eversource used the net proceeds received for general corporate purposes.  In 2023, \nno\n shares were issued under this agreement.  Eversource completed the program in October 2024. \n33\nCash Flows:\n  Cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity, and the distribution of natural gas and water.  Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.16 billion in 2024, compared with $1.65 billion in 2023.  Operating cash flows were favorably impacted by the timing of cash payments made on our accounts payable, a $108.8 million increase due to income tax refunds received in 2024 as compared to income tax payments made in 2023, an improvement in regulatory under-recoveries driven primarily by the timing of collections for the CL&P non-bypassable FMCC and other regulatory tracking mechanisms partially offset by the unfavorable impact in the timing of collections for energy supply costs, a $20.7 million decrease in cost of removal expenditures, a $12.4 million decrease in cash payments to vendors for storm costs, and the timing of other working capital items.  The impacts of regulatory collections are included in both Regulatory Recoveries and Amortization on the statements of cash flows.  These favorable impacts were partially offset by the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable.\nIn 2024, we paid cash dividends of $1.00 billion and issued non-cash dividends of $23.5 million\n \nin the form of treasury shares, totaling dividends of $1.03 billion, or $2.86 per common share.  In 2023, we paid cash dividends of $919.0 million and issued non-cash dividends of $23.4 million in the form of treasury shares, totaling dividends of $942.4 million, or $2.70 per common share.  Our quarterly common share dividend payment was $0.715 per share in 2024, as compared to $0.675 per share in 2023.  On January 29, 2025, our Board of Trustees approved a common share dividend payment of $0.7525 per share, payable on March 31, 2025 to shareholders of record as of March 4, 2025.\nEversource issues treasury shares to satisfy awards under the Company's incentive plans, shares issued under the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan, and matching contributions under the Eversource 401k Plan.\nIn 2024, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH paid $333.8 million, $643.9 million and $62.0 million, respectively, in common stock dividends to Eversource parent. \nInvestments in Property, Plant and Equipment on the statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized and deferred portions of pension and PBOP income/expense.  In 2024, investments for Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, and PSNH were $4.48 billion, $978.5 million, $1.56 billion and $608.8 million, respectively.  Capital expenditures were primarily for continuing projects to maintain and improve infrastructure and operations, including enhancing reliability to the transmission and distribution systems.\n \nContractual Obligations:  \nFor information regarding our cash requirements from contractual obligations and payment schedules, see Note 9, \"Long-Term Debt,\" Note 10, \"Rate Reduction Bonds and Variable Interest Entities,\" Note 11A, \"Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension,\" Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" and Note 14, \"Leases,\" to the financial statements.  \nEstimated interest payments on existing long-term fixed-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the coupon rate on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement as of December 31, 2024 and are as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\nEversource\n$\n1,113.5 \n$\n1,044.2 \n$\n982.4 \n$\n872.3 \n$\n764.4 \n$\n6,793.6 \n$\n11,570.4 \nOur commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual obligations include other liabilities reflected on our balance sheets, and guarantees of certain obligations primarily associated with construction of our previously owned offshore wind investments.\nFor information regarding our projected capital expenditures over the next five years, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Projected Capital Expenditures\" included in this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\nCredit Ratings:\n  A summary of our current corporate credit ratings and outlooks by S&P, Moody's, and Fitch is as follows:\n \nS&P\nMoody's\nFitch\n \nCurrent\nOutlook\nCurrent\nOutlook\nCurrent\nOutlook\nEversource Parent\nBBB+\nStable\nBaa2\nNegative\nBBB\nStable\nCL&P\nA-\nStable\nA3\nNegative\nA- \nStable\nNSTAR Electric\nA-\nStable\nA2\nNegative\nA-\nStable\nPSNH\nA-\nStable\nA3\nStable\nA-\nStable\nA summary of the current credit ratings and outlooks by S&P, Moody's, and Fitch for senior unsecured debt of Eversource parent and NSTAR Electric, and senior secured debt of CL&P and PSNH is as follows:\n \nS&P\nMoody's\nFitch\n \nCurrent\nOutlook\nCurrent\nOutlook\nCurrent\nOutlook\nEversource Parent\nBBB\nStable\nBaa2\nNegative\nBBB\nStable\nCL&P\nA\nStable\nA1\nNegative\nA+\nStable\nNSTAR Electric\nA-\nStable\nA2\nNegative\nA\nStable\nPSNH\nA\nStable\nA1\nStable\nA+ \nStable\n34\nIn June 2024, Moody’s revised the outlook from stable to negative for CL&P citing a weaker financial profile and a challenging Connecticut regulatory environment.  In December 2024, S&P downgraded the ratings for Eversource parent and its subsidiaries primarily due to S&P's negative assessment of the Connecticut regulatory construct for Eversource’s Connecticut utilities.  These credit ratings and outlook changes reflect higher regulatory risk in Connecticut with the regulatory construct and adverse regulatory developments, including recent rate orders and the passage of Senate Bill 7, negatively impacting the credit quality of Eversource and its subsidiaries.  \nBusiness Development and Capital Expenditures\nOur consolidated capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized and deferred portions of pension and PBOP income/expense (all of which are non-cash factors), totaled $4.64 billion in 2024, $4.59 billion in 2023, and $3.79 billion in 2022.  These amounts included $260.5 million in 2024, $214.4 million in 2023, and $266.5 million in 2022 related to information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements, primarily at Eversource Service and The Rocky River Realty Company.\nElectric Transmission Business:  \nOur consolidated electric transmission business capital expenditures decreased by $120.0 million in 2024, as compared to 2023.  A summary of electric transmission capital expenditures by company is as follows:  \n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCL&P\n$\n450.0 \n$\n470.4 \n$\n416.8 \nNSTAR Electric\n502.0 \n567.4 \n438.4 \nPSNH\n375.8 \n410.0 \n351.8 \nTotal Electric Transmission\n$\n1,327.8 \n$\n1,447.8 \n$\n1,207.0 \nOur transmission projects are designed to improve the reliability of the electric grid, meet customer demand for power, and strengthen the electric grid's resilience against extreme weather and other safety and security threats.  In Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, our transmission projects include transmission line upgrades, the installation of new transmission interconnection facilities, substations and lines, and transmission substation enhancements.\nGreater Cambridge Energy Program:\n  The Greater Cambridge Energy Program will construct Eversource’s first underground transmission substation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, along with associated transmission and distribution lines.  The project will address the increased electric demand in the region, enhance the resiliency of the transmission system, and ensure a flexible grid to reliably serve customers.  The flexibility to transmit and distribute mixed energy sources will support the decarbonization and electrification goals of both the City of Cambridge and the state of Massachusetts.  The new 115/13.8-kV, 35,000 square foot substation will be located in an underground vault and includes three distribution power transformers supplying thirty-six distribution circuits.  The project also includes five underground duct banks housing eight new 115-kV transmission lines.  The Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board approved the project on June 28, 2024.  Additional required environmental permits are expected to be approved by the end of 2025, as well as a license from the MA DEP expected to be approved by the end of the second quarter of 2026.  The initial in-service date for the project is June 2029, which includes two 115-kV transmission lines and the transmission portion of the substation.  The first distribution circuits and substation distribution will be placed in-service by the end of 2029.  The remaining transmission and distribution circuits will be placed in-service throughout 2030 and into 2031.  The total project cost is approximately $1.84 billion, with $1.38 billion allocated for transmission and $460 million for distribution.  As of December 31, 2024, $100.1 million has been spent on the project, with $70 million for transmission and $30.1 million for distribution.\nDistribution Business:\n  A summary of distribution capital expenditures is as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n CL&P\n NSTAR Electric\n PSNH\n Total Electric\n Natural Gas\nWater\n Total \n2024\nBasic Business\n$\n298.8 \n$\n471.7 \n$\n136.2 \n$\n906.7 \n$\n226.9 \n$\n21.8 \n$\n1,155.4 \nAging Infrastructure\n161.3 \n365.8 \n65.4 \n592.5 \n743.6 \n140.5 \n1,476.6 \nLoad Growth and Other\n110.6 \n194.3 \n66.4 \n371.3 \n52.3 \n0.8 \n424.4 \nTotal Distribution\n$\n570.7 \n$\n1,031.8 \n$\n268.0 \n$\n1,870.5 \n$\n1,022.8 \n$\n163.1 \n$\n3,056.4 \n2023\nBasic Business\n$\n280.3 \n$\n376.6 \n$\n91.1 \n$\n748.0 \n$\n208.2 \n$\n18.5 \n$\n974.7 \nAging Infrastructure\n260.7 \n310.0 \n86.4 \n657.1 \n719.5 \n142.3 \n1,518.9 \nLoad Growth and Other\n138.0 \n191.3 \n37.2 \n366.5 \n70.1 \n0.9 \n437.5 \nTotal Distribution\n$\n679.0 \n$\n877.9 \n$\n214.7 \n$\n1,771.6 \n$\n997.8 \n$\n161.7 \n$\n2,931.1 \n2022\nBasic Business\n$\n267.8 \n$\n202.4 \n$\n68.6 \n$\n538.8 \n$\n175.2 \n$\n16.8 \n$\n730.8 \nAging Infrastructure\n199.9 \n245.1 \n70.8 \n515.8 \n562.3 \n137.6 \n1,215.7 \nLoad Growth and Other\n90.7 \n177.0 \n31.3 \n299.0 \n66.4 \n0.9 \n366.3 \nTotal Distribution\n$\n558.4 \n$\n624.5 \n$\n170.7 \n$\n1,353.6 \n$\n803.9 \n$\n155.3 \n$\n2,312.8 \n35\nFor the electric distribution business, basic business includes the purchase of meters, tools, vehicles, information technology, transformer replacements, equipment facilities, and the relocation of plant.  Aging infrastructure relates to reliability and the replacement of overhead lines, plant substations, underground cable replacement, and equipment failures.  Load growth and other includes requests for new business and capacity additions on distribution lines and substation additions and expansions.\nFor the natural gas distribution business, basic business addresses daily operational needs including meters, pipe relocations due to public works projects, vehicles, and tools.  Aging infrastructure projects seek to improve the reliability of the system through enhancements related to cast iron and bare steel replacement of main and services, corrosion mediation, and station upgrades.  Load growth and other reflects growth in existing service territories including new developments, installation of services, and expansion.\nFor the water distribution business, basic business addresses daily operational needs including periodic meter replacement, water main relocation, facility maintenance, and tools.  Aging infrastructure relates to reliability and the replacement of water mains, regulators, storage tanks, pumping stations, wellfields, reservoirs, and treatment facilities.  Load growth and other reflects growth in our service territory, including improvements of acquisitions, installation of new services, and interconnections of systems.\nPending Sale of Aquarion:\n  In early 2024, Eversource initiated an exploratory assessment of the potential sale of the Aquarion water distribution business.  In December 2024, final bids were received, and Eversource obtained approval from its Board of Trustees to sell the Aquarion water distribution business.  On January 27, 2025, Eversource entered into a definitive agreement to sell Aquarion.  Subject to certain closing adjustments, the aggregate enterprise value of the sale is approximately $2.4 billion in cash, which includes approximately $1.6 billion for the equity and $800 million of net debt that will be extinguished at closing.  The sale is subject to approval by PURA, DPU and the NHPUC, as well as other approvals pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act as well as other customary closing conditions.  The sale is expected to close in late 2025.  Eversource plans to use the net proceeds from the pending sale to pay down parent company debt.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, upon classifying the assets and liabilities as held for sale, Eversource concluded that the likely sale of Aquarion at a loss resulted in the requirement to test water distribution goodwill for impairment.  Eversource performed an impairment test by comparing the fair value of the business to its carrying value and recorded a goodwill impairment of $297 million, as the estimated fair value of the business based on the anticipated sale was less than the carrying value.  The fair value included future cash outflows of approximately $140 million of estimated income taxes as a result of the transaction.  The goodwill impairment charge is presented separately within Operating Income on the Eversource statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nProjected Capital Expenditures:\n \n \nA summary of the projected capital expenditures for the regulated companies' electric transmission and for the total electric distribution and natural gas distribution for 2025 through 2029, including information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements on behalf of the regulated companies, is as follows:\n \nYears\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2025 - 2029 Total\nCL&P Transmission\n$\n441 \n$\n497 \n$\n341 \n$\n269 \n$\n260 \n$\n1,808 \nNSTAR Electric Transmission\n611 \n635 \n675 \n861 \n854 \n3,636 \nPSNH Transmission\n354 \n260 \n347 \n204 \n198 \n1,363 \n  \nTotal Electric Transmission\n1,406 \n1,392 \n1,363 \n1,334 \n1,312 \n6,807 \nElectric Distribution\n1,965 \n2,231 \n2,143 \n1,958 \n1,918 \n10,215 \nNatural Gas Distribution\n1,094 \n1,164 \n1,184 \n1,259 \n1,297 \n5,998 \n  \nTotal Electric and Natural Gas Distribution\n3,059 \n3,395 \n3,327 \n3,217 \n3,215 \n16,213 \nInformation Technology and All Other\n256 \n222 \n222 \n225 \n227 \n1,152 \nTotal\n$\n4,721 \n$\n5,009 \n$\n4,912 \n$\n4,776 \n$\n4,754 \n$\n24,172 \nActual capital expenditures could vary from the projected amounts for the companies and years above.\nThe projected capital expenditures reflect a reduction in planned capital expenditures for Connecticut’s electric and natural gas distribution businesses due to regulatory policies in Connecticut that discourage investment, including ensuring the timely recovery of costs and the ability to earn a fair return. The continuing pattern of adverse regulatory outcomes for Connecticut utilities and associated credit downgrades from our credit rating agencies necessitated a reduction to Connecticut’s electric and natural gas distribution projected capital expenditures.  These capital reductions do not impact Eversource’s commitment to safety, reliability, or critical staffing structure. \nProjected capital expenditures for the water distribution business of $130 million are expected until the time of sale in late 2025 and have been factored into the water business impairment recorded as of December 31, 2024.\nOffshore Wind Business:\n  Eversource’s previous offshore wind business included 50 percent ownership interests in each of North East Offshore and South Fork Class B Member, LLC.  During 2024, Eversource sold its interest in these entities, and in doing so, sold its interests in the Revolution Wind project, the South Fork Wind project, and the Sunrise Wind project.  Eversource’s current offshore wind business is now comprised only of a noncontrolling tax equity investment in South Fork Wind through a 100 percent ownership in South Fork Wind Holdings, LLC Class A interests.   \n36\nOn May 25, 2023, Eversource announced that it had completed a strategic review of its offshore wind investments and determined that it would pursue the sale of its offshore wind investments.  On September 7, 2023, Eversource completed the sale of its 50 percent interest in an uncommitted lease area consisting of approximately 175,000 developable acres located 25 miles off the south coast of Massachusetts to Ørsted for $625 million in an all-cash transaction.  \nIn September of 2023, Eversource made a $528 million investment in a tax equity interest for South Fork Wind.  South Fork Wind was restructured as a tax equity investment, with Eversource purchasing 100 percent ownership of a new Class A tax equity membership interest.  This investment will result in Eversource receiving cash flow benefits from investment tax credits (ITC) and other future cash flow benefits as well.  As of December 31, 2024, $459 million of expected investment tax credits and other expected tax benefits were reclassified from the South Fork Wind tax equity investment balance reported in Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates as a decrease in Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes on the Eversource balance sheet, which represented a non-cash reclassification.  As a result of these investment tax credits, Eversource expects lower federal income tax payments from 2025 to 2027.  As of December 31, 2024, the tax equity interest in South Fork Wind totaled $22.2 million. \nOn January 24, 2024, Eversource entered into an agreement with Ørsted to sell Eversource’s 50 percent share of Sunrise Wind, subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals.  On April 18, 2024, Eversource and Ørsted executed an equity and asset purchase agreement and on July 9, 2024, Eversource completed the sale of its 50 percent ownership share of Sunrise Wind to Ørsted.  In accordance with the equity and asset purchase agreement and after adjustment for a reduction in capital spending compared to forecasted amounts, adjusted proceeds totaled $152 million.  Ørsted paid Eversource $118 million at the closing of the sale transaction, which was used to repay parent company debt.  Remaining proceeds of $34 million will be paid after onshore construction is completed and certain other construction milestones are achieved.  The remaining expected proceeds have been recorded in Other Long-Term Assets on Eversource’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.  Eversource recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of Sunrise Wind of $377 million in 2024.  With completion of the sale, Eversource does not have any ongoing financial obligations associated with Sunrise Wind. \nOn February 13, 2024, Eversource executed an agreement to sell its 50 percent interests in the South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for an initial gross purchase price of approximately $1.1 billion.  The initial purchase price was subject to adjustment based on, among other things, the progress, timing and the construction cost of Revolution Wind, including changes in actual versus forecasted capital spending between signing the agreement and closing of the transaction.  On September 30, 2024, Eversource completed the sale of its 50 percent ownership share in the South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects to GIP for adjusted gross proceeds of $745 million, which were received at closing.  Adjusted gross proceeds from the sale were approximately $375 million lower than the previously estimated purchase price.  This reduction reflects approximately $150 million resulting from lower capital spending between signing the agreement and closing, and approximately $225 million related to the final terms of the sale transaction, primarily due to the delay of the commercial operations date of Revolution Wind.  Proceeds from the transaction were used to repay parent company debt.\nAs part of the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind sale, Eversource and GIP agreed to make certain post-closing purchase price adjustment payments, which could further impact the final purchase price.  The post-closing purchase price adjustment payments include cost sharing obligations that require Eversource to share equally with GIP in GIP’s funding obligations up to an effective cap of approximately $240 million of incremental capital expenditure overruns incurred during the construction phase for Revolution Wind, after which Eversource will have responsibility for GIP’s obligations for any additional capital expenditure overruns in excess of this amount.  The purchase price is also subject to post-closing adjustments as a result of final project economics, which includes Eversource’s obligation to maintain GIP’s internal rate of return through the construction period for each project as specified in the agreement.  Post-closing purchase price adjustment payments will be made following the commercial operation date of Revolution Wind.  South Fork Wind has achieved commercial operation, and Eversource is in the process of finalizing the construction cost post-close purchase price adjustment payment related to this project, which is not expected to be material. \nUpon the completion of both sale transactions in 2024, the total proceeds were compared to the carrying value of the investments, including an estimate of liability for post-closing adjustment payments to GIP, and Eversource recognized an aggregate, net after-tax loss on the sales of its offshore wind investments of $524 million.  The aggregate, net after-tax loss is comprised of (1) the lower proceeds related to final terms of the sale transaction to GIP of approximately $225 million related to non-construction costs for the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects, primarily due to a purchase price reduction of $150 million resulting from the delay of the commercial operations date of Revolution Wind, (2) recently identified forecasted construction costs as a result of a delay in the anticipated commercial operation date related to Revolution Wind of approximately $350 million, which includes an estimate for the anticipated post-closing adjustment to GIP related to Eversource’s expected cost overrun sharing obligation, and (3) approximately $326 million, which includes an estimate for the anticipated post-closing adjustment related to Eversource’s expected obligations to GIP as a result of final economics of the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects and other future costs, as well as a net $60 million increase in income tax expense including an increase in the valuation allowance for unused capital losses.  These losses were partially offset by the $377 million gain on the sale of Sunrise Wind. \nUpon sale, Eversource recorded a contingent liability of $365 million, reflecting its estimate of the future obligations under the GIP sale terms, which include the expected cost overrun sharing obligation, expected obligation to maintain GIP’s internal rate of return, and obligation for other future costs.  The majority of this liability is expected to be settled upon the completion of the Revolution Wind project.  The long-term portion of the liability of $350 million is recorded in Other Long-Term Liabilities, and $15 million is recorded in Other Current Liabilities on Eversource’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. \n37\nContingencies are evaluated using the best information available at the time the financial statements are prepared, and this assessment involves judgments and assumptions about future events.  Factors that could increase the post-closing adjustment payments owed to GIP include the ultimate cost of construction and extent of cost overruns for Revolution Wind, delays in construction, which would impact the economics associated with the purchase price adjustment, and Revolution Wind’s eligibility for federal investment tax credits at a lower value than assumed and included in the purchase price.  \nThe purchase price included the sales value related to a 40 percent level of federal investment tax credits, 10 percent of which is the energy community investment tax credit (ITC) adder included in the Inflation Reduction Act of approximately $170 million related to Revolution Wind.  Although management believes the ITC adder value is realizable, there is some uncertainty at this time as to whether those ITC adders can be achieved, and management continues to evaluate the project’s qualifications and to monitor guidance issued by the United States Treasury Department.  A change in the expected value or qualification of ITC adders could result in a significant loss in a future period.\nNew information or future developments that arise as construction progresses and as cost estimates are reviewed and revised will require a reassessment of the estimated liability for the post-closing adjustment payments.  The Company is currently aware that construction of the offshore foundations, offshore substation and turbine tower installations could result in increased cost overruns in the future.  Only preliminary construction cost projections are available for these cost overruns, and there is insufficient updated information at this point in order for Eversource to change its estimate with reasonably estimable information.  Eversource will continue to assess the potential exposure and adjust the liability as needed.  It is expected that updated costs estimates will become available in the first half of 2025, and adverse changes in facts and circumstances could result in additional losses that could be material.  The Company believes it is reasonably possible that there is an additional loss in excess of the liability recorded, but management cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss beyond the $365 million recorded at this time.  \nTotal net proceeds could also be adjusted for a benefit due to Eversource if there are lower operation costs or higher availability of the projects through the period that is four years following the commercial operation of Revolution Wind.   \nUnder the agreement with GIP, Eversource’s existing and certain additional credit support obligations for Revolution Wind are expected to roll off as the project completes construction.  Under the agreement with Ørsted, Eversource’s existing credit support obligations for Sunrise Wind were either terminated or indemnified by Ørsted as a result of the sale.  Eversource has entered into separate construction management agreements to manage Sunrise Wind’s and Revolution Wind’s onshore electric substation construction through completion. In this role, Eversource will be solely a service provider to Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind.\n2023 Impairments:\n  Equity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist as of the balance sheet date that indicate that the fair value of the investment may be less than book value.  Eversource continually monitors and evaluates its equity method investments to determine if there are indicators of an other-than-temporary impairment.  If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.  Impairment evaluations are based on best information available at the impairment assessment date.  Subsequent declines or recoveries after the reporting date are not considered in the impairment recognized.  Investments that are other-than-temporarily impaired and written down to their estimated fair value cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value.  Impairment evaluations involve a significant degree of judgment and estimation, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist at the equity method investment level, selecting discount rates used to determine fair values, and developing an estimate of discounted future cash flows expected from investment operations or the sale of the investment.  \nDuring 2023, in connection with the process to divest its offshore wind business, Eversource identified indicators for impairment in both the second and fourth quarters of 2023.  In each impairment assessment, Eversource evaluated its investments and determined that the carrying value of the equity method offshore wind investments exceeded the fair value of the investments and that the decline in fair value was other-than-temporary.  The completion of the strategic review in the second quarter of 2023 resulted in Eversource recording a pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charge of $401 million ($331 million after-tax) to reflect the investment at estimated fair value based on the expected sales price at that time. This established a new cost basis in the investments.  Negative developments in the fourth quarter of 2023, including a lower expected sales price, additional projected construction cost increases, and the October 2023 OREC pricing denial for Sunrise Wind, resulted in Eversource conducting an impairment evaluation and recognizing an additional pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charge of $1.77 billion ($1.62 billion after-tax) and establishing a new cost basis in the investments as of December 31, 2023.  The Eversource statement of income for the year ended 2023 reflects a total pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charge of $2.17 billion ($1.95 billion after-tax) in its offshore wind investments.  The impairment charges were non-cash charges and did not impact Eversource’s cash position at the time of the impairment.  Eversource’s offshore wind investments did not meet the criteria to qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. \nThe 2023 impairment evaluations involved judgments in developing the estimates and timing of the future cash flows arising from the expected sales price of Eversource’s 50 percent interest in the wind projects, including expected sales value from investment tax credit adder amounts, less estimated costs to sell, and uncertainties related to the Sunrise Wind re-bid process in New York’s offshore wind solicitation in 2024.  Additional assumptions in the fourth quarter 2023 assessment included revised projected construction costs and estimated project cost overruns, management’s assumption that the Sunrise Wind project would ultimately be abandoned, estimated termination costs, salvage values of Sunrise Wind assets, and the value of the tax equity ownership interest. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses were subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity.  All significant inputs into the impairment evaluations were Level 3 fair value measurements. \n38\nA summary of the significant estimates and assumptions included in the 2023 impairment charges is as follows:\nSecond Quarter 2023\nFourth Quarter 2023\nTotal\n(Millions of Dollars)\nLower expected sales proceeds across all three wind projects\n$\n401 \n$\n525 \n$\n926 \nExpected cost overruns not recovered in the sales price \n— \n441 \n441 \nLoss of sales value from the sale price offered by GIP, including loss of ITC adders value, cancellation costs and other impacts assuming Sunrise Wind project is abandoned\n— \n800 \n800 \nImpairment Charges, pre-tax\n401 \n1,766 \n2,167 \nTax Benefit\n(70)\n(144)\n(214)\nImpairment Charges, after-tax\n$\n331 \n$\n1,622 \n1,953 \nA summary of the carrying value by investee and by project as of December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nInvestments Expected to be Disposed of\nInvestment to be Held\nNorth East Offshore\nSouth Fork Class B Member, LLC\nSouth Fork Wind Holdings, LLC Class A\nTotal Offshore Wind Investments\n(Millions of Dollars)\nSunrise Wind\nRevolution Wind\nCarrying Value as of December 31, 2023, before \n  Impairment Charge\n$\n699 \n$\n799 \n$\n299 \n$\n485 \n$\n2,282 \nFourth Quarter 2023 Impairment Charge\n(1,218)\n(544)\n— \n(4)\n(1,766)\nCarrying Value as of December 31, 2023\n$\n(519)\n$\n255 \n$\n299 \n$\n481 \n$\n516 \nDuring 2024, Eversource sold its interest in the North East Offshore and South Fork Class B, Member LLC equity method investments and recognized an aggregate, net after-tax loss on the sale of its offshore wind investments of $524 million.  \nCapital contributions in the offshore wind investments, including the 2023 contribution for the tax equity investment in South Fork Wind, were included in Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates on the statements of cash flows.  Proceeds received from the sale of the investments in 2024, and proceeds received from the 2023 sale of the unused lease area and from an October 2023 distribution of $318 million received primarily as a result of being a 50 percent joint owner in the Class B shares of South Fork Wind which was restructured as a tax equity investment, were included in Proceeds from Unconsolidated Affiliates on the statements of cash flows.  \nFERC Regulatory Matters\nFERC ROE Complaints:\n  Four separate complaints were filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively, the Complainants).  In each of the first three complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of 11.14 percent that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate 15-month complaint periods.  In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE billed of 10.57 percent and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive (incentive cap) of 11.74 percent, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable. \nThe ROE originally billed during the period October 1, 2011 (beginning of the first complaint period) through October 15, 2014 consisted of a base ROE of 11.14 percent and incentives up to 13.1 percent.  On October 16, 2014, FERC issued Opinion No. 531-A and set the base ROE at 10.57 percent and the incentive cap at 11.74 percent for the first complaint period.  This was also effective for all prospective billings to customers beginning October 16, 2014.  This FERC order was vacated on April 14, 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the Court).  \nAll amounts associated with the first complaint period have been refunded.  Eversource has recorded a reserve of $39.1 million (pre-tax and excluding interest) for the second complaint period as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.  This reserve represents the difference between the billed rates during the second complaint period and a 10.57 percent base ROE and 11.74 percent incentive cap.  The reserve consisted of $21.4 million for CL&P, $14.6 million for NSTAR Electric and $3.1 million for PSNH as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nOn October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court.  FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE.  Initial briefs were filed by the NETOs, Complainants and FERC Trial Staff on January 11, 2019 and reply briefs were filed on March 8, 2019.  The NETOs' brief was supportive of the overall ROE methodology determined in the October 16, 2018 order provided the FERC does not change the proposed methodology or alter its implementation in a manner that has a material impact on the results. \nThe FERC order included illustrative calculations for the first complaint using FERC's proposed frameworks with financial data from that complaint.  Those illustrative calculations indicated that for the first complaint period, for the NETOs, which FERC concludes are of average financial risk, the preliminary just and reasonable base ROE is 10.41 percent and the preliminary incentive cap on total ROE is 13.08 percent.  If the results of the illustrative calculations were included in a final FERC order for each of the complaint periods, then a 10.41 percent base ROE and a 13.08 percent incentive cap would not have a significant impact on our financial statements for all of the complaint periods.  These preliminary calculations are not binding and do not represent what we believe to be the most likely outcome of a final FERC order.\n39\nOn November 21, 2019, FERC issued Opinion No. 569 affecting the two pending transmission ROE complaints against the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) transmission owners, in which FERC adopted a new methodology for determining base ROEs.  Various parties sought rehearing.  On December 23, 2019, the NETOs filed supplementary materials in the NETOs' four pending cases to respond to this new methodology because of the uncertainty of the applicability to the NETOs' cases.  On May 21, 2020, the FERC issued its order in Opinion No. 569-A on the rehearing of the MISO transmission owners' cases, in which FERC again changed its methodology for determining the MISO transmission owners' base ROEs.  On November 19, 2020, the FERC issued Opinion No. 569-B denying rehearing of Opinion No. 569-A and reaffirmed the methodology previously adopted in Opinion No. 569-A.  The new methodology differs significantly from the methodology proposed by FERC in its October 16, 2018 order to determine the NETOs' base ROEs in their four pending cases.  FERC Opinion Nos. 569-A and 569-B were appealed to the Court.  On August 9, 2022, the Court issued its decision vacating MISO ROE FERC Opinion Nos. 569, 569-A and 569-B and remanded to FERC to reopen the proceedings.  The Court found that FERC’s development of the new return methodology was arbitrary and capricious due to FERC’s failure to offer a reasonable explanation for its decision to reintroduce the risk-premium financial model in its new methodology for calculating a just and reasonable return. \nOn October 17, 2024, FERC issued an order on the remand of the MISO ROE proceedings. The order addressed the Court’s decision that the reintroduction of the risk-premium financial model in the ROE methodology was arbitrary and capricious by removing the risk-premium financial model from the ROE methodology.  The removal of the risk-premium financial model was the only revision to FERC’s ROE methodology and resulted in a two-model approach utilizing the two-step discounted cash flow model and the capital asset pricing model.  MISO was directed to provide refunds for the period November 12, 2013 to February 11, 2015 (the first MISO ROE complaint refund period) and for the period from September 28, 2016 (the date of FERC’s order on the first MISO ROE complaint) to October 17, 2024 by December 1, 2025.  The order also stated that FERC does not preclude the use of the risk-premium financial model in future proceedings if the parties can demonstrate that FERC’s stated concerns around the inclusion of the model have been addressed.\nOn November 13, 2024, the NETOs filed a supplemental brief in their four pending ROE proceedings to explain to FERC that it cannot apply the reasoning and methodologies of the MISO ROE case to the NETOs’ cases due to the entirely different set of facts in the MISO and NETOs ROE proceedings.  Doing so would violate the substance of the Court’s April 14, 2017 order and would violate the legal standard required by the Federal Power Act.\nOn February 4, 2025, the MISO transmission owners submitted a petition for review with the Court requesting review of the October 17, 2024 MISO ROE order on remand and a December 19, 2024 notice of denial of rehearing.  The petition requests review of FERC’s decision to retroactively backdate the MISO transmission owners’ base ROE to the date of an earlier order that FERC abandoned when it issued Order No. 569, treat an underlying unlawful complaint as if it were legitimate, and order eight years of interest as part of the directed refunds.\nGiven the significant uncertainty regarding the applicability of the FERC order in the MISO transmission owners’ two complaint cases to the NETOs’ pending four complaint cases due to the complex differences between the cases, Eversource concluded that there is no reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaints or subsequent periods at this time and Eversource cannot reasonably estimate any potential range of loss for any of the four complaint proceedings at this time.  The resolution of these proceedings could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH currently record revenues at the 10.57 percent base ROE and incentive cap at 11.74 percent established in the October 16, 2014 FERC order. \nA change of 10 basis points to the base ROE used to establish the reserves would impact Eversource’s after-tax earnings by an average of approximately $3 million for each of the four 15-month complaint periods.  Prospectively from the date of a final FERC order implementing a new base ROE, based off of estimated 2024 rate base, a change of 10 basis points to the base ROE would impact Eversource’s future annual after-tax earnings by approximately $6 million per year, and will increase slightly over time as we continue to invest in our transmission infrastructure.\nTransmission Rates and Other Transmission Rates-Related Proceedings:  \nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH transmission rates are calculated in accordance with a FERC-approved formula ratemaking framework and each utility is required to file an annual update on or before July 31st with resulting rates effective January 1st the following year.  The formula rate framework provides for an annual reconciliation of the prior calendar year actual costs incurred related to our transmission facilities, including an allowed ROE, plus forecasted information through the next rate period.  The annual update process includes formula rate protocols that provide disclosure of cost inputs, an opportunity for informal discovery procedures and a challenge process, which provides transparency to stakeholders. \nFrom time to time, various matters are pending before FERC relating to transmission rates, incentives, interconnections and transmission planning. Depending on the outcome, any of these matters could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition.  At this time, Eversource cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the matters currently pending before FERC, and the resulting impact on its transmission incentives or planning.\n40\nRegulatory Developments and Rate Matters\nElectric, Natural Gas and Water Utility Retail Tariff Rates:  \nEach Eversource utility subsidiary is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the state in which it operates:  CL&P, Yankee Gas and Aquarion operate in Connecticut and are subject to PURA regulation; NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Aquarion operate in Massachusetts and are subject to DPU regulation; and PSNH and Aquarion operate in New Hampshire and are subject to NHPUC regulation.  The regulated companies' distribution rates are set by their respective state regulatory commissions, and their tariffs include mechanisms for periodically adjusting their rates for the recovery of specific incurred costs.  \nBase Distribution Rates:\n  \nIn Connecticut, PURA is required to conduct a review and investigation of the financial and operating records of each electric, natural gas and water utility serving more than seventy-five thousand customers within four years of its last general rate hearing.  PURA can elect to convene a general rate hearing at an interval of less than four years unless prohibited from doing so by an agency decision or other law.  In Massachusetts, electric distribution companies are required to file distribution rate schedules every five years, and natural gas local distribution companies to file distribution rate schedules every 10 years, and those companies are limited to one settlement agreement in any 10-year period.  Aquarion is not required to initiate a rate review with the DPU.  In New Hampshire, PSNH is not required to initiate a rate review with the NHPUC on any set timeframe, and the NHPUC has no obligation to hear any rate matter that it has investigated within a period of two years, though it may elect to do so at its discretion.\nRate Reconciling Mechanisms:\n \nThe Eversource electric distribution companies obtain and resell power to retail customers who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH enter into full requirements energy supply procurement contracts for its customers that choose to purchase power from the electric distribution company (standard offer, basic service or default energy service, respectively).  The natural gas distribution companies procure natural gas for firm and seasonal customers.  These energy supply and natural gas supply procurement costs are recovered from customers in supply rates that are approved by the respective state regulatory commission.  The rates are reset periodically (every six months for electric residential customers) and are fully reconciled to their costs.  New energy supply rates for residential customers are established effective July 1st at CL&P and NSTAR Electric and effective August 1st at PSNH.  Each electric and natural gas distribution company fully recovers its energy supply costs through approved regulatory rate mechanisms on a timely basis and, therefore, such costs have no impact on earnings.  Increases or decreases in energy supply retail rates result in corresponding fluctuations in both energy supply procurement revenues and purchased power or purchased natural gas expenses on the statements of income.\nThe electric and natural gas distribution companies also recover certain other costs from customers in retail rates on a fully reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, recovery of these costs has no impact on earnings.  Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, state mandated energy purchase agreements and other energy-related costs, electric retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, electric restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues (including securitized RRB charges), certain capital tracking mechanisms for infrastructure improvements, and additionally for the Massachusetts utilities, pension and PBOP benefits, net metering for distributed generation, and solar-related programs.  The reconciliation filings compare the total actual costs allowed to revenue requirements related to these services and the difference between the costs incurred (or the rate recovery allowed) and the actual costs allowed is deferred and included, to be either recovered or refunded, in future customer rates.  These cost tracking mechanisms also include certain incentives earned, return on capital tracking mechanisms, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings. \nConnecticut:  \nCL&P Performance Based Rate Making:\n  On May 26, 2021, in accordance with an October 2020 Connecticut law, PURA opened a proceeding to begin to evaluate and eventually implement performance-based regulation (PBR) for electric distribution companies.  PURA is conducting the proceeding in two phases.  On January 25, 2023, PURA staff issued a proposal outlining a suggested portfolio of PBR elements for further exploration and potential implementation in the second phase of the proceeding.  On April 26, 2023, PURA issued a final decision on the first phase and identified various objectives to guide PBR development and evaluate adoption of a PBR framework.  The decision commenced Phase 2 by initiating three reopener dockets focused on revenue adjustment mechanisms, performance metrics and integrated distribution system planning with final decisions expected in 2025.\nOn November 16, 2023, PURA issued a straw proposal in the first reopener that focused on revenue adjustment mechanisms.  The proposal outlines potential additions and reforms to the current revenue adjustment mechanisms, such as multi-year rate plans, earnings sharing mechanisms and the revenue decoupling mechanism.  On March 14, 2024, PURA issued a straw proposal in the second reopener docket which concentrates on performance mechanisms in a PBR framework. The proposal suggests the development of performance incentive mechanisms, reported metrics and scorecards.  These straw proposals are not authoritative and additional technical sessions, hearings and testimony will continue prior to a final decision, which will not be applied until the time of CL&P’s next distribution rate case.  PURA is expected to issue updated straw proposals in the first and second reopener dockets in the first quarter of 2025.\nWe continue to monitor developments in this proceeding, and at this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding and the resulting impact to CL&P. \n41\nCL&P Storm Filings:\n  On March 28, 2024, PURA established a prudency review proceeding for the purpose of receiving and reviewing evidence of the costs reported by CL&P in response to catastrophic storms and pre-staging events totaling approximately $634 million that occurred between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021.  PURA established a partial procedural schedule with hearings scheduled in the third quarter of 2025.  On December 31, 2024, CL&P filed a supplement to its March 2024 prudency review application to request that PURA evaluate the prudence of its costs for nine additional catastrophic storms and two additional pre-staging events for the period January 1, 2022 through January 31, 2023 totaling approximately $173 million.  Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, we continue to believe these deferred storm restoration costs were prudently incurred and are probable of recovery. \nCL&P RAM Filing:\n  On April 17, 2024, PURA issued an interim decision in CL&P’s Rate Adjustment Mechanisms (RAM) filing and approved rates for six RAM components, with rates effective July 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  The rate approvals include the recovery of NBFMCC and SBC net underrecoveries as of December 31, 2023 of $264.9 million and $86.2 million, respectively, and the recovery of expected net costs of $388.5 million for the NBFMCC and $254.4 million for the SBC for the period July 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  The NBFMCC rate adjustment is primarily driven by long-term nuclear power purchase agreements required by state policy (Millstone and Seabrook) and the SBC rate adjustment is primarily driven by costs associated with accounts receivable hardship customer protection and the new low-income discount rate effective December 2023. On August 14, 2024, PURA issued a final decision that approved a further adjustment to the NBFMCC rate to include the recovery of incurred and deferred electric vehicle program costs from 2021 through May 31, 2024 of $44.4 million and expected electric vehicle program costs from June 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 of $24.3 million.  The $44.4 million, plus $5.4 million in carrying costs, will be recovered over a 20-month period of September 1, 2024 through April 30, 2026, and the $24.3 million will be recovered over an eight-month period of September 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  In addition, PURA approved an incremental $3.5 million of 2024 Innovative Energy Solutions program costs and $1.5 million of Connecticut Green Bank program costs over an eight-month period of September 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  These amounts are included in the “Public Benefits” portion of the customer bills in Connecticut.\nCL&P Advanced Metering Infrastructure Filing:\n  On January 3, 2024, PURA issued a final decision regarding CL&P’s Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) investment and implementation plan, which CL&P estimated at $766.4 million for capital costs and operating expenses.  In CL&P’s view, the final decision does not provide a reasonable path for cost recovery and delays implementation by at least a year during the pendency of the cost recovery proceeding.  In addition, in CL&P’s view, the final decision modifies the prudence standard for recovery of costs expended on the project, improperly linking recovery to outcomes not known at the outset of the project.  On January 18, 2024, CL&P submitted a motion for reconsideration to PURA, asking that the agency modify these aspects of the decision, which PURA subsequently denied on February 14, 2024.  On March 6, 2024, CL&P filed written comments citing four major problems associated with PURA’s guidelines for recovery of the costs of AMI implementation, which if not addressed, represent obstacles to AMI implementation in Connecticut.  On April 16, 2024, PURA issued a procedural order directing Eversource and inviting all parties and intervenors to submit pre-filed testimony pertaining to AMI by May 14, 2024, and rebuttal testimony by May 29, 2024.  CL&P witnesses filed testimony, including an updated estimate of $855 million for capital costs and operating expenses, and then subsequently participated in the AMI cost recovery hearing on June 6,\n \n2024.  \nOn October 17, 2024, PURA issued a proposed final decision on recovery of the costs for AMI implementation.  Written exceptions to the proposed final decision were filed on October 31, 2024, and oral arguments were presented on November 7, 2024.  CL&P’s written exceptions focused on three main aspects of the proposed decision, which include (1) clarifying the prudence standard to be used in evaluating AMI investments, (2) timing of prudency reviews, and (3) cost recovery related to incremental O&M expenses.  On December 4, 2024, PURA issued a final decision on the recovery of costs for AMI implementation.  On December 9, 2024, CL&P filed a petition for reconsideration because PURA had not fully resolved the issues CL&P raised in its October 31, 2024 written exceptions.  On January 3, 2025, PURA stated it will evaluate the merits of CL&P’s petition for reconsideration.  Under state law, PURA is expected to issue its decision within 90 days of January 3, 2025.\nYankee Gas Distribution Rate Case:\n  On November 12, 2024, Yankee Gas filed an application with PURA to amend its existing distribution rates for effect on November 1, 2025.  Yankee Gas’s rate application requested approval of a distribution rate increase of $209 million, which included a base distribution rate increase of $274 million, partially offset by a reduction of $65 million in the combined Gas System Improvements and System Expansion Reconciliation rates.  In addition, Yankee Gas requested approval to implement a rate credit of $37.4 million to offset the PGA rate for non-firm margin credits over one year beginning November 1, 2025.  As part of the rate case, Yankee Gas proposed to implement a multi-year performance-based rate making plan with a four-year initial term from November 1, 2025 to October 31, 2029 that would adjust rates annually and includes performance metrics.  A final decision by PURA is expected in October 2025.\nAquarion Water Company of Connecticut Distribution Rate Case:\n  On August 29, 2022, Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut (AWC-CT) filed an application with PURA to amend its existing rate schedules to address an operating revenue deficiency.  AWC-CT’s rate application requested approval of rate increases of $27.5 million, an additional $13.6 million, and an additional $8.8 million, effective March 15, 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively.  On March 15, 2023, PURA issued a final decision that rejected this request.  In this decision, PURA ordered a decrease to total authorized revenues of $4.0 million effective March 15, 2023.  The decision allows an authorized regulatory ROE of 8.70 percent.  On March 30, 2023, AWC-CT filed an appeal on the decision and requested a stay of the decision with the State of Connecticut Superior Court.  On April 5, 2023, the Court temporarily granted AWC-CT’s request to stay and on May 25, 2023 granted a permanent stay of certain orders affecting base rates, which would keep existing rates in place until the appeal is completed.  The stay included the condition that AWC-CT place any revenue received from customers above the rates and amounts authorized in the March 15, 2023 decision in a separate, interest bearing account until further order.  On March 25, 2024, the State of Connecticut Superior Court issued a decision on the appeal which dismissed nine, remanded back to PURA two, and partially remanded one of AWC-CT’s twelve claims of error in its appeal.  On March 28, 2024, AWC-CT filed an appeal of the Connecticut Superior Court decision to the Connecticut Appellate Court, and that appeal was subsequently transferred to the Connecticut Supreme Court for review.  A ruling on the appeal is pending. \n42\nOn April 18, 2024, PURA initiated a docket to address the matters on remand.  On July 31, 2024, PURA issued a final decision in this docket and increased AWC-CT’s approved revenue requirement by $0.1 million above the amount authorized in the March 15, 2023 decision.  Rates went into effect on July 31, 2024.  On September 13, 2024, AWC-CT filed an appeal of PURA’s July 31, 2024 final decision to the Connecticut Superior Court.  A ruling on the appeal is pending.\nAs a result of the State of Connecticut Superior Court’s March 2024 decision on the appeal, AWC-CT recorded the impacts of the PURA rate case decision from the effective date of the order on March 15, 2023 through December 31, 2024.  The impacts primarily include a reduction to depreciation expense to reflect lower depreciation rates ordered by PURA in its final decision, partially offset by lower authorized revenues.  These adjustments resulted in an after-tax benefit of $11.6 million in 2024.  \nMassachusetts:\nNSTAR Electric Distribution Rates\n:  NSTAR Electric’s PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation, exogenous events and future capital additions based on a historical five-year average of total capital additions.  On September 16, 2024, NSTAR Electric submitted its annual PBR Adjustment filing for a $55.8 million increase to base distribution rates, for effect on January 1, 2025.  The requested base distribution rate increase is comprised of a $35.3 million inflation-based adjustment and a $20.5 million adjustment for capital additions based on the difference between the historical five-year average of total capital additions and the base capital revenue requirement. On December 23, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nNSTAR Electric CIP Filing:\n  On December 30, 2022, the DPU approved a provisional system planning tariff for the recovery of costs associated with a capital investment project (CIP) proposal submitted by NSTAR Electric for one of six geographic study areas in its service territory in accordance with DPU’s directives.  The DPU established a new, provisional framework for planning and funding upgrades to the electric power system to foster development and interconnection of distributed energy facilities.  Under the DPU program, NSTAR Electric has filed infrastructure upgrade proposals to be built within a four-year construction timeframe that allocate the costs of interconnection upgrades between the interconnecting distributed generation facility and distribution customers based on a technical analysis of capacity benefits.  Payments made by the distributed generation facility will be applied against the total capital investment made by NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Electric will earn a return on the net investment.  The amount allocated to distribution customers will be recovered through a reconciling mechanism, the Provisional System Planning Tariff.  The DPU approved the first of these provisional system planning projects, the Marion-Fairhaven group study area, which will enable 141 MW of distributed energy resources (DER) to be interconnected at a total estimated cost of $120 million.  Of the total $120 million, $66 million will be allocated to distribution customers, once the enabled distributed energy facilities capacity is fully subscribed by distributed energy facilities interconnecting customers.  Additionally, NSTAR Electric will proceed with construction of approximately $54 million of transmission upgrades necessary to improve local reliability and integrate distribution energy resources in the Marion-Fairhaven area and recover the amount through local transmission rates.\nOn June 4, 2024, the DPU approved four of the remaining five CIPs that were originally submitted by NSTAR Electric.  These included the Plainfield-Blandford CIP, which will enable 40 MW of DER to be interconnected at a total estimated distribution investment of $37 million, the Dartmouth-Westport CIP which enables 60 MW of DER for a total distribution investment of $58 million, the Plymouth CIP which enables 380 MW of DER for a total distribution investment of $152 million and the Cape Cod CIP which enables 296 MW of DER for a total distribution investment of $170 million.  Of the total $417 million for these four recently approved CIPs, $183 million will be allocated to distribution customers, once the enabled distributed energy facilities capacity is fully subscribed by distributed energy facilities interconnecting customers.  Additionally, NSTAR Electric will proceed with construction of approximately $64 million of transmission upgrades necessary to improve local reliability and integrate distribution energy resources in the four CIP areas and recover the amount through local transmission rates.  On January 27, 2025, NSTAR Electric filed a petition with the DPU to withdraw the sixth CIP project, Freetown, that was originally submitted.\nNSTAR Electric’s Electric Sector Modernization Plan (ESMP) Filing\n:  On January 29, 2024, in accordance with Massachusetts state law, NSTAR Electric filed its ESMP with the DPU.  The law required each electric distribution company to develop and file a comprehensive distribution system plan to proactively upgrade the distribution system (and, where applicable, the associated transmission system) to: (i) improve grid reliability, communications and resiliency; (ii) enable increased, timely adoption of renewable energy and distributed energy resources; (iii) promote energy storage and electrification technologies necessary to decarbonize the environment and economy; (iv) prepare for future climate-driven impacts on the transmission and distribution systems; (v) accommodate increased transportation electrification, increased building electrification and other potential future demands on distribution and, where applicable, the transmission system; and (vi) minimize or mitigate impacts on Massachusetts ratepayers, thereby helping the state realize its statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits and sublimits under the law.  NSTAR Electric’s plan meets these requirements by providing a comprehensive view of all the investments required to build a safer, more reliable, more resilient electric distribution system to enable an affordable, equitable clean energy transition taking into account the needs of environmental justice communities.  For the five-year period from 2025 through 2029, the proposed incremental distribution capital investment is $608 million and the incremental distribution expense amount is $211 million.  On August 29, 2024, the DPU approved the overall ESMP for a five-year period commencing July 1, 2025.  \nOn November 21, 2024, the DPU opened a second phase of the proceeding to consider a short-term ESMP-focused cost recovery mechanism and metrics.  In issuing the notice of proceeding, the DPU limited the review of investment in this docket and excluded NSTAR Electric’s ESMP proposals regarding the EV Phase II extension, low and moderate income solar and the new CIPs.  These investments will be reviewed in separate proceedings.  This reduced the amount of company-proposed incremental capital investment to $295 million and the incremental expense to $44 million related to resiliency and grid modernization.  NSTAR Electric filed its proposed tariff and testimony on December 18, 2024, and is currently in the discovery process, which will be followed by hearings and briefing with completion of the proceeding and final orders expected prior to the start of the plan in July 2025.\n43\nNSTAR Gas Distribution Rates:\n  NSTAR Gas’ PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation and exogenous events.  On September 16, 2024, NSTAR Gas submitted its annual PBR Adjustment filing for a $12.7 million increase to base distribution rates for effect on November 1, 2024.  On October 30, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nEGMA Distribution Rates:\n  On November 4, 2024, EGMA submitted a revised filing for its first rate base reset for rates to be effective November 1, 2024, in accordance with an October 7, 2020 EGMA Rate Settlement Agreement approved by the DPU.  The compliance filing was ordered by the DPU on October 31, 2024.  The rate base reset occurring on November 1, 2024 adjusted distribution rates to account for capital additions (including the roll-in of GSEP capital additions), depreciation expense, property taxes, and return on rate base for capital additions placed into service through December 31, 2023.  The total revenue requirement calculated for the first rate base reset is an increase to base distribution rates of $147.8 million, of which $34.0 million is associated with GSEP investments through December 31, 2023.  Under the terms of the Rate Settlement Agreement, EGMA applied a cap on the revenue change effective November 1, 2024, and the amount in excess of the cap will be deferred for recovery through the Local Distribution Adjustment Clause (LDAC) on May 1, 2025, including carrying charges.  After adjusting for the cap, the increase to base distribution rates is $85.6 million effective November 1, 2024 (of which $8.8 million is offset by a reduction in the GSEP revenue requirement and GSEP rate also taking effect on November 1, 2024 for a net distribution rate change on November 1, 2024 of $76.8 million).  Base distribution rates will be increased effective November 1, 2025 to incorporate the $62.2 million remaining revenue requirement.  On November 7, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nFuture of Gas Docket:\n  In October 2020, the DPU opened Docket “DPU 20-80 The Future of Gas” to examine the role of Massachusetts natural gas local distribution companies (LDCs) in helping to meet the state’s 2050 climate goals.  In December 2023, the DPU issued an order for this docket. The DPU will consider and, in some cases, require new processes and analysis for traditional natural gas investments, which may require significant changes to the LDC planning process and business models.  The DPU intends to put policies and structures in place that would protect customers as Massachusetts works to decarbonize the building sector, which may involve subsequent dockets and regulatory proceedings and potentially recasting the role of LDCs in Massachusetts.  The DPU preserved customer choice for energy needs and encouraged further development of decarbonized alternatives, such as the networked geothermal systems that NSTAR Gas is piloting in Framingham, Massachusetts.  \nOn December 29, 2023, Eversource and other LDCs sought formal clarity from the DPU to fully understand the resulting impact to their natural gas businesses and the associated timing of any impacts.  On April 2, 2024, the DPU issued an order responding to the request for clarification indicating that the LDCs shall implement the inclusion of a Non-Gas Pipeline Alternatives (NPA) analysis on all project authorizations effective immediately.  Existing NPA analysis processes will be used until such time a formal stakeholder-based NPA analysis framework is established and approved by the DPU.  Eversource, along with the other LDCs, have engaged a consultant to inform the development of the required NPA framework by conducting a stakeholder engagement process as mandated by the order.  Another component of the order is the submission of climate compliance plans every five years beginning April 1, 2025. The climate compliance plan filings will include the NPA frameworks, along with energy transitions plans including details on the management of embedded infrastructure investments and cost recovery. Eversource along with the LDCs, have also contracted a consultant to model and investigate statewide cost recovery scenarios including under accelerated depreciation rates. \nThe DPU also indicated that NSTAR Gas and EGMA are not required to provide climate compliance performance metrics in the next PBR filing, however would be expected to propose metrics at the latest in the next base distribution rate proceeding.  GHG emissions reporting was not changed from the order, however, effective November of 2024, reporting requirements have changed per the MA DEP and these requirements implement registration and GHG emissions reporting requirements for companies selling and distributing heating fuels to homes and businesses in Massachusetts, including suppliers of natural gas, fuel oil, and propane, and implement a reporting requirement for fuel storage facilities.  \nEversource does not believe there is any indication of an inability to recover costs or risk of impairment of NSTAR Gas’ and EGMA’s natural gas assets at this time. \nNew Hampshire:\nPSNH Distribution Rate Case\n:  On June 11, 2024, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for approval of a temporary annual base distribution rate increase.  On July 31, 2024, the NHPUC approved a settlement agreement that was reached by PSNH, New Hampshire Department of Energy, and the Office of the Consumer Advocate to implement a temporary annual base distribution rate increase of $61.2 million effective August 1, 2024.\nAlso on June 11, 2024, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC to request an increase in permanent base distribution rates of $181.9 million, which is inclusive of the temporary rate increase, and proposed to take effect August 1, 2025.  The temporary rates are subject to reconciliation based on the outcome of the permanent rate case back to the date when temporary rates took effect.  The permanent rate increase request includes $247 million in unrecovered storm costs to be recovered over a five-year period.  As part of the rate case, PSNH proposed to implement a performance-based rate making plan that would adjust rates annually over a four-year term, with a commitment to not file another rate case for at least four years.  The plan includes a revenue-cap formula adjusted for inflation, a supplemental capital adjustment formula to support PSNH’s planned capital infrastructure improvements, an exogenous events recovery mechanism, performance metrics and an earnings sharing mechanism, among others.  If the NHPUC approves the performance-based rate making plan as proposed, the previously established RRA and PPAM rate reconciling mechanisms and lost base revenues will be eliminated.  The NHPUC is permitted up to twelve months to investigate the proposed rates and issue a final order.  A decision by the NHPUC on permanent rates is expected by August 1, 2025.\n44\nLegislative and Policy Matters\nFederal:\n  On April 10, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the final regulation setting drinking water standards for six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) compounds.  The regulation requires compliance under a phased approach in which systems will need to complete the initial monitoring requirements for each PFAS within three years, and when warranted, take steps to assure compliance within five years.  Beginning in 2027, systems will need to report results of initial monitoring and regular monitoring and issue public notifications for any monitoring and reporting violations.  Starting in 2029, systems must comply with all maximum contaminant levels (MCL) and provide public notification for MCL violations.  Eversource is currently evaluating the impacts to comply with the regulation for its water business. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and, at times, difficult, subjective or complex judgments.  Changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our management discusses with the Audit Committee of our Board of Trustees significant matters relating to critical accounting policies.  Our critical accounting policies are discussed below.  See the combined notes to our financial statements for further information concerning the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.    \nRegulatory Accounting\n:  Our regulated companies are subject to rate regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses.  The regulated companies' financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making process.  The rates charged to the customers of our regulated companies are designed to collect each company's costs to provide service, plus a return on investment.  \nWe believe that the operations of each of our regulated companies currently satisfy the criteria for application of regulatory accounting.  If events or circumstances should change in a future period so that those criteria are no longer satisfied, we would be required to eliminate any associated regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact would be recognized in the statement of income and may result in a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition.\nThe application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities.  Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates.  In some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission.  We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery.  We base our conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent.  \nRegulatory liabilities represent either revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.  We make judgments regarding the future outcome of regulatory proceedings that involve potential future refund to customers and record liabilities for these loss contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable based upon available information.  Regulatory liabilities are recorded at the best estimate, or at a low end of the range of possible loss.  The amount recorded may differ from when the uncertainty is resolved.  Such differences could have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nWe continually assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or refund.  This assessment includes consideration of recent orders issued by regulatory commissions, the passage of new legislation, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in each of our jurisdictions, discussions with legal counsel, the status of any appeals of regulatory decisions, and changes in applicable regulatory and political environments.  We believe that we will continue to be able to defer and recover prudently incurred costs, including additional storm costs, based on the legal and regulatory framework.\nWe use judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on our financial statements.  The ultimate outcome of regulatory rate proceedings could have a significant effect on our ability to recover costs or earn an adequate return.  Established rates are also often subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed.  \nStorm restoration and pre-staging costs are subject to prudency reviews from our regulators.  We have $2.10 billion of deferred storm costs that either have yet to be filed with the applicable regulatory commission, are pending regulatory approval, or are subject to prudency review as of December 31, 2024.  Tropical Storm Isaias in August 2020 resulted in deferred storm restoration costs of approximately $232 million at CL&P as of December 31, 2024.  While it is possible that some amount of the Tropical Storm Isaias costs may be disallowed by PURA, any such amount cannot be estimated at this time. We believe that our storm restoration costs were prudently incurred, meet the criteria for cost recovery and are probable of recovery.\nWe believe it is probable that each of our regulated companies will recover its respective investments in long-lived assets and the regulatory assets that have been recorded.  If we determine that we can no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises, or that we cannot conclude it is probable that costs will be recovered from customers in future rates, the applicable costs would be charged to net income in the period in which the determination is made.\n45\nPension, SERP and PBOP:\n  We sponsor Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans to provide retirement benefits to our employees.  Plan assets and the benefit obligation are presented on a net basis and we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet.  These amounts are remeasured annually using a December 31st measurement date.  For each of these plans, several significant assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation, funded status, and net periodic benefit expense/income.  These assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, compensation/progression rate, cash balance interest crediting rate and mortality and retirement assumptions.  We evaluate these assumptions annually and adjust them as necessary.  Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets Assumption\n:  In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we consider historical and expected returns, as well as input from our consultants.  Our expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding expected rates of return for each asset class.  We routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, our expected long-term rate-of-return assumption used to determine our pension and PBOP expense was 8.25 percent for the Eversource Service Pension and PBOP plans.  \nFor the forecasted 2025 pension and PBOP expense, an expected long-term rate of return of 8.25 percent for the Eversource Service Pension and PBOP plans will be used reflecting our target asset allocations.\nDiscount Rate Assumptions\n:  Payment obligations related to the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are discounted at interest rates applicable to the expected timing of each plan's cash flows.  The discount rate that was utilized in determining the pension, SERP and PBOP obligations was based on a yield-curve approach.  This approach utilizes a population of bonds with an average rating of AA based on bond ratings by Moody's, S&P and Fitch, and uses bonds with above median yields within that population.  As of December 31, 2024, the discount rates used to determine the funded status were within a range of 5.6 percent to 5.7 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and 5.7 percent for the PBOP Plans.  As of December 31, 2023, the discount rates used were within a range of 4.9 percent to 5.0 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent for the PBOP Plans.  The increase in the discount rates used to calculate the funded status resulted in a decrease to the Pension and SERP Plans’ projected benefit obligation of $332.9 million and a decrease to the PBOP Plans' projected benefit obligation of $39.8 million as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company uses the spot rate methodology for the service and interest cost components of Pension, SERP and PBOP expense because it provides a relatively precise measurement by matching projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.  The discount rates used to estimate the 2024 expense were within a range of 4.7 percent to 5.1 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and within a range of 4.9 percent to 5.2 percent for the PBOP Plans.  \nMortality Assumptions:\n  Assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and the corresponding plan liability we need to record.  The mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy.  In 2024, our mortality assumption utilized the Society of Actuaries base mortality tables (Pri-2012), adjusted to reflect Eversource’s own mortality experience, and projected generationally using the MP-2021 improvement scale.\nCompensation/Progression Rate Assumptions\n:  This assumption reflects the expected long-term salary growth rate, including consideration of the levels of increases built into collective bargaining agreements, and impacts the estimated benefits that Pension and SERP Plan participants will receive in the future.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the compensation/progression rates used to determine the Pension and SERP Plan funded status were within a range of 3.5 percent to 4.0 percent.     \nHealth Care Cost Assumptions\n:  The Eversource Service PBOP Plan is not subject to health care cost trends.  As of December 31, 2024, for the Aquarion PBOP Plan, the health care trend rate used to determine the funded status for pre-65 retirees is 7.5 percent, with an ultimate rate of 5 percent in 2035, and for post-65 retirees, the health care trend rate and ultimate rate is 3.5 percent. \nCash Balance Interest Crediting Rate Assumption\n:  The Cash Balance Pension Plan is a new, additional obligation of the existing Pension Plan and the liability will begin to accrue benefits upon the effective date of January 1, 2025.  The cash balance interest crediting rate assumption represents the long-term rate by which the Pension Plan’s cash balance accounts are expected to grow.  Actual interest on the cash balance accounts is based on the 30-year U.S. Treasury securities rate in effect for September of the preceding year, with a minimum rate of 4 percent.  The cash balance interest crediting rate assumption used in determining the \nforecasted 2025 pension expense\n was 4.8 percent. \nActuarial Gains and Losses:\n  Actuarial gains and losses represent the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual information or updated assumptions.  Unamortized actuarial gains or losses arising at the December 31st measurement date are primarily from differences in actual investment performance compared to our expected return and changes in the discount rate assumption. The Eversource Service Pension and PBOP Plans use the corridor approach to determine the amount of gain or loss to amortize into net periodic benefit expense/income. The corridor approach defers all actuarial gains and losses arising at remeasurement and the net unrecognized actuarial gain or loss balance is amortized as a component of expense if, as of the beginning of the year, that net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the market value of the plan’s assets or the projected benefit obligation. The amount of net unrecognized actuarial gain or loss in excess of the 10 percent corridor is amortized to expense over the estimated average future employee service period.  For the Eversource Service Pension Plan, the net actuarial gain or loss is amortized as a component of expense over the estimated average future employee service period of eleven years.  For the Eversource Service PBOP Plan, the net unrecognized actuarial gain or loss was within the 10 percent corridor and therefore there was no amortization to expense during 2024. \n46\nA decrease in the discount rate used to determine our pension funded status would increase our projected benefit obligation at December 31st, resulting in a higher unamortized actuarial loss to be recognized in future years’ pension expense, subject to exceeding the 10 percent corridor.  A decrease in the discount rate at December 31st would also result in a decrease in the interest cost component and an increase in the service cost component of the subsequent year’s benefit plan expense. \nThe calculated expected return on plan assets is compared to the actual return or loss on plan assets at the end of each year to determine the investment gains or losses to be immediately reflected in unamortized actuarial gains and losses.  An underperformance of our pension plan investment returns relative to the expected returns would increase our pension liability at December 31st, resulting in a higher unamortized actuarial loss to be recognized in future years’ pension expense, subject to exceeding the 10 percent corridor, and a lower expected return on assets component of pension expense in future years’ pension expense.\nNet Periodic Benefit Expense/Income:\n  Pension, SERP and PBOP expense/income is determined by our actuaries and consists of service cost and prior service cost/credit, interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations, amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and the expected return on plan assets.  For the Pension and SERP Plans, pre-tax net periodic benefit income was $76.8 million, $108.4 million and $181.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  For the PBOP Plans, pre-tax net periodic benefit income was $64.3 million, $57.3 million and $79.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nThe change in pension, SERP and PBOP expense/income arising from the annual remeasurement does not fully impact earnings.  Our Massachusetts utilities recover qualified pension and PBOP expenses related to their distribution operations through a rate reconciling mechanism that fully tracks the change in net pension and PBOP expenses each year, therefore the change in their pension and PBOP expense does not impact earnings.  Our electric transmission companies' rates provide for an annual true-up of estimated to actual costs, which include pension expenses, therefore the change in their pension expense does not impact earnings.  Any differences between the fixed level of PBOP expense included in our formula rate and the PBOP expense calculated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance is accumulated as a regulatory asset or liability, and is expected, over time, to be recovered from or returned to customers. Additionally, the portion of our pension and PBOP expense that relates to company labor devoted to capital projects is capitalized on the balance sheet instead of being charged to expense. \nForecasted Expense/Income and Expected Contributions\n:  We estimate that net periodic benefit income in 2025 for the Pension and SERP Plans will be approximately $93 million and for the PBOP Plans will be approximately $69 million.  The increase in pension income from 2024 to 2025 is driven primarily by lower amortization of actuarial losses, partially offset by an increase in the service cost component, both of which were due in part to the impact of the new cash balance pension plan.  The increase in PBOP income from 2024 to 2025 is driven primarily by favorable expected return on assets due to a higher asset balance.  For the PBOP Plans, there is no amortization of actuarial loss in 2025.  Pension, SERP and PBOP expense/income for subsequent years will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and other assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans. \nOur policy is to fund the Pension Plans annually in an amount at least equal to the amount that will satisfy all federal funding requirements.  Based on the current status of the Pension Plans and federal pension funding requirements, for our Eversource Service Pension Plan there is no minimum funding requirement in 2025 and we do not expect to make pension contributions in 2025.  It is our policy to fund the PBOP Plans annually through tax deductible contributions to external trusts.  We do not expect to make any contributions to the Eversource Service PBOP Plan in 2025.  \nSensitivity Analysis\n:  The following table illustrates the hypothetical effect on reported annual net periodic benefit income as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points:  \nPension Plans (excluding SERP Plans) \nPBOP Plans\nDecrease in Plan Income\nDecrease/(Increase) in Plan Income\n(Millions of Dollars)\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nEversource\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nLower expected long-term rate of return\n$\n28.9 \n$\n29.1 \n$\n5.0 \n$\n0.2 \nLower discount rate\n27.4 \n24.7 \n(0.5)\n4.7 \nHigher compensation rate\n5.9 \n8.1 \nN/A\nN/A\nGoodwill:\n  Goodwill is recognized on our balance sheet from previous mergers and acquisitions to the extent that the consideration paid exceeded the net fair value of the identified assets and liabilities acquired in each business combination.  We are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by considering the fair values of the reporting units, which requires us to use estimates and judgments.  Additionally, we monitor all relevant events and circumstances during the year to determine if an interim impairment test is required.  We have selected October 1st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment test date.  Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.  If goodwill were to be impaired, it would be written down in the current period to the extent of the impairment.  \nWe have identified our reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill as Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution.  The Electric Distribution and Electric Transmission reporting units include carrying values for the respective components of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.  The Natural Gas Distribution reporting unit includes the carrying values of NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas and EGMA.  The Water Distribution reporting unit includes the Aquarion water utility businesses.  As of December 31, 2024, goodwill was allocated to the reporting units as follows: $2.54 billion to Electric Distribution, $577 million to Electric Transmission, and $451 million to Natural Gas Distribution.  Goodwill allocated to Water Distribution of $663 million is classified as held for sale.\n47\nIn assessing goodwill for impairment, an entity is permitted to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists as of the annual impairment test date.  If we perform the qualitative assessment but determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expenses, but the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. \nWe performed the annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2024 for the Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution reporting units.  Our qualitative assessment included an evaluation of multiple factors that impact the fair value of the reporting units, including general, macroeconomic and market conditions, and entity-specific assumptions that affect the future cash flows of the reporting units.  Key considerations include discount rates, utility sector market performance and merger transaction multiples, the Company's share price and credit ratings, analyst reports, financial performance, cost and risk factors, internal estimates and projections of future cash flows and net income, long-term strategy, the timing and outcome of rate cases, and recent regulatory and legislative proceedings.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we concluded that the likely sale of Aquarion at a loss resulted in the requirement to perform an interim goodwill impairment test for Water Distribution goodwill.  We compared the estimated fair value of the business from the anticipated transaction to its carrying value.  Assumptions used in the valuation were the future cash flows from the sale, including the estimated income tax impacts as a result of the transaction.  Based on the interim impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $297 million to write down the carrying value of the water distribution reporting unit to its estimated fair value.   \nWe did not identify any events or conditions that make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred at our other reporting units.  For these remaining reporting units, we believe that the fair value was substantially in excess of carrying value.  Adverse regulatory actions, changes in the regulatory and political environment, or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future goodwill impairment indicators.\nLong-Lived Assets:\n  Impairment evaluations of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other assets, involve a significant degree of estimation and judgment, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist.  An impairment analysis is required when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.  Indicators of potential impairment include a deteriorating business climate, unfavorable regulatory action, decline in value that is other than temporary in nature, plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life, and accumulation of costs that are in excess of amounts allowed for recovery.  The review of long-lived assets for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about operating strategies and external developments, including assessment of current and projected market conditions that can impact future cash flows.  If indicators are present for a long-lived asset or asset group, a comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value is performed.  No significant impairments occurred during the year 2024. \nEquity Method Investments:\n Investments in affiliates where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee are initially recognized as an equity method investment at cost.  Any differences between the cost of an investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets of an investee are considered basis differences and are determined based upon the estimated fair values of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities.  \nEquity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist as of the balance sheet date that indicate that the fair value of the investment may be less than book value.  Eversource continually monitors and evaluates its equity method investments to determine if there are indicators of an other-than-temporary impairment.  If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.  Impairment evaluations are based on best information available at the impairment assessment date.  Subsequent declines or recoveries after the reporting date are not considered in the impairment recognized. Investments that are other-than-temporarily impaired and written down to their estimated fair value cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value.  Impairment evaluations involve a significant degree of judgment and estimation, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist at the equity method investment level, selecting discount rates used to determine fair values, and developing an estimate of discounted future cash flows expected from investment operations or the sale of the investment.\nDuring 2023, in connection with the process to divest its offshore wind business, Eversource identified indicators for impairment in both the second and fourth quarters of 2023.  In each impairment assessment, Eversource evaluated its investments and determined that the carrying value of the equity method offshore wind investments exceeded the fair value of the investments and that the decline was other-than-temporary.  The impairment evaluations involved judgments in developing the estimates and timing of future cash flows, including key judgments in determining the most likely outcome of the projects, the likelihood of realization of investment tax credit adders, and the likelihood of future spending amounts and cost overruns, as well as potential cancellation costs and salvage values of Sunrise Wind assets.  The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses were subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity. The use of different assumptions, estimates, or judgments with respect to the\nestimation of future cash flows could have materially changed the impairment charges. The impairment charges were non-cash charges and did not impact Eversource’s cash position at the time of the impairment.  During 2024, Eversource sold its interest in the North East Offshore and South Fork Class B, Member LLC equity method investments and recognized an aggregate, net after-tax loss on the sale of its offshore wind investments of $524 million.\nLoss Contingencies:\n We make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record liabilities for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information.  The assessment of loss contingencies involves judgments and assumptions about future events.  Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information. The amount recorded may differ from the actual expense incurred when the uncertainty is resolved.  Such difference would be a change in estimate and could have a significant impact on the financial statements.  \n48\nUpon the sales of our offshore wind investments in the third quarter of 2024, Eversource recorded a contingent liability of $365 million, reflecting its estimate of the future obligations under the GIP sale terms.  Assumptions and key judgments in determining the estimated liability include the expected cost overrun sharing obligation, expected obligation to maintain GIP’s internal rate of return, and obligation for other future costs, as well as the likelihood of realization of investment tax credit adders that were included in the purchase price.  The use of different assumptions, estimates, or judgments could materially impact the financial statements.  New information or future developments that arise as construction progresses and as cost estimates are reviewed and revised will require a reassessment of the estimated liability for the post-closing adjustment payments. Adverse changes in facts and circumstances could result in additional losses that could be material to the financial statements. \nAccounting for Environmental Reserves:\n  Environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated.  Increases to estimates of environmental liabilities could have an adverse impact on earnings. We estimate these liabilities based on findings through various phases of the assessment, considering the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options (ranging from no action required to full site remediation and long-term monitoring), current site information from our site assessments, remediation estimates from third party engineering and remediation contractors, and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites.  If a most likely action plan cannot yet be determined, we estimate the liability based on the low end of a range of possible action plans.  A significant portion of our environmental sites and reserve amounts relate to former MGP sites that were operated several decades ago and manufactured natural gas from coal and other processes, which resulted in certain by-products remaining in the environment that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment, for which we may have potential liability.  Estimates are based on the expected remediation plan.  Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information from other sources, including the level of contamination at the site, the extent of our responsibility or the extent of remediation required, recently enacted laws and regulations or a change in cost estimates.  \nIncome Taxes:\n Income tax expense is estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and is recorded each quarter using an estimated annualized effective tax rate.  This process to record income tax expense involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax return reporting purposes.  Such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses, as well as any impact of permanent differences, or other items that directly impact income tax expense as a result of regulatory activity (flow-through items).  The temporary differences and flow-through items result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the balance sheets.\nWe also account for uncertainty in income taxes, which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets.  The determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under applicable accounting guidance is based on facts and circumstances available to us.   \nThe interpretation of tax laws and associated regulations involves uncertainty since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently.  Ultimate resolution or clarification of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances.  We evaluate the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and our intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets.  We also assess negative evidence, such as the expiration of historical operating loss or tax credit carryforwards, that could indicate the inability to realize the deferred tax assets.  Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized in future periods.  This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income, and the impact of tax planning strategies.\nActual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including future changes in income tax laws, not realizing expected tax planning strategy amounts, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. \nFair Value Measurements:\n  We follow fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price).  We have applied this guidance to our Company's derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as \"normal purchases” or “normal sales,” to marketable securities held in trusts, and to our investments in our Pension and PBOP Plans.  Fair value measurements are also incorporated into the accounting for goodwill, long-lived assets, equity method investments, AROs, and in the valuation of business combinations and asset acquisitions.  The fair value measurement guidance was also applied in estimating the fair value of preferred stock, long-term debt and RRBs.\nChanges in fair value of our derivative contracts are recorded as Regulatory Assets or Liabilities, as we recover the costs of these contracts in rates charged to customers.  These valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy-related products in future years and assumptions made.  \nWe use quoted market prices when available to determine the fair value of financial instruments.  When quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available, we value derivative contracts using models that incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs.  Discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts, reflecting risk-adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using available historical market transaction information.  Valuations of derivative contracts also reflect our estimates of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. \n49\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS – EVERSOURCE ENERGY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items in the statements of income for Eversource for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K: \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nOperating Revenues\n$\n11,900.8 \n$\n11,910.7 \n$\n(9.9)\nOperating Expenses:\n \n \n \nPurchased Power, Purchased Natural Gas and Transmission\n3,736.1 \n5,168.2 \n(1,432.1)\nOperations and Maintenance\n2,012.9 \n1,895.7 \n117.2 \nDepreciation\n1,433.5 \n1,305.8 \n127.7 \nAmortization\n342.9 \n(490.1)\n833.0 \nEnergy Efficiency Programs\n671.8 \n691.4 \n(19.6)\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\n997.9 \n940.4 \n57.5 \nLoss on Pending Sale of Aquarion\n297.0 \n— \n297.0 \nTotal Operating Expenses\n9,492.1 \n9,511.4 \n(19.3)\nOperating Income\n2,408.7 \n2,399.3 \n9.4 \nInterest Expense\n1,111.3 \n855.4 \n255.9 \nLosses on Offshore Wind Investments\n464.0 \n2,167.0 \n(1,703.0)\nOther Income, Net\n410.5 \n348.1 \n62.4 \nIncome/(Loss) Before Income Tax Expense\n1,243.9 \n(275.0)\n1,518.9 \nIncome Tax Expense\n424.7 \n159.7 \n265.0 \nNet Income/(Loss)\n819.2 \n(434.7)\n1,253.9 \nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n7.5 \n7.5 \n— \nNet Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$\n811.7 \n$\n(442.2)\n$\n1,253.9 \nOperating Revenues\nSales Volumes:\n  A summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes, our firm natural gas MMcf sales volumes, and our water MG sales volumes, and percentage changes, is as follows:  \nElectric\nFirm Natural Gas\nWater\n \nSales Volumes (GWh)\nPercentage\nIncrease\nSales Volumes (MMcf)\nPercentage\nIncrease\nSales Volumes (MG)\nPercentage\nIncrease\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nTraditional\n7,807 \n7,590 \n2.9 \n%\n— \n— \n— \n%\n1,669 \n1,488 \n12.2 \n%\nDecoupled\n43,516 \n41,978 \n3.7 \n%\n147,293 \n142,328 \n3.5 \n%\n24,308 \n23,129 \n5.1 \n%\nTotal Sales Volumes\n51,323 \n49,568 \n3.5 \n%\n147,293 \n142,328 \n3.5 \n%\n25,977 \n24,617 \n5.5 \n%\nWeather, fluctuations in energy supply rates, conservation measures (including utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs), and economic conditions affect customer energy usage and water consumption.  Industrial sales volumes are less sensitive to temperature variations than residential and commercial sales volumes.  In our service territories, weather impacts both electric and water sales volumes during the summer and both electric and natural gas sales volumes during the winter; however, natural gas sales volumes are more sensitive to temperature variations than electric sales volumes.  Customer heating or cooling usage may not directly correlate with historical levels or with the level of degree-days that occur.\nFluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at PSNH impact earnings (\"Traditional\" in the table above).  For CL&P, NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, EGMA, Yankee Gas, and our Connecticut water distribution business, fluctuations in retail sales volumes do not materially impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission-approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms (\"Decoupled\" in the table above).  These distribution revenues are decoupled from their customer sales volumes, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized.\nOperating Revenues:\n  The variance in Operating Revenues by segment in 2024, as compared to 2023, is as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nElectric Distribution\n$\n93.0 \nNatural Gas Distribution\n(117.8)\nElectric Transmission\n205.1 \nWater Distribution\n(3.2)\nOther\n64.7 \nEliminations\n(251.7)\nTotal Operating Revenues\n$\n(9.9)\n50\nElectric and Natural Gas Distribution Revenues\n:\nBase Distribution Revenues:\n•\nBase electric distribution revenues increased $141.1 million due primarily to a base distribution rate increase at NSTAR Electric effective January 1, 2024 and a temporary base distribution rate increase at PSNH effective August 1, 2024.\n•\nBase natural gas distribution revenues increased $49.2 million due primarily to base distribution rate increases effective November 1, 2024 at EGMA and effective November 1, 2024 and November 1, 2023 at NSTAR Gas.\nNSTAR Electric’s PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation, exogenous events and future capital additions based on a historical five-year average of total capital additions.  On December 26, 2023, the DPU approved a $104.9 million increase to NSTAR Electric’s base distribution rates effective January 1, 2024.  \nOn July 31, 2024, the NHPUC approved a settlement agreement to implement a temporary annual base distribution rate increase of $61.2 million effective August 1, 2024 at PSNH.\nNSTAR Gas’ PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation and exogenous events.  On October 30, 2023, the DPU approved a $25.4 million increase to NSTAR Gas’ base distribution rates, of which, $15.5 million was associated with a base rate adjustment and the remainder for a prior period exogenous cost adjustment, for effect on November 1, 2023.   On October 30, 2024, the DPU approved a $12.7 million increase to NSTAR Gas’ base distribution rates effective November 1, 2024.\nEGMA was allowed two rate base resets in a DPU-approved October 7, 2020 rate settlement agreement, with the first rate base reset on November 1, 2024. The increase to base distribution rates was $85.6 million effective November 1, 2024 (of which $8.8 million is offset by a reduction in the GSEP revenue requirement and GSEP rate also taking effect on November 1, 2024 for a net distribution rate change on November 1, 2024 of $76.8 million). \nTracked Distribution Revenues:\n  Tracked distribution revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in retail rates on a fully reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, recovery of these costs has no impact on earnings.  Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, energy supply and natural gas supply procurement, state mandated energy purchase agreements and other energy-related costs, electric retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, electric restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues (including securitized RRB charges), certain capital tracking mechanisms for infrastructure improvements, and additionally for the Massachusetts utilities, pension and PBOP benefits, net metering for distributed generation, and solar-related programs.  Revenues from certain of these cost tracking mechanisms also include certain incentives earned, return on capital tracking mechanisms, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings.  Tracked revenues also include wholesale market sales transactions, such as sales of energy and energy-related products into the ISO-NE wholesale electricity market, sales of natural gas to third party marketers, and the sale of RECs to various counterparties.\nCustomers have the choice to purchase electricity from their Eversource electric utility or from a competitive third party supplier.  For customers who have contracted separately with these competitive suppliers, revenue is not recorded for the sale of the electricity commodity, as the utility is acting as an agent on behalf of the third party supplier.  For customers that choose to purchase electric generation from CL&P, NSTAR Electric or PSNH, each utility purchases power on behalf of, and is permitted to recover the related energy supply cost without mark-up from, its customers, and records offsetting amounts in revenues and purchased power related to this energy supply procurement.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each remain as the distribution service provider for all customers and charge a regulated rate for distribution delivery service recorded in revenues.  Certain eligible natural gas customers may elect to purchase natural gas from their Eversource natural gas utility or may contract separately with a\ngas supply operator.  Revenue is not recorded for the sale of the natural gas commodity to customers who have contracted separately with these\noperators, only the delivery to a customer, as the utility is acting as an agent on behalf of the gas supply operator.  \nThe variance in tracked distribution revenues in 2024, as compared to 2023 is due primarily to the following:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nElectric Distribution\nNatural Gas Distribution\nRetail Tariff Tracked Revenues:\nEnergy supply procurement\n$\n(1,239.6)\n$\n(165.2)\nCL&P NBFMCC\n544.9 \n— \nNSTAR Electric net metering\n133.1 \n— \nStranded costs\n127.1 \n— \nRetail transmission\n98.9 \n— \nCL&P System Benefit Charge\n88.4 \n— \nOther distribution tracking mechanisms\n159.2 \n44.0 \nWholesale Market Sales Revenue\n33.9 \n(44.8)\nFluctuations in retail tariff tracked revenues are driven by adjustments to retail rates to recover costs and changes in sales volumes.\nThe decrease in energy supply procurement within electric distribution was driven by lower average prices and lower average supply-related sales volumes.  The decrease in energy supply procurement within natural gas distribution was driven by lower average prices, partially offset by higher average supply-related sales volumes.\n51\nThe increase in CL&P’s NBFMCC revenues was driven by an increase in the retail Non-Bypassable Federally Mandated Congestion Charge (NBFMCC) rate.  The CL&P NBFMCC rate includes the recovery of costs incurred under long-term state mandated energy purchase contracts with the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear power plants, net of the benefits received from selling this energy into the ISO-NE wholesale market.  Effective January 1, 2023, CL&P reduced the average NBFMCC rate to a credit of $0.01524 per kWh.  The rate reduction returned to customers the net benefits of higher wholesale market sales received in the ISO-NE market for these energy contracts.  The average NBFMCC rate changed to $0.00000 per kWh effective July 1, 2023 and then to $0.00293 per kWh effective September 1, 2023.  As a result of the April 2024 interim decision in the 2024 CL&P RAM filing, the average NBFMCC rate increased to $0.03906 per kWh effective July 1, 2024.  As a result of the August final decision in the 2024 CL&P RAM filing, the average NBFMCC rate increased to $0.04290 per kWh effective September 1, 2024.  The rate increases primarily resulted from higher net costs associated with power purchase agreements with the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear power plants.\nCL&P is required by regulation to purchase electric generation from Millstone and Seabrook under PURA-approved PPAs entered into in 2019.  CL&P does not have legislative authority to use this purchased output to serve its customer load and therefore sells the energy into the wholesale market and uses the proceeds from the energy sales to offset the contract costs.  The net cost or net sales amount is recovered from, or refunded to, customers in the non-bypassable component of the CL&P FMCC rate. \nElectric Transmission Revenues\n:  Electric transmission revenues increased $205.1 million due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and the impact of the annual rate reconciliation filing with FERC.\nOther Revenues and Eliminations:\n  Other revenues primarily include the revenues of Eversource's service company, most of which are eliminated in consolidation.  Eliminations are also related to the Eversource electric transmission revenues that are derived from ISO-NE regional transmission charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that recover the costs of the wholesale transmission business in rates charged to their customers.\nPurchased Power, Purchased Natural Gas and Transmission\n expense includes costs associated with providing electric generation service\nsupply and natural gas to all customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers, the cost of energy purchase contracts entered into as\nrequired by regulation, and transmission costs.  These electric and natural gas supply procurement costs, other energy-related costs, and\ntransmission costs are recovered from customers in rates through commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on\nearnings (tracked costs).  The variance in Purchased Power, Purchased Natural Gas and Transmission expense in 2024, as compared to 2023, is due primarily to the following:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nEnergy supply procurement costs\n$\n(1,243.2)\nOther electric distribution costs\n130.6 \nNatural gas supply costs\n(218.8)\nTransmission costs\n77.8 \nEliminations\n(178.5)\nTotal Purchased Power, Purchased Natural Gas and Transmission\n$\n(1,432.1)\nThe variance in energy supply procurement costs is offset in Operating Revenues (tracked energy supply procurement revenues).  The variance in other electric distribution costs is due to higher long-term contractual energy-related costs that are recovered in the non-bypassable component of the FMCC mechanism at CL&P, higher net metering costs and an increase in long-term renewable contract costs at NSTAR Electric, partially offset by a decrease in long-term renewable energy purchase contract costs at PSNH.\nCosts at the natural gas distribution segment relate to supply procurement costs for retail customers.  Total natural gas costs decreased due primarily to a decrease in the retail cost deferral and lower average prices, partially offset by higher average purchased volumes.\nThe increase in transmission costs was primarily the result of an increase in costs billed by ISO-NE that support regional grid investments and an increase in Local Network Service charges, which reflect the cost of transmission service provided by Eversource over our local transmission network.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual cost of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers.\n52\nOperations and Maintenance\n expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base electric, natural gas and water distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs).  The variance in Operations and Maintenance expense in 2024, as compared to 2023, is due primarily to the following:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nBase Electric Distribution (Non-Tracked Costs):\nEmployee-related expenses (including labor and benefits)\n$\n22.7 \nUncollectible expense\n14.9 \nShared corporate costs (including IT system depreciation at Eversource Service)\n11.2 \nOperations-related expenses (including vegetation management, vendor services, vehicles and materials)\n6.3 \nGeneral costs (including vendor services in corporate areas, insurance, fees and assessments)\n3.8 \nStorm-related costs\n(4.5)\nTotal Base Electric Distribution (Non-Tracked Costs)\n54.4 \nTracked Electric Costs (Electric Distribution and Electric Transmission) - Increase due primarily to higher transmission expense,  increases in grid modernization and pension tracking mechanisms at NSTAR Electric, and higher uncollectible expense\n98.0 \nTotal Electric Distribution and Electric Transmission\n152.4 \nNatural Gas Distribution:\nBase (Non-Tracked Costs) - Decrease due primarily to lower uncollectible expense\n(14.2)\nTracked Costs\n11.0 \nTotal Natural Gas Distribution \n(3.2)\nWater Distribution\n3.8 \nEversource Parent and Other Companies - other operations and maintenance\n26.8 \nEliminations\n(62.6)\nTotal Operations and Maintenance\n$\n117.2 \nDepreciation\n expense increased due \nprimarily to higher net plant in service balances.\nAmortization \nexpense includes the deferral of energy-related costs and other costs that are included in certain regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms.  This deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues compared to the actual costs incurred.  These costs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.  Amortization expense also includes the amortization of cert\nain costs as those costs are collected in rates. \nThe variance in Amortization is due primarily to the deferral adjustment of energy-related and other tracked costs at CL&P (included in the non-bypassable component of the FMCC mechanism), NSTAR Electric and PSNH, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs.  The CL&P non-bypassable FMCC retail rate increased in 2024 as compared to 2023, and the higher collections lowered the regulatory under-recovery deferral adjustment, resulting in an increase to amortization expense of \n$548.5 million.  \nAmortization expense also increased at NSTAR Electric as a result of \nan increase in storm costs recovered in rates and\n increased  at PSNH due to the absence of a 2023 benefit related to the establishment of a new regulatory tracking mechanism that allowed for the recovery of previously incurred operating expenses associated with poles acquired from Consolidated Communications on May 1, 2023.  The establishment of the PPAM regulatory asset resulted in a pre-tax benefit of $16.9 million recorded in Amortization expense on the statement of income in 2023.\nEnergy Efficiency Programs\n expense\n \nincludes costs of various state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs that are recovered from customers in rates, most of which have no impact on earnings. \n Energy Efficiency Programs expense includes a \ndeferral adjustment that reflects the actual costs of energy efficiency programs compared to the amounts billed to customers, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs. \nEnergy Efficiency Programs \nexpense \ndecreased \ndue primarily to the deferral adjustment, partially offset by higher program spending. \nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\n expense increased due primarily to higher property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances and higher Connecticut gross earnings taxes. \nLoss on Pending Sale of Aquarion \nrelates to the impairment charge recorded in 2024 to write down the carrying value of the water business to fair value resulting from the expected sale of Aquarion.  For further information, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Pending Sale of Aquarion\" included in this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\nInterest Expense\n increased due primarily to an increase in interest on long-term debt as a result of debt issuances ($220.7 million), higher interest on short-term notes payable due to increased borrowings ($16.0 million), an increase in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($15.8 million), and higher amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($4.1 million), partially offset by an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to debt funds and other capitalized interest ($3.2 million), and a decrease in RRB interest expense ($1.4 million).\nLosses on Offshore Wind Investments\n \nrelates to the loss recorded on the 2024 sales of our equity method offshore wind investments and the impairment charge in 2023 resulting from the expected sales of these offshore wind investments.  See \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Offshore Wind Business\" included in this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nfor further information.  \n53\nOther Income, Net\n increased due primarily to an increase in interest income primarily from regulatory deferrals ($44.0 million), an increase in equity in earnings related to Eversource’s equity method investments ($36.4 million), an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to equity funds ($19.7 million), investment income in 2024 compared to investment losses in 2023 driven by market volatility ($5.5 million) and a gain on the sale of an unregulated water business in 2024 ($4.4 million), partially offset by a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($17.5 million).  The variance in Other Income, Net was also due to the absence in 2024 of a benefit in 2023 from the liquidation of Eversource’s equity method investment in a renewable energy fund in excess of its carrying value, partially offset by a charitable contribution made with a portion of the proceeds from the liquidation in 2023, as well as the absence in 2024 of a loss on the abandonment of land in 2023.  \nIncome Tax Expense\n increased due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($319.0 million), a decrease in amortization of EDIT ($14.5 million), a higher share-based payment tax deficiency ($1.8 million), and an increase in items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($28.3 million).  This was partially offset by a decrease in reserves ($9.0 million) primarily related to the loss on sales of Eversource’s offshore wind investments in 2024 compared to the impairment on these investments in 2023, lower state taxes ($49.3 million), and lower return to provision adjustments ($40.3 million).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS – \nTHE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY\nNSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items in the statements of income for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\nOperating Revenues\n$\n4,615.0 \n$\n4,578.8 \n$\n36.2 \n$\n3,720.9 \n$\n3,515.5 \n$\n205.4 \n$\n1,294.5 \n$\n1,447.9 \n$\n(153.4)\nOperating Expenses:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPurchased Power and Transmission\n1,836.9 \n2,612.9 \n(776.0)\n1,045.3 \n1,154.0 \n(108.7)\n244.4 \n605.0 \n(360.6)\nOperations and Maintenance\n815.3 \n733.3 \n82.0 \n735.0 \n668.5 \n66.5 \n288.3 \n284.4 \n3.9 \nDepreciation\n406.5 \n376.9 \n29.6 \n407.7 \n372.6 \n35.1 \n154.1 \n140.4 \n13.7 \nAmortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net\n104.5 \n(500.3)\n604.8 \n130.9 \n16.1 \n114.8 \n136.1 \n(16.3)\n152.4 \nEnergy Efficiency Programs\n171.7 \n133.5 \n38.2 \n263.4 \n325.6 \n(62.2)\n42.9 \n39.6 \n3.3 \nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes\n419.6 \n401.1 \n18.5 \n280.3 \n256.1 \n24.2 \n96.9 \n93.9 \n3.0 \nTotal Operating Expenses\n3,754.5 \n3,757.4 \n(2.9)\n2,862.6 \n2,792.9 \n69.7 \n962.7 \n1,147.0 \n(184.3)\nOperating Income\n860.5 \n821.4 \n39.1 \n858.3 \n722.6 \n135.7 \n331.8 \n300.9 \n30.9 \nInterest Expense\n231.0 \n193.4 \n37.6 \n222.7 \n189.2 \n33.5 \n77.8 \n72.8 \n5.0 \nOther Income, Net\n77.6 \n61.6 \n16.0 \n191.4 \n164.1 \n27.3 \n31.1 \n26.6 \n4.5 \nIncome Before Income Tax Expense\n707.1 \n689.6 \n17.5 \n827.0 \n697.5 \n129.5 \n285.1 \n254.7 \n30.4 \nIncome Tax Expense\n194.5 \n170.9 \n23.6 \n190.6 \n153.0 \n37.6 \n70.2 \n59.0 \n11.2 \nNet Income\n$\n512.6 \n$\n518.7 \n$\n(6.1)\n$\n636.4 \n$\n544.5 \n$\n91.9 \n$\n214.9 \n$\n195.7 \n$\n19.2 \nOperating Revenues\nSales Volumes:\n  A summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes is as follows:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nIncrease\nPercentage\nIncrease\nCL&P \n20,151 \n19,577 \n574 \n2.9 \n%\nNSTAR Electric\n23,365 \n22,401 \n964 \n4.3 \n%\nPSNH\n7,807 \n7,590 \n217 \n2.9 \n%\nFluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at PSNH impact earnings.  For CL&P and NSTAR Electric, fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes do not impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission-approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms.\nOperating Revenues:\n  Operating Revenues, which consist of base distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, increased $36.2 million at CL&P and $205.4 million at NSTAR Electric and decreased $153.4 million at PSNH in 2024, as compared to 2023.\nBase Distribution Revenues:\n•\nCL&P's distribution revenues were flat.\n•\nNSTAR Electric's distribution revenues increased $105.3 million due primarily to a base distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2024.\n•\nPSNH's distribution revenues increased $35.8 million due primarily to a temporary base distribution rate increase effective August 1, 2024.\n54\nTracked Distribution Revenues: \n Tracked distribution revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in retail rates on a fully reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, recovery of these costs has no impact on earnings.  Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, energy supply procurement, state mandated energy purchase agreements and other energy-related costs, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, electric restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues (including securitized RRB charges), certain capital tracking mechanisms for infrastructure improvements, and additionally for NSTAR Electric, pension and PBOP benefits, net metering for distributed generation, and solar-related programs.  Revenues from certain of these cost tracking mechanisms also include certain incentives earned, return on capital tracking mechanisms, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings.  Tracked revenues also include wholesale market sales transactions, such as sales of energy and energy-related products into the ISO-NE wholesale electricity market and the sale of RECs to various counterparties.\nCustomers have the choice to purchase electricity from their Eversource electric utility or from a competitive third party supplier.  For customers who have contracted separately with these competitive suppliers, revenue is not recorded for the sale of the electricity commodity, as the utility is acting as an agent on behalf of the third party supplier.  For customers that choose to purchase electric generation from CL&P, NSTAR Electric or PSNH, each utility purchases power on behalf of, and is permitted to recover the related energy supply cost without mark-up from, its customers, and records offsetting amounts in revenues and purchased power related to this energy supply procurement.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each remain as the distribution service provider for all customers and charge a regulated rate for distribution delivery service recorded in revenues.  \nThe variance in tracked distribution revenues in 2024, as compared to 2023, is due primarily to the following:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nRetail Tariff Tracked Revenues:\nEnergy supply procurement\n$\n(710.5)\n$\n(253.9)\n$\n(275.2)\nCL&P NBFMCC\n544.9 \n— \n— \nNSTAR Electric net metering\n— \n133.1 \n— \nStranded costs\n6.6 \n77.7 \n42.8 \nRetail transmission\n(9.8)\n60.2 \n48.5 \nCL&P System Benefit Charge\n88.4 \n— \n— \nOther distribution tracking mechanisms\n69.7 \n77.2 \n12.3 \nWholesale Market Sales Revenue\n62.8 \n(0.7)\n(28.2)\nFluctuations in retail tariff tracked revenues are driven by adjustments to retail rates to recover costs and changes in sales volumes.\nThe decrease in energy supply procurement at CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH was driven by lower average prices and lower average supply-related sales volumes.\nThe increase in CL&P’s NBFMCC revenues was driven by an increase in the retail Non-Bypassable Federally Mandated Congestion Charge (NBFMCC) rate.  The CL&P NBFMCC rate includes the recovery of costs incurred under long-term state mandated energy purchase contracts with the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear power plants, net of the benefits received from selling this energy into the ISO-NE wholesale market.  Effective January 1, 2023, CL&P reduced the average NBFMCC rate to a credit of $0.01524 per kWh.  The rate reduction returned to customers the net benefits of higher wholesale market sales received in the ISO-NE market for these energy contracts.  The average NBFMCC rate changed to $0.00000 per kWh effective July 1, 2023 and then to $0.00293 per kWh effective September 1, 2023.  As a result of the April 2024 interim decision in the 2024 CL&P RAM filing, the average NBFMCC rate increased to $0.03906 per kWh effective July 1, 2024.  As a result of the August final decision in the 2024 CL&P RAM filing, the average NBFMCC rate increased to $0.04290 per kWh effective September 1, 2024.  The rate increases primarily resulted from higher net costs associated with power purchase agreements with the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear power plants.\nCL&P is required by regulation to purchase electric generation from Millstone and Seabrook under PURA-approved PPAs entered into in 2019.  CL&P does not have legislative authority to use this purchased output to serve its customer load and therefore sells the energy into the wholesale market and uses the proceeds from the energy sales to offset the contract costs.  The net cost or net sales amount is recovered from, or refunded to, customers in the non-bypassable component of the CL&P FMCC rate. \nTransmission Revenues:  \nTransmission revenues increased $69.6 million at CL&P, $89.5 million at NSTAR Electric and $46.0 million at PSNH due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and the impact of the annual rate reconciliation filing with FERC.\nEliminations:\n  Eliminations are primarily related to the Eversource electric transmission revenues that are derived from ISO-NE regional transmission charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that recover the costs of the wholesale transmission business in rates charged to their customers.  The impact of eliminations decreased revenues by $86.3 million at CL&P, $86.0 million at NSTAR Electric and $38.2 million at PSNH.\n55\nPurchased Power and Transmission \nexpense includes costs associated with providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers, the cost of energy purchase contracts entered into as required by regulation, and transmission costs.  These energy supply procurement costs, other energy-related costs, and transmission costs are recovered from customers in rates through commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs).  The variance in Purchased Power and Transmission expense in 2024, as compared to 2023, is due primarily to the following: \n(Millions of Dollars)\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nEnergy supply procurement costs\n$\n(710.2)\n$\n(259.9)\n$\n(273.1)\nOther electric distribution costs\n43.6 \n176.6 \n(89.6)\nTransmission costs\n(23.1)\n60.6 \n40.3 \nEliminations\n(86.3)\n(86.0)\n(38.2)\nTotal Purchased Power and Transmission\n$\n(776.0)\n$\n(108.7)\n$\n(360.6)\nThe variance in energy supply procurement costs is offset in Operating Revenues (tracked energy supply procurement revenues).  The variance in other electric distribution costs at CL&P is due to higher long-term contractual energy-related costs that are recovered in the non-bypassable component of the FMCC mechanism, at NSTAR Electric is due to higher net metering costs and an increase in long-term renewable contract costs, and at PSNH is due primarily to a decrease in long-term renewable energy purchase contract costs.\nIncluded in transmission costs are charges that recover the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generation facilities to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.\n•\nThe decrease in transmission costs at CL&P was due primarily to a decrease resulting from the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual costs of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers.  The decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs billed by ISO-NE that support regional grid investments and an increase in Local Network Service charges, which reflect the cost of transmission service provided by Eversource over our local transmission network.\n•\nThe increase in transmission costs at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to an increase resulting from the retail transmission cost deferral, an increase in costs billed by ISO-NE, and an increase in Local Network Service charges.\n•\nThe increase in transmission costs at PSNH was due primarily to an increase in costs billed by ISO-NE and an increase in Local Network Service charges.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease resulting from the retail transmission cost deferral. \nOperations and Maintenance\n expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs).  The variance in Operations and Maintenance expense in 2024, as compared to 2023, is due primarily to the following:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nBase Electric Distribution (Non-Tracked Costs):\n \nEmployee-related expenses (including labor and benefits)\n$\n13.0 \n$\n7.8 \n$\n1.9 \nUncollectible expense\n5.4 \n11.2 \n(1.7)\nShared corporate costs (including IT system depreciation at Eversource Service)\n5.1 \n4.0 \n2.1 \nOperations-related expenses (including vegetation management, vendor services, vehicles and materials)\n3.8 \n4.5 \n(2.0)\nStorm-related costs\n(2.2)\n3.5 \n(5.8)\nGeneral costs (including vendor services in corporate areas, insurance, fees and assessments)\n(11.8)\n3.6 \n12.0 \nTotal Base Electric Distribution (Non-Tracked Costs)\n13.3 \n34.6 \n6.5 \nTotal Tracked Costs - Increase at CL&P due to higher uncollectible expense and at NSTAR Electric due to an increase in grid modernization costs\n68.7 \n31.9 \n(2.6)\nTotal Operations and Maintenance\n$\n82.0 \n$\n66.5 \n$\n3.9 \nDepreciation\n expense increased for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH due to higher net plant in service balances. \nAmortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net \nexpense includes the deferral of energy-related costs and other costs that are included in certain regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms.  This deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues compared to the actual costs incurred.  These costs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.  Amortization expense also includes the amortization of certain costs as those costs are collected in rates.  The variance in Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net is due primarily to the following:  \n•\nThe variance at CL&P was due primarily to the deferral adjustment of energy-related and other tracked costs that are included in the non-bypassable component of the FMCC mechanism, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs.  The CL&P non-bypassable FMCC retail rate increased in 2024 as compared to 2023, and the higher collections lowered the regulatory under-recovery deferral adjustment recorded in the same\n period\n, resulting in an increase to amortization expense of \n$548.5 million. \n•\nThe increase in expense at NSTAR Electric was due to the deferral adjustment of \nenergy-related and other \ntracked costs that are included in the transition and solar facilities regulatory mechanisms, and higher amortization of storm costs recovered in rates\n. \n56\n•\nThe increase in expense at PSNH was due to the deferral adjustment of energy-related and other tracked costs that are included in the stranded cost recovery charge regulatory mechanism and the absence of a 2023 benefit related to the establishment of a new regulatory tracking mechanism that allowed for the recovery of previously incurred operating expenses associated with poles acquired from Consolidated Communications on May 1, 2023. The establishment of the PPAM regulatory asset resulted in a pre-tax benefit of $16.9 million recorded in Amortization expense on the PSNH statement of income in 2023. \nEnergy Efficiency Programs \nexpense\n \nincludes costs of various state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs that are recovered from customers in rates, most of which have no impact on earnings. \n Energy Efficiency Programs expense includes a \ndeferral adjustment that reflects the actual costs of energy efficiency programs compared to the amounts billed to customers, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs.  The variance in Energy Efficiency Programs expense\n \nis due primarily to the following:\n•\nThe increase at CL&P was due to the deferral adjustment and higher program spending.\n•\nThe decrease at NSTAR Electric was due to the deferral adjustment, partially offset by higher program spending. \n•\nThe increase at PSNH was due to higher program spending, partially offset by the deferral adjustment.\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes - \nthe variance is due primarily to the following:\n•\nThe increase at CL&P was due to higher Connecticut gross earnings taxes and higher property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances. \n•\nThe increase at NSTAR Electric was due to higher property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances and higher assessments. \n•\nThe increase at PSNH was due to higher property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances. \nInterest Expense\n \n-\n the variance is due primarily to the following:\n•\nThe increase at CL&P was due to higher interest on long-term debt as a result of debt issuances ($26.0 million), an increase in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($5.8 million), higher interest on short-term notes payable due to increased borrowings ($4.6 million) and higher amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($0.9 million), partially offset by an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to debt funds ($0.4 million).\n•\nThe\n \nincrease at NSTAR Electric was due to higher interest on long-term debt as a result of debt issuances ($23.2 million), an increase in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($11.8 million), higher interest on short-term notes payable due to increased borrowings ($7.8 million) and higher amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($0.6 million), partially offset by an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to debt funds ($10.0 million).\n•\nThe increase at PSNH was due primarily to higher interest on long-term debt as a result of a debt issuance ($14.8 million), partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($4.3 million), an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to debt funds ($2.8 million), a decrease in RRB interest expense ($1.4 million), lower interest on short-term notes payable ($0.8 million) and lower amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($0.6 million).\nOther Income, Net\n \n- \nthe variance is due primarily to the following:\n•\nThe increase at CL&P was due primarily to an increase in interest income primarily on regulatory deferrals ($19.3 million), an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to equity funds ($2.4 million) and a decrease in investment losses driven by market volatility ($1.0 million), partially offset by a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($6.7 million). \n•\nThe increase at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to an increase in interest income primarily on regulatory deferrals ($16.4 million), an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to equity funds ($13.1 million) and investment income in 2024 compared to investment losses in 2023 driven by market volatility ($2.1 million), partially offset by a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($4.6 million).\n•\nThe increase at PSNH was due primarily to an increase in interest income primarily on regulatory deferrals ($4.3 million), an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to equity funds ($1.6 million) and a decrease in investment losses driven by market volatility ($0.2 million), partially offset by a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($1.3 million).\nIncome Tax Expense\n \n-\n the variance is due primarily to the following:\n•\nThe increase at CL&P was due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($3.7 million), a decrease in amortization of EDIT ($1.3 million), an increase in valuation allowances ($8.8 million), higher share-based payment tax deficiency ($0.6 million), and an increase in items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($10.6 million), partially offset by lower state taxes ($0.2 million), and lower return to provision adjustments ($1.2 million).\n•\nThe increase at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($27.3 million), higher state taxes ($7.4 million), higher share-based payment tax deficiency ($0.6 million), and a decrease in amortization of EDIT ($8.4 million), partially offset by lower return to provision adjustments ($1.4 million) and a decrease in items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($4.7 million).\n•\nThe increase at PSNH was due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($6.4 million), a decrease in amortization of EDIT ($0.3 million), higher state taxes ($1.5 million), and higher return to provision adjustments ($3.0 million).\n57\nEARNINGS SUMMARY\nCL&P's earnings decreased $6.1 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to higher interest expense, a higher effective tax rate, higher depreciation expense, higher operations and maintenance expense, and higher property tax expense.  The earnings decrease was partially offset by higher revenues from its capital tracking mechanism due to increased electric system improvements, an increase in transmission earnings driven primarily by a higher transmission rate base, and an increase in interest income primarily on regulatory deferrals. \nNSTAR Electric's earnings increased $91.9 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to higher revenues as a result of the base distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2024, an increase in transmission earnings driven primarily by a higher transmission rate base, an increase in interest income primarily on regulatory deferrals, higher revenues from its capital tracking mechanisms due to increased investments, a lower effective tax rate, and higher AFUDC equity income.  The earnings increase was partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense, higher interest expense, higher property tax expense, and higher depreciation expense.  \nPSNH's earnings increased $19.2 million in 2024, as compared to 2023, due primarily to higher revenues as a result of the base distribution rate increase effective August 1, 2024 and an increase in transmission earnings driven primarily by a higher transmission rate base.  The earnings increase was partially offset by the absence of a prior year benefit related to the establishment of a new regulatory tracking mechanism that allowed for the recovery of previously incurred operating expenses associated with poles acquired on May 1, 2023, higher operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense, and a higher effective tax rate.\nLIQUIDITY\nCash Flows:  \nCL&P had cash flows provided by operating activities of $683.4 million in 2024, as compared to $449.6 million in 2023.  The increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to an improvement in regulatory recoveries driven primarily by the timing of collections for the non-bypassable FMCC and other regulatory tracking mechanisms partially offset by the unfavorable impact in the timing of collections for energy supply costs, the timing of cash payments made on our accounts payable, a $19.9 million decrease in cost of removal expenditures, an $18.9 million decrease in cash payments to vendors for storm costs, and a $3.3 million increase in income tax refunds received in 2024 compared to 2023.  The impacts of regulatory collections are included in both Regulatory Recoveries and Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities) on the statements of cash flows.  These favorable impacts were partially offset by the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable and the timing of other working capital items.\nNSTAR Electric had cash flows provided by operating activities of $687.6 million in 2024, as compared to $713.6 million in 2023.  The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable, an $87.4 million increase in income tax payments made, an increase in regulatory under-recoveries driven by the timing of collections for energy efficiency, residential assistance and other regulatory tracking mechanisms partially offset by the favorable impact in the timing of collections for net metering costs, and the timing of cash payments made on our accounts payable.  The impacts of regulatory collections are included in both Regulatory Recoveries and Amortization of Regulatory Assets on the statements of cash flows.  These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a $9.1 million decrease in cost of removal expenditures and the timing of other working capital items.\nPSNH had cash flows provided by operating activities of $321.3 million in 2024, as compared to $32.0 million in 2023.  The increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to an improvement in regulatory recoveries driven by the timing of collections for stranded costs, net metering and other regulatory tracking mechanisms, the timing of cash payments made on our accounts payable, and the timing of other working capital items.  The impacts of regulatory collections are included in both Regulatory Recoveries and Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities) on the statements of cash flows.  These favorable impacts were partially offset by the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable, a $23.9 million decrease in income tax refunds received in 2024 compared to 2023, a $5.6 million increase in cash payments to vendors for storm costs, and a $2.5 million increase in cost of removal expenditures.\nFor further information on CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's and PSNH's liquidity and capital resources, see \"Liquidity\" and \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures\" included in this \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\n58\nItem 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarket Risk Information\nCommodity Price Risk Management:\n  Our regulated companies enter into energy contracts to serve our customers, and the economic impacts of those contracts are passed on to our customers.  Accordingly, the regulated companies have no exposure to loss of future earnings or fair values due to these market risk-sensitive instruments.  Eversource's Energy Supply Risk Committee, comprised of senior officers, reviews and approves all large-scale energy related transactions entered into by its regulated companies.\nOther Risk Management Activities\nWe have an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program for identifying the principal risks of the Company.  Our ERM program involves the application of a well-defined, enterprise-wide methodology designed to allow our Risk Committee, comprised of our senior officers of the Company, to identify, categorize, prioritize, and mitigate the principal risks to the Company.  The ERM program is integrated with other assurance functions throughout the Company including Compliance, Auditing, and Insurance to ensure appropriate coverage of risks that could impact the Company.  In addition to known risks, ERM identifies emerging risks to the Company, through participation in industry groups, discussions with management and in consultation with outside advisers.  Our management then analyzes risks to determine materiality, likelihood and impact, and develops mitigation strategies.  Management broadly considers our business model, the utility industry, the global economy, climate change, sustainability and the current environment to identify risks.  The Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees is responsible for oversight of the Company's ERM program and enterprise-wide risks as well as specific risks associated with insurance, credit, financing, investments, pensions and overall system security including cyber security.  The findings of the ERM process are periodically discussed with the Finance Committee of our Board of Trustees, as well as with other Board Committees or the full Board of Trustees, as appropriate, including reporting on how these issues are being measured and managed.  However, there can be no assurances that the ERM process will identify or manage every risk or event that could impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nInterest Rate Risk Management:\n  Interest rate risk is associated with changes in interest rates for our outstanding long-term debt.  Our interest rate risk is significantly reduced as typically all or most of our debt financings have fixed interest rates.  As of December 31, 2024, all of our long-term debt was at a fixed interest rate.   \nCredit Risk Management:\n  Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of non-performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of our contractual obligations.  We serve a wide variety of customers and transact with suppliers that include IPPs, industrial companies, natural gas and electric utilities, oil and natural gas producers, financial institutions, and other energy marketers.  Margin accounts exist within this diverse group, and we realize interest receipts and payments related to balances outstanding in these margin accounts.  This wide customer and supplier mix generates a need for a variety of contractual structures, products and terms that, in turn, require us to manage the portfolio of market risk inherent in those transactions in a manner consistent with the parameters established by our risk management process.\nOur regulated companies are subject to credit risk from certain long-term or high-volume supply contracts with energy marketing companies.  Our regulated companies manage the credit risk with these counterparties in accordance with established credit risk practices and monitor contracting risks, including credit risk.  As of December 31, 2024, our regulated companies held collateral (letters of credit or cash) of $15 million from counterparties related to our standard service contracts.  As of December 31, 2024, Eversource had $21.4 million of cash posted with ISO-NE related to energy transactions.  \nIf the respective unsecured debt ratings of Eversource or its subsidiaries were reduced to below investment grade by either Moody's, S&P or Fitch, certain of Eversource's contracts would require additional collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit to be provided to counterparties and independent system operators.  Eversource would have been and remains able to provide that collateral.  \n59\nItem 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nEversource\n \nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\n \nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No. \n34\n)\n \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n \n \nCL&P\n \nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\n \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No. \n34\n)\n \nFinancial Statements\n \n \nNSTAR Electric\n \nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\n \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No. \n34\n)\n \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n \n \nPSNH\n \nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\n \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No. \n34\n)\n \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n \n \n60\nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nEversource Energy\nManagement is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Eversource Energy and subsidiaries (Eversource or the Company) and of other sections of this annual report.  Eversource's internal controls over financial reporting were audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting.  The Company's internal control framework and processes have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  There are inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting that could allow material misstatements due to error or fraud to occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees during the normal course of business.  Additionally, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate in the future due to changes in the business environment.  \nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, Eversource conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on this evaluation under the framework in COSO, management concluded that internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2024.\nFebruary 14, 2025 \n61\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Eversource Energy:\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Eversource Energy and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 14, 2025 \n62\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Eversource Energy:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eversource Energy and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 of Part IV (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. \nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRegulatory Accounting - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to regulation by federal, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire utility regulatory agencies (the “Commissions”), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of the Company’s electric, natural gas, and water distribution companies.  Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  As discussed in Note 2, regulatory proceedings in recent years have focused on the recoverability of costs, including storm costs, regulatory tracking mechanisms and benefit costs, amongst others.  In some cases, the Company records regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission.  As a result, assessing the potential outcomes of future regulatory orders requires management judgment.\n \nWe identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs.  Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n•      We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets.\n63\n•      We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the applicability and impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments disclosed in the financial statements.\n•      We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.  We also evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•      For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions\n.\n•      We performed audit procedures on deferred storm restoration costs for completeness and accuracy.\n•      We made inquiries of management, including legal counsel, and obtained the regulatory orders and analysis from management that support the probability of recovery in rates for regulatory assets to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Affiliates – Impact of Offshore Wind Investment Divestiture - Refer to Note 6 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Eversource sold its interests in the Revolution Wind project, the South Fork Wind project, and the Sunrise Wind project. Eversource’s offshore wind business continues to hold a noncontrolling tax equity investment in the South Fork Wind project through a 100 percent ownership in the Class A shares of South Fork Wind Holdings, LLC.\nUpon sale, Eversource recorded a loss of approximately $524 million.  As part of the sale, Eversource agreed to make certain post-closing purchase price adjustment payments, which could further impact the final purchase price.  The Company recorded a liability of $365 million reflecting its estimate of the future obligations under the sale terms, which primarily include a cost overrun sharing obligation, an expected obligation to maintain the buyer’s internal rate of return and obligations for other future costs.\nWe identified the evaluation of the offshore wind investment divestiture as a critical audit matter because of the extensive effort required to audit the subjective and complex judgments associated with the determination of the loss on sale and related contingent liability.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the offshore wind investment divestiture included the following, among others:\n•    We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over loss considerations including the recording and disclosure of the loss on the offshore wind investments, including estimates and assumptions used to measure the loss.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Accounting - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to regulation by federal and Connecticut utility regulatory agencies (the “Commissions”), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of the Company’s electric distribution business.  Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  As discussed in Note 2, regulatory proceedings in recent years have focused on the recoverability of costs, including storm costs, regulatory tracking mechanisms and benefit costs, amongst others.  In some cases, the Company records regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission.  As a result, assessing the potential outcomes of future regulatory orders requires management judgment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs.  Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n•      We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets.\n70\n•      We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the applicability and impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments disclosed in the financial statements.\n•      We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.  We also evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•      For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions\n.\n•      We performed audit procedures on deferred storm restoration costs for completeness and accuracy.\n•      We made inquiries of management, including legal counsel, and obtained the regulatory orders and analysis from management that support the probability of recovery in rates for regulatory assets to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery.\n/s/

Electric Company\nManagement is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of NSTAR Electric Company and subsidiary (NSTAR Electric or the Company) and of other sections of this annual report.  \nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting.  The Company's internal control framework and processes have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  There are inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting that could allow material misstatements due to error or fraud to occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees during the normal course of business.  Additionally, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate in the future due to changes in the business environment.  \nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, NSTAR Electric conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on this evaluation under the framework in COSO, management concluded that internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2024.\nFebruary 14, 2025 \n76\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholder of NSTAR Electric Company:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NSTAR Electric Company and subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 of Part IV (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Accounting - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to regulation by federal and Massachusetts utility regulatory agencies (the “Commissions”), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of the Company’s electric distribution business.  Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  As discussed in Note 2, regulatory proceedings in recent years have focused on the recoverability of costs.  In some cases, the Company records regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission.  As a result, assessing the potential outcomes of future regulatory orders requires management judgment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs.  Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n•      We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets.\n77\n•      We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the applicability and impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments disclosed in the financial statements.\n•      We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.  We also evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•      For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions\n.\n•      We made inquiries of management, including legal counsel, and obtained the regulatory orders and analysis from management that support the probability of recovery in rates for regulatory assets to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery.\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n \nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 14, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s

the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Public Service Company of New Hampshire and subsidiaries (PSNH or the Company) and of other sections of this annual report.  \nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting.  The Company's internal control framework and processes have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  There are inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting that could allow material misstatements due to error or fraud to occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees during the normal course of business.  Additionally, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate in the future due to changes in the business environment.  \nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, PSNH conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on this evaluation under the framework in COSO, management concluded that internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2024.\nFebruary 14, 2025 \n83\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholder of Public Service Company of New Hampshire:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Public Service Company of New Hampshire and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 of Part IV (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Accounting - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to regulation by federal and New Hampshire utility regulatory agencies (the “Commissions”), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of the Company’s electric distribution business.  Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  As discussed in Note 2, regulatory proceedings in recent years have focused on the recoverability of costs.  In some cases, the Company records regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission.  As a result, assessing the potential outcomes of future regulatory orders requires management judgment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs.  Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n•      We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets.\n84\n•      We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the applicability and impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments disclosed in the financial statements.\n•      We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.  We also evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•      For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions\n.\n•      We made inquiries of management, including legal counsel, and obtained the regulatory orders and analysis from management that support the probability of recovery in rates for regulatory assets to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery.\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n \nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 14, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\n85\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n \nAs of December 31,\n(Thousands of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\nASSETS\n \n \nCurrent

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRefer to the Glossary of Terms included in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for abbreviations and acronyms used throughout the combined notes to the financial statements.\n1.     \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nA.     About Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH\nEversource Energy is a public utility holding company primarily engaged, through its wholly-owned regulated utility subsidiaries, in the energy delivery business.  Eversource Energy's wholly-owned regulated utility subsidiaries consist of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH (electric utilities), Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and EGMA (natural gas utilities), and Aquarion (water utilities).  Eversource provides energy delivery and/or water service to approximately \n4.6\n million electric, natural gas and water customers through \ntwelve\n regulated utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Eversource Energy is a public utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.  Arrangements among the regulated electric companies and other Eversource companies, outside agencies and other utilities covering interconnections, interchange of electric power and sales of utility property are subject to regulation by the FERC.  Eversource's regulated companies are subject to regulation of rates, accounting and other matters by the FERC and/or applicable state regulatory commissions (the PURA for CL&P, Yankee Gas and Aquarion, the DPU for NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Aquarion, and the NHPUC for PSNH and Aquarion).\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH furnish franchised retail electric service in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively.  NSTAR Gas and EGMA are engaged in the distribution and sale of natural gas to customers within Massachusetts and Yankee Gas is engaged in the distribution and sale of natural gas to customers within Connecticut.  Aquarion is engaged in the collection, treatment and distribution of water in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH's results include the operations of their respective distribution and transmission businesses.  The distribution business also includes the results of NSTAR Electric's solar power facilities.\nEversource Service, Eversource's service company, and several wholly-owned real estate subsidiaries of Eversource, provide support services to Eversource, including its regulated companies.   \nB.     \nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Eversource, NSTAR Electric and PSNH include the accounts of each of their respective subsidiaries.   Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Eversource, NSTAR Electric and PSNH and the financial statements of CL&P are herein collectively referred to as the \"financial statements.\"  \nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCYAPC and YAEC are inactive regional nuclear power companies engaged in the long-term storage of their spent nuclear fuel.  Eversource consolidates the operations of CYAPC and YAEC because CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's and PSNH's combined ownership and voting interests in each of these entities is greater than 50 percent.  Intercompany transactions between CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and the CYAPC and YAEC companies have been eliminated in consolidation of the Eversource financial statements.  \nEversource holds equity ownership interests that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method.  In the third quarter of 2024, Eversource sold its \n50\n percent equity ownership interests in \nthree\n offshore wind projects that had been accounted for under the equity method.  See Note 6, “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates,” for further information.\nIn accordance with accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, the Preferred Stock of CL&P and the Preferred Stock of NSTAR Electric, which are not owned by Eversource or its consolidated subsidiaries and are not subject to mandatory redemption, have been presented as noncontrolling interests in the financial statements of Eversource.  The Preferred Stock of CL&P and the Preferred Stock of NSTAR Electric are considered to be temporary equity and have been classified between liabilities and permanent shareholders' equity on the balance sheets of Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric due to a provision in the preferred stock agreements of both CL&P and NSTAR Electric that grant preferred stockholders the right to elect a majority of the CL&P and NSTAR Electric Boards of Directors, respectively, should certain conditions exist, such as if preferred dividends are in arrears for a specified amount of time.  The Net Income reported in the statements of income and cash flows represents net income prior to apportionment to noncontrolling interests, which is represented by dividends on preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric.\n90\nEversource's utility subsidiaries' electric, natural gas and water distribution and transmission businesses are subject to rate-regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for entities with rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the differences in the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses from those of other businesses and industries.  See Note 2, \"Regulatory Accounting,\" for further information.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Eversource's carrying amount of goodwill was $\n3.57\n billion and $\n4.53\n billion, respectively.  Eversource performs an assessment for possible impairment of its goodwill at least annually.  Eversource completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment for each of its reporting units as of October 1, 2024, and performed an interim goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2024. Eversource recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n297\n million in 2024 as a result of the likely sale of Aquarion at a loss.  See Note 25, \"Goodwill,\" for further information.  The assets and liabilities of the Aquarion water distribution business, including remaining goodwill of $\n662.5\n million, met the criteria to be classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024.  Unless otherwise specified, the amounts and information in the notes presented do not include assets and liabilities that have been reclassified as held for sale.  See Note 24, \"Assets Held for Sale,\" for further information.\nCertain reclassifications of prior year data were made in the accompanying financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.\nC.     \nAccounting Standards\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted:  \nOn January 1, 2025, the Company retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n, which requires entities to disclose significant segment expenses, other segment items, and the title and position of the chief operating decision maker (CODM). Additionally, the ASU requires entities to disclose how the CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources, among certain other required disclosures.  Furthermore, current annual disclosures will be required in interim periods.  The modified disclosures are included in Note 23, “Segment Information.”\nD.     \nCash\nCash includes cash on hand.  At the end of each reporting period, any overdraft amounts are reclassified from Cash to Accounts Payable on the balance sheets.\nE.     \nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nReceivables, Net on the balance sheets primarily includes trade receivables from retail customers and customers related to wholesale transmission contracts, wholesale market sales, sales of RECs, and property rentals.  Receivables, Net also includes customer receivables for the purchase of electricity from a competitive third party supplier, the current portion of customer energy efficiency loans, property damage receivables and other miscellaneous receivables.  There is no material concentration of receivables.  \nReceivables are recorded at amortized cost, net of a credit loss provision (or allowance for uncollectible accounts).  The current expected credit loss (CECL) model is applied to receivables for purposes of calculating the allowance for uncollectible accounts.  This model is based on expected losses and results in the recognition of estimated expected credit losses, including uncollectible amounts for both billed and unbilled revenues, over the life of the receivable at the time a receivable is recorded.\nThe allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined based upon a variety of judgments and factors, including an aging-based quantitative assessment that applies an estimated uncollectible percentage to each receivable aging category.  Factors in determining credit loss include historical collection, write-off experience, analysis of delinquency statistics, and management's assessment of collectability from customers, including current economic conditions, customer payment trends, the impact on customer bills because of energy usage trends and changes in rates, flexible payment plans and financial hardship arrearage management programs offered to customers, reasonable forecasts, and expectations of future collectability and collection efforts.  Management continuously assesses the collectability of receivables and adjusts estimates based on actual experience and future expectations based on economic conditions, collection efforts and other factors.  Management also monitors the aging analysis of receivables to determine if there are changes in the collections of accounts receivable.  Receivable balances are written off against the allowance for uncollectible accounts when the customer accounts are no longer in service and these balances are deemed to be uncollectible.  Management concluded that the reserve balance as of December 31, 2024 adequately reflected the collection risk and net realizable value for its receivables.\nThe PURA allows CL&P and Yankee Gas to accelerate the recovery of accounts receivable balances attributable to qualified customers under financial or medical duress (uncollectible hardship accounts receivable) outstanding for greater than \n180\n days and \n90\n days, respectively.  The DPU allows NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and EGMA to recover in rates amounts associated with certain uncollectible hardship accounts receivable.  These uncollectible hardship customer account balances are included in Regulatory Assets or Other Long-Term Assets on the balance sheets.  Hardship customers are protected from shut-off in certain circumstances, and historical collection experience has reflected a higher default risk as compared to the rest of the receivable population.  Management uses a higher credit risk profile for this pool of trade receivables as compared to non-hardship receivables.  The allowance for uncollectible hardship accounts is included in the total uncollectible allowance balance.\n  \n91\nThe total allowance for uncollectible accounts is included in Receivables, Net on the balance sheets.  \nThe activity in the allowance for uncollectible accounts by portfolio segment is as follows:\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\n(Millions of Dollars)\nHardship Accounts\nRetail (Non-Hardship), \nWholesale, and Other\nTotal Allowance\nHardship Accounts\nRetail (Non-Hardship), \nWholesale, and Other\nTotal Allowance\nHardship Accounts\nRetail (Non-Hardship), \nWholesale, and Other\nTotal Allowance\nTotal Allowance \n(3)\nBalance as of January 1, 2022\n$\n226.1\n \n$\n191.3\n \n$\n417.4\n \n$\n144.6\n \n$\n36.7\n \n$\n181.3\n \n$\n43.3\n \n$\n53.7\n \n$\n97.0\n \n$\n24.3\n \nUncollectible Expense\n—\n \n61.9\n \n61.9\n \n—\n \n15.6\n \n15.6\n \n—\n \n21.6\n \n21.6\n \n9.2\n \nUncollectible Costs Deferred \n(1)\n77.8\n \n34.7\n \n112.5\n \n58.3\n \n1.2\n \n59.5\n \n1.5\n \n10.9\n \n12.4\n \n2.5\n \nWrite-Offs\n(\n21.3\n)\n(\n102.7\n)\n(\n124.0\n)\n(\n15.3\n)\n(\n23.0\n)\n(\n38.3\n)\n(\n1.1\n)\n(\n41.2\n)\n(\n42.3\n)\n(\n7.7\n)\nRecoveries Collected\n1.8\n \n16.7\n \n18.5\n \n1.3\n \n5.9\n \n7.2\n \n—\n \n6.3\n \n6.3\n \n0.9\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n284.4\n \n$\n201.9\n \n$\n486.3\n \n$\n188.9\n \n$\n36.4\n \n$\n225.3\n \n$\n43.7\n \n$\n51.3\n \n$\n95.0\n \n$\n29.2\n \nUncollectible Expense\n—\n \n72.5\n \n72.5\n \n—\n \n11.7\n \n11.7\n \n—\n \n22.8\n \n22.8\n \n4.0\n \nUncollectible Costs Deferred \n(1)\n137.0\n \n21.2\n \n158.2\n \n114.4\n \n12.0\n \n126.4\n \n1.5\n \n16.0\n \n17.5\n \n(\n8.7\n)\nWrite-Offs\n(\n55.9\n)\n(\n122.2\n)\n(\n178.1\n)\n(\n44.7\n)\n(\n28.5\n)\n(\n73.2\n)\n(\n1.6\n)\n(\n41.7\n)\n(\n43.3\n)\n(\n10.9\n)\nRecoveries Collected\n1.3\n \n14.3\n \n15.6\n \n1.1\n \n4.7\n \n5.8\n \n—\n \n5.0\n \n5.0\n \n0.7\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n366.8\n \n$\n187.7\n \n$\n554.5\n \n$\n259.7\n \n$\n36.3\n \n$\n296.0\n \n$\n43.6\n \n$\n53.4\n \n$\n97.0\n \n$\n14.3\n \nUncollectible Expense\n—\n \n74.1\n \n74.1\n \n—\n \n17.2\n \n17.2\n \n—\n \n33.6\n \n33.6\n \n4.7\n \nUncollectible Costs Deferred \n(1)\n71.4\n \n48.3\n \n119.7\n \n35.5\n \n11.3\n \n46.8\n \n16.2\n \n21.5\n \n37.7\n \n5.1\n \nWrite-Offs\n(\n74.3\n)\n(\n129.5\n)\n(\n203.8\n)\n(\n55.1\n)\n(\n30.9\n)\n(\n86.0\n)\n(\n4.6\n)\n(\n52.4\n)\n(\n57.0\n)\n(\n10.9\n)\nRecoveries Collected\n0.7\n \n13.3\n \n14.0\n \n0.6\n \n4.5\n \n5.1\n \n—\n \n3.6\n \n3.6\n \n0.9\n \nDecrease due to Assets Held\n   for Sale \n(2)\n—\n \n(\n2.3\n)\n(\n2.3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n364.6\n \n$\n191.6\n \n$\n556.2\n \n$\n240.7\n \n$\n38.4\n \n$\n279.1\n \n$\n55.2\n \n$\n59.7\n \n$\n114.9\n \n$\n14.1\n \n(1)    \nThese expected credit losses are deferred as regulatory costs on the balance sheets, as these amounts are ultimately recovered in rates.

As of December 31, 2023, this balance was recorded within Receivables, Net on the Eversource balance sheet.  For further information, see Note 24, “Assets Held for Sale.”\n(3)    \nIn connection with PSNH’s pole purchase agreement on May 1, 2023, the purchase price included the forgiveness of previously reserved receivables for reimbursement of operation and maintenance and vegetation management costs.\nF.    \nTransfer of Energy Efficiency Loans\nCL&P transferred a portion of its energy efficiency customer loan portfolio to outside lenders in order to make additional loans to customers.  CL&P remains the servicer of the loans and will transmit customer payments to the lenders, with a maximum amount outstanding under this program of $\n70\n million.  The amounts of the loans are included in Receivables, Net and Other Long-Term Assets, and are offset by Other Current Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities on CL&P’s balance sheet.\n The current and long-term portions totaled $\n9.4\n million and $\n17.3\n million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, and $\n8.5\n million and $\n14.5\n million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. \nG.     \nMaterials, Supplies, Natural Gas and REC Inventory\nMaterials, Supplies, Natural Gas and REC Inventory include materials and supplies purchased primarily for construction or operation and maintenance purposes, natural gas purchased for delivery to customers, and RECs.  Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  RECs are purchased from suppliers of renewable sources of generation and are used to meet state mandated Renewable Portfolio Standards requirements.\n  \nThe carrying amounts of materials and supplies, natural gas inventory, and RECs, which are included in Current Assets on the balance sheets, were as follows:\n \nAs of December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(Millions of Dollars)\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nMaterials and Supplies\n$\n498.6\n \n$\n217.3\n \n$\n177.8\n \n$\n72.1\n \n$\n397.9\n \n$\n156.2\n \n$\n130.8\n \n$\n76.5\n \nNatural Gas \n49.5\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n65.5\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nRECs\n46.5\n \n—\n \n42.8\n \n3.7\n \n43.9\n \n0.3\n \n43.0\n \n0.6\n \nTotal\n$\n594.6\n \n$\n217.3\n \n$\n220.6\n \n$\n75.8\n \n$\n507.3\n \n$\n156.5\n \n$\n173.8\n \n$\n77.1\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the materials and supplies attributable to the Aquarion water distribution business have been reclassified to Assets Held for Sale on the Eversource balance sheet.

For further information, see Note 24, “Assets Held for Sale.”\n92\nH.\n     \nFair Value Measurements\nFair value measurement guidance is applied to derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as \"normal purchases\" or \"normal sales\" (normal) and to marketable securities held in trusts.  Fair value measurement guidance is also applied to valuations of the investments used to calculate the funded status of pension and PBOP plans, the nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets such as goodwill, long-lived assets, equity method investments, AROs, and in the valuation of business combinations and asset acquisitions.  The fair value measurement guidance was also applied in estimating the fair value of preferred stock, long-term debt and RRBs. \nFair Value Hierarchy:\n  In measuring fair value, Eversource uses observable market data when available in order to minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  Inputs used in fair value measurements are categorized into three fair value hierarchy levels for disclosure purposes.  The entire fair value measurement is categorized based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Eversource evaluates the classification of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a quarterly basis.  \nThe levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1 - Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.  Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  \nLevel 2 - Inputs are quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable.\nLevel 3 - Quoted market prices are not available.  Fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or assumptions are unobservable.  Where possible, valuation techniques incorporate observable market inputs that can be validated to external sources such as industry exchanges, including prices of energy and energy-related products.  \nUncategorized - Investments that are measured at net asset value are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. \nDetermination of Fair Value:\n  The valuation techniques and inputs used in Eversource's fair value measurements are described in Note 4, \"Derivative Instruments,\" Note 5, \"Marketable Securities,\" Note 6, \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates,\" Note 7, \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" Note 11A, \"Employee Benefits – Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension,\"\n \nNote 15, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" and Note 25, “Goodwill,” to the financial statements.\nI.     \nDerivative Accounting\nMany of the electric and natural gas companies' contracts for the purchase and sale of energy or energy-related products are derivatives.  The accounting treatment for energy contracts entered into varies and depends on the intended use of the particular contract and on whether or not the contract is a derivative.  \nThe application of derivative accounting is complex and requires management judgment in the following respects: identification of derivatives and embedded derivatives, election and designation of a contract as normal, and determination of the fair value of derivative contracts.  All of these judgments can have a significant impact on the financial statements.  The judgment applied in the election of a contract as normal (and resulting accrual accounting) includes the conclusion that it is probable at the inception of the contract and throughout its term that it will result in physical delivery of the underlying product and that the quantities will be used or sold by the business in the normal course of business.  If facts and circumstances change and management can no longer support this conclusion, then a contract cannot be considered normal, accrual accounting is terminated, and fair value accounting is applied prospectively.  \nThe fair value of derivative contracts is based upon the contract terms and conditions and the underlying market price or fair value per unit.  When quantities are not specified in the contract, the Company determines whether the contract has a determinable quantity by using amounts referenced in default provisions and other relevant sections of the contract.  The fair value of derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are offset and recorded as a net derivative asset or liability on the balance sheets.  \nRegulatory assets or regulatory liabilities are recorded to offset the fair values of these derivative contracts related to energy and energy-related products, as contract settlements are recovered from, or refunded to, customers in future rates.  All changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities and do not impact net income.\nFor further information regarding derivative contracts, see Note 4, \"Derivative Instruments,\" to the financial statements.\nJ.     Operating Expenses\nThe cost of natural gas included in Purchased Power, Purchased Natural Gas and Transmission on the statements of income was as follows:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEversource - Cost of Natural Gas\n$\n689.6\n \n$\n792.2\n \n$\n1,010.2\n \n93\nK.\n     \nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction\nAFUDC represents the cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction and is included in the cost of the electric, natural gas and water companies' utility plant on the balance sheet.  The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is recorded as a reduction of Interest Expense, and the AFUDC related to equity funds is recorded as Other Income, Net on the statements of income.  AFUDC costs are recovered from customers over the service life of the related plant in the form of increased revenue collected as a result of higher depreciation expense. \nThe average AFUDC rate is based on a FERC-prescribed formula using the cost of a company's short-term financings and capitalization (preferred stock, long-term debt and common equity), as appropriate.  The average rate is applied to average eligible CWIP amounts to calculate AFUDC.\n \nAFUDC costs and the weighted-average AFUDC rates were as follows:\nEversource\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars, except percentages)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBorrowed Funds\n$\n64.4\n \n$\n44.6\n \n$\n21.8\n \nEquity Funds\n97.8\n \n78.1\n \n47.3\n \nTotal AFUDC\n$\n162.2\n \n$\n122.7\n \n$\n69.1\n \nAverage AFUDC Rate\n6.5\n \n%\n5.8\n \n%\n4.7\n \n%\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Millions of Dollars,\nexcept percentages)\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nBorrowed Funds\n$\n8.1\n \n$\n27.2\n \n$\n8.9\n \n$\n7.7\n \n$\n17.2\n \n$\n6.1\n \n$\n4.8\n \n$\n10.7\n \n$\n1.4\n \nEquity Funds\n22.4\n \n58.8\n \n7.0\n \n20.0\n \n45.7\n \n5.4\n \n13.6\n \n24.6\n \n2.5\n \nTotal AFUDC\n$\n30.5\n \n$\n86.0\n \n$\n15.9\n \n$\n27.7\n \n$\n62.9\n \n$\n11.5\n \n$\n18.4\n \n$\n35.3\n \n$\n3.9\n \nAverage AFUDC Rate\n6.7\n \n%\n7.0\n \n%\n5.5\n \n%\n6.7\n \n%\n5.9\n \n%\n5.1\n \n%\n6.6\n \n%\n5.4\n \n%\n2.6\n \n%\n \nL.     Other Income, Net\nThe components of Other Income, Net on the statements of income were as follows:\nEversource\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPension, SERP and PBOP Non-Service Income Components, \n  Net of Deferred Portion \n(1)\n$\n115.4\n \n$\n132.9\n \n$\n219.8\n \nAFUDC Equity\n97.8\n \n78.1\n \n47.3\n \nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates \n(2)\n51.9\n \n15.5\n \n22.9\n \nInvestment Income/(Loss)\n0.6\n \n(\n4.9\n)\n1.9\n \nInterest Income\n138.2\n \n94.2\n \n50.5\n \nOther \n(2)\n6.6\n \n32.3\n \n3.7\n \nTotal Other Income, Net\n$\n410.5\n \n$\n348.1\n \n$\n346.1\n \n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nPension, SERP and PBOP Non-Service Income Components, Net of Deferred Portion \n(1)\n$\n28.2\n \n$\n52.8\n \n$\n14.9\n \n$\n34.9\n \n$\n57.4\n \n$\n16.2\n \n$\n64.4\n \n$\n85.5\n \n$\n26.8\n \nAFUDC Equity\n22.4\n \n58.8\n \n7.0\n \n20.0\n \n45.7\n \n5.4\n \n13.6\n \n24.6\n \n2.5\n \nInvestment (Loss)/Income\n(\n1.4\n)\n1.9\n \n(\n0.5\n)\n(\n2.4\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\n(\n0.7\n)\n(\n1.3\n)\n1.2\n \n0.2\n \nInterest Income\n28.3\n \n77.0\n \n9.6\n \n9.0\n \n60.6\n \n5.3\n \n6.5\n \n30.7\n \n3.1\n \nOther\n0.1\n \n0.9\n \n0.1\n \n0.1\n \n0.6\n \n0.4\n \n0.1\n \n0.7\n \n0.1\n \nTotal Other Income, Net\n$\n77.6\n \n$\n191.4\n \n$\n31.1\n \n$\n61.6\n \n$\n164.1\n \n$\n26.6\n \n$\n83.3\n \n$\n142.7\n \n$\n32.7\n \n(1)\n    See Note 11A, \"Employee Benefits – Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension,\" for the components of net periodic benefit income/expense for the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans.

In the third quarter of 2024, Eversource sold its equity method investments in \nthree\n offshore wind projects.  In March 2023, Eversource’s equity method investment in a renewable energy fund was liquidated.  Liquidation proceeds in excess of the carrying value were recorded in 2023 within Other in the table above.

Eversource did \nnot\n make any contributions in 2024.\n2.     \nREGULATORY ACCOUNTING\nEversource's utility companies are subject to rate regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses.  The regulated companies' financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making process.  The rates charged to the customers of Eversource's regulated companies are designed to collect each company's costs to provide service, plus a return on investment.  \nThe application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities.  Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates.  Regulatory liabilities represent either revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.\nManagement believes it is probable that each of the regulated companies will recover its respective investments in long-lived assets and the regulatory assets that have been recorded.  If management were to determine that it could no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises, or if management could not conclude it is probable that costs would be recovered from customers in future rates, the applicable costs would be charged to net income in the period in which the determination is made.\nRegulatory Assets:  \nThe components of regulatory assets were as follows:\n \nAs of December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(Millions of Dollars)\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nStorm Costs, Net\n$\n2,039.4\n \n$\n971.1\n \n$\n609.8\n \n$\n458.5\n \n$\n1,785.9\n \n$\n896.6\n \n$\n609.1\n \n$\n280.2\n \nRegulatory Tracking Mechanisms\n1,781.6\n \n507.7\n \n650.0\n \n162.8\n \n1,319.2\n \n354.5\n \n482.9\n \n182.2\n \nBenefit Costs\n967.4\n \n168.8\n \n293.6\n \n65.6\n \n1,117.3\n \n197.4\n \n336.7\n \n79.3\n \nIncome Taxes, Net\n968.4\n \n521.0\n \n145.4\n \n20.7\n \n912.4\n \n512.6\n \n128.6\n \n16.4\n \nSecuritized Stranded Costs\n349.3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n349.3\n \n392.5\n \n—\n \n—\n \n392.5\n \nGoodwill-related\n247.2\n \n—\n \n212.3\n \n—\n \n264.1\n \n—\n \n226.7\n \n—\n \nAsset Retirement Obligations\n150.2\n \n41.2\n \n78.3\n \n5.1\n \n137.9\n \n38.5\n \n72.3\n \n4.7\n \nDerivative Liabilities\n57.2\n \n57.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n120.9\n \n120.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \nOther Regulatory Assets\n510.0\n \n58.5\n \n117.7\n \n3.7\n \n339.0\n \n22.7\n \n101.6\n \n8.0\n \nTotal Regulatory Assets\n7,070.7\n \n2,325.5\n \n2,107.1\n \n1,065.7\n \n6,389.2\n \n2,143.2\n \n1,957.9\n \n963.3\n \nLess:  Current Portion\n2,189.7\n \n638.5\n \n902.8\n \n173.3\n \n1,674.2\n \n480.4\n \n676.1\n \n189.5\n \nTotal Long-Term Regulatory Assets\n$\n4,881.0\n \n$\n1,687.0\n \n$\n1,204.3\n \n$\n892.4\n \n$\n4,715.0\n \n$\n1,662.8\n \n$\n1,281.8\n \n$\n773.8\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Regulatory Assets attributable to the Aquarion water distribution business have been reclassified to Assets Held for Sale on the Eversource balance sheet.  As of December 31, 2023, these balances were recorded within Regulatory Assets on the Eversource balance sheet.  For further information, see Note 24, “Assets Held for Sale.”\n96\nStorm Costs, Net:\n  The storm cost deferrals relate to costs incurred for storm events at CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that each company expects to recover from customers.  A storm must meet certain criteria to qualify for deferral and recovery with the criteria specific to each state jurisdiction and utility company.  Once a storm qualifies for recovery, all qualifying expenses incurred during storm restoration efforts are deferred and recovered from customers.  Costs for storms that do not meet the specific criteria are expensed as incurred.  In addition to storm restoration costs, CL&P and PSNH are each allowed to recover pre-staging storm costs.  Management believes all storm costs deferred were prudently incurred and meet the criteria for specific cost recovery in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and that recovery from customers is probable through the applicable regulatory recovery processes.  Each electric utility company either recovers a carrying charge on its deferred storm cost regulatory asset balance or the regulatory asset balance is included in rate base.  \nMultiple tropical and severe storms over the past several years have caused extensive damage to Eversource’s electric distribution systems resulting in significant numbers and durations of customer outages, along with significant pre-staging costs.  Storms in 2024 that qualified for future recovery resulted in deferred storm restoration costs and pre-staging costs totaling $\n410\n million at Eversource, including $\n134\n million at CL&P, $\n85\n million at NSTAR Electric, and $\n191\n million at PSNH.  Management believes that all of these storm costs were prudently incurred and meet the criteria for specific cost recovery.  Of Eversource’s total deferred storm costs, $\n2.10\n billion either have yet to be filed with the applicable regulatory commission, are pending regulatory approval, or are subject to prudency review (including $\n1.12\n billion at CL&P, $\n551\n million at NSTAR Electric and $\n440\n million at PSNH) as of December 31, 2024.  These storm cost totals exclude storm funding amounts that are collected in rates, which are recorded as a reduction to the deferred storm cost regulatory asset balance.\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are seeking approval of their deferred storm restoration costs through the applicable regulatory recovery process.  As part of CL&P’s October 1, 2021 settlement agreement, CL&P agreed to freeze its current base distribution rates (including storm costs) until no earlier than January 1, 2024.  On March 28, 2024, PURA established a prudency review proceeding for the purpose of receiving and reviewing evidence of the costs reported by CL&P in response to catastrophic storms and pre-staging events totaling approximately $\n634\n million that occurred between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021.  On December 31, 2024, CL&P filed a supplement to its March 2024 prudency review application to request that PURA evaluate the prudence of its costs for nine additional catastrophic storms and two additional pre-staging events for the period January 1, 2022 through January 31, 2023 totaling approximately $\n173\n million.  Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, we continue to believe these deferred storm restoration costs were prudently incurred and are probable of recovery.  \nCL&P’s storm events include the August 4, 2020 Tropical Storm Isaias, which resulted in deferred storm restoration costs of approximately $\n232\n million at CL&P as of December 31, 2024.  Although in 2021 PURA found that CL&P’s performance in its preparation for, and response to, Tropical Storm Isaias fell below applicable performance standards in certain instances, CL&P believes it presented in its 2023 storm filing, credible evidence demonstrating there is no reasonably close causal connection between the alleged sub-standard performance and the storm costs incurred.  While it is possible that some amount of storm costs may be disallowed by PURA, any such amount cannot be estimated at this time.  CL&P continues to believe that these storm restoration costs associated with Tropical Storm Isaias were prudently incurred and meet the criteria for cost recovery.\nRegulatory Tracking Mechanisms:\n \n \nThe regulated companies' approved rates are designed to recover costs incurred to provide service to customers.  The regulated companies recover certain of their costs on a fully-reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms.  The differences between the costs incurred (or the rate recovery allowed) and the actual revenues are recorded as regulatory assets (for undercollections) or as regulatory liabilities (for overcollections) to be included in future customer rates each year.  Carrying charges are recovered in rates on all material regulatory tracking mechanisms.\nThe electric and natural gas distribution companies recover, on a fully reconciling basis, the costs associated with the procurement of energy and natural gas supply, state mandated energy purchase agreements and other energy-related costs, electric transmission related costs from FERC-approved transmission tariffs, energy efficiency programs, low income assistance programs, certain uncollectible accounts receivable for hardship customers, restructuring and stranded costs as a result of deregulation (including securitized RRB charges), certain capital tracking mechanisms for infrastructure improvements, and additionally for the Massachusetts utilities, pension and PBOP benefits, net metering for distributed generation, and solar-related programs. \nCL&P, NSTAR Electric, Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and the Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut each have a regulatory commission approved revenue decoupling mechanism.  Distribution revenues are decoupled from customer sales volumes, where applicable, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues.  Each company reconciles its annual base distribution rate recovery amount to the pre-established levels of baseline distribution delivery service revenues.  Any difference between the allowed level of distribution revenue and the actual amount realized during a 12-month period is adjusted through rates in the following period.  \nBenefit Costs:\n   Deferred benefit costs represent unrecognized actuarial losses and gains and unrecognized prior service costs and credits attributable to Eversource's Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans.  The regulated companies record actuarial losses and gains and prior service costs and credits arising at the December 31st remeasurement date of the funded status of the benefit plans as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability in lieu of a charge to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss), reflecting ultimate recovery from customers through rates.  The regulatory asset or regulatory liability is amortized with the recognition of actuarial losses and gains and prior service costs and credits to net periodic benefit expense/income over the estimated average future employee service period using the corridor approach.  Regulatory accounting is also applied to the portions of Eversource's service company costs that support the regulated companies, as these amounts are also recoverable.  As these regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities do not represent a cash outlay for the regulated companies, no carrying charge is recovered from customers.  See Note 11A, \"Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension,\" for further information on regulatory benefit plan amounts arising and amortized during the year. \n97\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, and PSNH recover benefit costs related to their distribution and transmission operations from customers in rates as allowed by their applicable regulatory commissions.  NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and EGMA recover qualified pension and PBOP expenses related to their distribution operations through a rate reconciling mechanism that fully tracks the change in net pension and PBOP expenses each year.  The electric transmission companies' rates provide for an annual true-up of estimated to actual costs, which include pension and PBOP expenses as allowed by FERC.\nIncome Taxes, Net:\n  The tax effect of temporary book-tax differences (differences between the periods in which transactions affect income in the financial statements and the periods in which they affect the determination of taxable income, including those differences relating to uncertain tax positions) is accounted for in accordance with the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions and accounting guidance for income taxes.  Differences in income taxes between the accounting guidance and the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions are recorded as regulatory assets.  As these assets are offset by deferred income tax liabilities, no carrying charge is collected.  The amortization period of these assets varies depending on the nature and/or remaining life of the underlying assets and liabilities.  For further information regarding income taxes, see Note 12, \"Income Taxes,\" to the financial statements.  \n \nSecuritized Stranded Costs:\n  In 2018, a subsidiary of PSNH issued $\n635.7\n million of securitized RRBs to finance PSNH's unrecovered remaining costs associated with the divestiture of its generation assets.  Securitized regulatory assets, which are not earning an equity return, are being recovered over the amortization period of the associated RRBs. The PSNH RRBs are expected to be repaid by February 1, 2033.  For further information, see Note 10, \"Rate Reduction Bonds and Variable Interest Entities,\" to the financial statements.\nGoodwill-related:\n  The goodwill regulatory asset originated from a 1999 transaction, and the DPU allowed its recovery in NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas rates.  This regulatory asset is currently being amortized and recovered from customers in rates without a carrying charge over a \n40\n-year period, and as of December 31, 2024, there were \n15\n years of amortization remaining.\nAsset Retirement Obligations:\n  The costs associated with the depreciation of the regulated companies' ARO assets and accretion of the ARO liabilities are recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with regulatory accounting guidance.  The regulated companies' ARO assets, regulatory assets, and ARO liabilities offset and are excluded from rate base.  These costs are being recovered over the life of the underlying property, plant and equipment.\nDerivative Liabilities:\n  Regulatory assets are recorded as an offset to derivative liabilities and relate to the fair value of contracts used to purchase energy and energy-related products that will be recovered from customers in future rates.  These assets are excluded from rate base and are being recovered as the actual settlements occur over the duration of the contracts.  See Note 4, \"Derivative Instruments,\" to the financial statements for further information on these contracts.\nOther Regulatory Assets:\n \n \nOther Regulatory Assets primarily include environmental remediation costs, certain uncollectible accounts receivable for hardship customers, contractual obligations associated with the spent nuclear fuel storage costs of the CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC decommissioned nuclear power facilities, removal costs incurred that exceed amounts collected from customers, electric vehicle program costs, certain exogenous property taxes and merger-related costs allowed for recovery, losses associated with the reacquisition or redemption of long-term debt, and various other items.  \nRegulatory Costs in Other Long-Term Assets:\n  Eversource's regulated companies had $\n221.0\n million (including $\n116.3\n million for CL&P, $\n41.1\n million for NSTAR Electric and $\n4.5\n million for PSNH) and $\n241.7\n million (including $\n166.7\n million for CL&P, $\n21.9\n million for NSTAR Electric and $\n1.2\n million for PSNH) of additional regulatory costs not yet specifically approved as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that were included in Other Long-Term Assets on the balance sheets.  These amounts will be reclassified to Regulatory Assets upon approval by the applicable regulatory agency.  Based on regulatory policies or past precedent on similar costs, management believes it is probable that these costs will ultimately be approved and recovered from customers in rates.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, these regulatory costs included $\n92.5\n million (including $\n47.2\n million for CL&P and $\n24.4\n million for NSTAR Electric) and $\n82.1\n million (including $\n64.0\n million for CL&P and $\n7.3\n million for NSTAR Electric), respectively, of deferred uncollectible hardship costs.  \nEquity Return on Regulatory Assets:\n  For rate-making purposes, the regulated companies recover the carrying costs related to their regulatory assets.  For certain regulatory assets, the carrying cost recovered includes an equity return component.  This equity return is not recorded on the balance sheets.  The equity return for PSNH was $\n22.5\n million and $\n10.2\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  These carrying costs will be recovered from customers in future rates.  \n98\nRegulatory Liabilities:  \nThe components of regulatory liabilities were as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(Millions of Dollars)\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nEDIT due to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\n$\n2,442.7\n \n$\n956.6\n \n$\n877.6\n \n$\n330.6\n \n$\n2,548.6\n \n$\n969.2\n \n$\n905.1\n \n$\n339.3\n \nRegulatory Tracking Mechanisms\n702.4\n \n180.3\n \n413.6\n \n114.4\n \n668.3\n \n154.0\n \n347.2\n \n114.4\n \nCost of Removal\n684.1\n \n212.8\n \n451.3\n \n20.1\n \n666.6\n \n157.9\n \n420.9\n \n16.2\n \nDeferred Portion of Non-Service Income\n   Components of Pension, SERP and PBOP\n427.1\n \n61.6\n \n211.6\n \n42.6\n \n354.0\n \n49.9\n \n175.9\n \n36.6\n \nAFUDC - Transmission\n154.8\n \n65.1\n \n89.7\n \n—\n \n124.3\n \n56.1\n \n68.2\n \n—\n \nBenefit Costs\n69.3\n \n4.5\n \n21.4\n \n3.9\n \n51.0\n \n0.6\n \n22.2\n \n—\n \nOther Regulatory Liabilities\n184.5\n \n39.1\n \n14.2\n \n4.5\n \n201.9\n \n30.4\n \n13.9\n \n4.6\n \nTotal Regulatory Liabilities\n4,664.9\n \n1,520.0\n \n2,079.4\n \n516.1\n \n4,614.7\n \n1,418.1\n \n1,953.4\n \n511.1\n \nLess:  Current Portion\n632.3\n \n124.1\n \n436.3\n \n121.1\n \n591.8\n \n102.2\n \n368.1\n \n117.5\n \nTotal Long-Term Regulatory Liabilities\n$\n4,032.6\n \n$\n1,395.9\n \n$\n1,643.1\n \n$\n395.0\n \n$\n4,022.9\n \n$\n1,315.9\n \n$\n1,585.3\n \n$\n393.6\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Regulatory Liabilities attributable to the Aquarion water distribution business have been reclassified to Liabilities Held for Sale on the Eversource balance sheet.  As of December 31, 2023, these balances were recorded within Regulatory Liabilities on the Eversource balance sheet.  For further information, see Note 24, “Assets Held for Sale.”\nEDIT due to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017:\n  Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Eversource had remeasured its existing deferred federal income tax balances to reflect the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.  The remeasurement resulted in provisional regulated excess accumulated deferred income tax (excess ADIT or EDIT) liabilities that will benefit customers in future periods and were recognized as regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet.  EDIT liabilities related to property, plant, and equipment are subject to IRS normalization rules and will be returned to customers using the same timing as the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets that gave rise to the ADIT liabilities.  Eversource's regulated companies are in the process of refunding the EDIT liabilities to customers based on orders issued by applicable state and federal regulatory commissions.\nCost of Removal:\n  Eversource's regulated companies currently recover amounts in rates for future costs of removal of plant assets over the lives of the assets.  The estimated cost to remove utility assets from service is recognized as a component of depreciation expense, and the cumulative amount collected from customers but not yet expended is recognized as a regulatory liability.  Expended removal costs that exceed amounts collected from customers are recognized as regulatory assets, as they are probable of recovery in future rates.\nDeferred Portion of Non-Service Income Components of Pension, SERP and PBOP:\n  Regulatory liabilities were recorded for the deferred portion of the non-service related components of net periodic benefit expense/(income) for the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans. These regulatory liabilities will be amortized over the remaining useful lives of the various classes of utility property, plant and equipment.\nAFUDC - Transmission:\n  Regulatory liabilities were recorded by CL&P and NSTAR Electric for AFUDC accrued on certain reliability-related transmission projects to reflect local rate base recovery.  These regulatory liabilities will be amortized over the depreciable life of the related transmission assets.\nOther Regulatory Liabilities:\n \n \nOther Regulatory Liabilities primarily include EGMA’s acquired regulatory liability as a result of the 2020 DPU-approved rate settlement agreement and the CMA asset acquisition on October 9, 2020, and various other items.  \nFERC ROE Complaints:\n  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Eversource has a reserve established for the second ROE complaint period in the pending FERC ROE complaint proceedings, which was recorded as a regulatory liability and is reflected within Regulatory Tracking Mechanisms in the table above.  The cumulative pre-tax reserve (excluding interest) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 totaled $\n39.1\n million for Eversource (including $\n21.4\n million for CL&P, $\n14.6\n million for NSTAR Electric and $\n3.1\n million for PSNH).  See Note 13E, \"Commitments and Contingencies – FERC ROE Complaints,\" for further information on developments in the pending ROE complaint proceedings.\nRegulatory Developments:\nCL&P RAM Filing:\n  On April 17, 2024, PURA issued an interim decision in CL&P’s RAM filing and approved rates for six RAM components, with rates effective July 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  The rate approvals include the recovery of NBFMCC and SBC net underrecoveries as of December 31, 2023 of $\n264.9\n million and $\n86.2\n million, respectively, and the recovery of expected net costs of $\n388.5\n million for the NBFMCC and $\n254.4\n million for the SBC for the period July 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  The NBFMCC rate adjustment is primarily driven by long-term nuclear power purchase agreements required by state policy (Millstone and Seabrook) and the SBC rate adjustment is primarily driven by costs associated with accounts receivable hardship customer protection and the new low-income discount rate effective December 2023. On August 14, 2024, PURA issued a final decision that approved a further adjustment to the NBFMCC rate to include the recovery of incurred and deferred electric vehicle program costs from 2021 through May 31, 2024 of $\n44.4\n million and expected electric vehicle program costs from June 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 of $\n24.3\n million.  The $\n44.4\n million, plus $\n5.4\n million in carrying costs, will be recovered over a \n20-month\n period of September 1, 2024 through April 30, 2026, and the $\n24.3\n million will be recovered over an \neight-month\n period of September 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  In addition, PURA approved an incremental $\n3.5\n million of 2024 Innovative Energy Solutions program costs and \n99\n$\n1.5\n million of Connecticut Green Bank program costs over an eight-month period of September 1, 2024 through April 30, 2025.  These amounts are included in the “Public Benefits” portion of the customer bills in Connecticut.\nYankee Gas Distribution Rate Case:\n  On November 12, 2024, Yankee Gas filed an application with PURA to amend its existing distribution rates for effect on November 1, 2025.  Yankee Gas’s rate application requested approval of a distribution rate increase of $\n209\n million, which included a base distribution rate increase of $\n274\n million partially offset by a reduction of $\n65\n million in the combined Gas System Improvements and System Expansion Reconciliation rates.  In addition, Yankee Gas requested approval to implement a rate credit of $\n37.4\n million to offset the PGA rate for non-firm margin credits over one year beginning November 1, 2025.  As part of the rate case, Yankee Gas proposed to implement a multi-year performance-based rate making plan with a four-year initial term from November 1, 2025 to October 31, 2029 that would adjust rates annually and includes performance metrics.  A final decision by PURA is expected in October 2025.\nNSTAR Electric Distribution Rates\n:  NSTAR Electric’s performance based regulation (PBR) mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation, exogenous events and future capital additions based on a historical five-year average of total capital additions.  On September 16, 2024, NSTAR Electric submitted its annual PBR Adjustment filing for a $\n55.8\n million increase to base distribution rates, for effect on January 1, 2025.  The requested base distribution rate increase is comprised of a $\n35.3\n million inflation-based adjustment and a $\n20.5\n million adjustment for capital additions based on the difference between the historical \nfive-year\n average of total capital additions and the base capital revenue requirement.  On December 23, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nNSTAR Electric submitted its first annual PBR Adjustment filing on September 15, 2023 and on December 26, 2023, the DPU approved a $\n104.9\n million increase to base distribution rates effective January 1, 2024.  The base distribution rate increase was comprised of a $\n50.6\n million inflation-based adjustment and a $\n54.3\n million adjustment for capital additions based on the difference between the historical \nfive-year\n average of total capital additions and the base capital revenue requirement.\nNSTAR Gas Distribution Rates:\n  NSTAR Gas’ PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation and exogenous events.  On September 16, 2024, NSTAR Gas submitted its annual PBR Adjustment filing for a $\n12.7\n million increase to base distribution rates for effect on November 1, 2024.  On October 30, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nNSTAR Gas submitted its third annual PBR Adjustment filing on September 15, 2023 and on October 30, 2023, the DPU approved a $\n25.4\n million increase to base distribution rates, of which, $\n15.5\n million was associated with a base rate adjustment and the remainder for a prior period exogenous cost adjustment, for effect on November 1, 2023.\nEGMA Distribution Rates:\n  On November 4, 2024, EGMA submitted a revised filing for its first rate base reset for rates to be effective November 1, 2024, in accordance with an October 7, 2020 EGMA Rate Settlement Agreement approved by the DPU.  The compliance filing was ordered by the DPU on October 31, 2024.  The rate base reset occurring on November 1, 2024 adjusted distribution rates to account for capital additions (including the roll-in of GSEP capital additions), depreciation expense, property taxes, and return on rate base for capital additions placed into service through December 31, 2023.  The total revenue requirement calculated for the first rate base reset is an increase to base distribution rates of $\n147.8\n million, of which $\n34.0\n million is associated with GSEP investments through December 31, 2023.  Under the terms of the Rate Settlement Agreement, EGMA applied a cap on the revenue change effective November 1, 2024, and the amount in excess of the cap will be deferred for recovery through the Local Distribution Adjustment Clause (LDAC) on May 1, 2025, including carrying charges.  After adjusting for the cap, the increase to base distribution rates is $\n85.6\n million effective November 1, 2024 (of which $\n8.8\n million is offset by a reduction in the GSEP revenue requirement and GSEP rate also taking effect on November 1, 2024 for a net distribution rate change on November 1, 2024 of $\n76.8\n million).  Base distribution rates will be increased effective November 1, 2025 to incorporate the $\n62.2\n million remaining revenue requirement.  On November 7, 2024, the DPU approved this filing.\nPSNH Distribution Rate Case\n:  On June 11, 2024, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for approval of a temporary annual base distribution rate increase.  On July 31, 2024, the NHPUC approved a settlement agreement that was reached by PSNH, New Hampshire Department of Energy, and the Office of the Consumer Advocate to implement a temporary annual base distribution rate increase of $\n61.2\n million effective August 1, 2024.\nAlso on June 11, 2024, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC to request an increase in permanent base distribution rates of $\n181.9\n million, which is inclusive of the temporary rate increase, and proposed to take effect August 1, 2025.  The temporary rates are subject to reconciliation based on the outcome of the permanent rate case back to the date when temporary rates took effect.  The permanent rate increase request includes $\n247\n million in unrecovered storm costs to be recovered over a \nfive-year\n period.  As part of the rate case, PSNH proposed to implement a performance-based rate making plan that would adjust rates annually over a \nfour-year\n term, with a commitment to not file another rate case for at least \nfour years\n.  The plan includes a revenue-cap formula adjusted for inflation, a supplemental capital adjustment formula to support PSNH’s planned capital infrastructure improvements, an exogenous events recovery mechanism, performance metrics and an earnings sharing mechanism, among others.  If the NHPUC approves the performance-based rate making plan as proposed, the previously established RRA and PPAM rate reconciling mechanisms and lost base revenues will be eliminated.  The NHPUC is permitted up to twelve months to investigate the proposed rates and issue a final order.  A decision by the NHPUC on permanent rates is expected by August 1, 2025.\n100\n2023 PSNH Pole Acquisition Approval:\n  On November 18, 2022, the NHPUC issued a decision that approved a proposed purchase agreement between PSNH and Consolidated Communications, in which, PSNH would acquire both jointly-owned and solely-owned poles and pole assets.  The NHPUC also authorized PSNH to recover certain expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of the transferred poles, pole inspections, and vegetation management expenses through a new cost recovery mechanism, the Pole Plant Adjustment Mechanism (PPAM), subject to consummation of the purchase agreement.  The purchase agreement was finalized on May 1, 2023 for a purchase price of $\n23.3\n million.  Upon consummation of the purchase agreement, PSNH established a regulatory asset of $\n16.9\n million for operation and maintenance expenses and vegetation management expenses associated with the purchased poles incurred from February 10, 2021 through April 30, 2023 that PSNH is authorized to collect through the PPAM regulatory tracking mechanism.  The establishment of the PPAM regulatory asset resulted in a pre-tax benefit recorded in Amortization expense on the PSNH statement of income in 2023.\n3.     \nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION\nUtility property, plant and equipment is recorded at original cost.  Original cost includes materials, labor, construction overheads and AFUDC for regulated property.  The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to Operations and Maintenance expense as incurred.  \nThe following tables summarize property, plant and equipment by asset category:\nEversource\nAs of December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\nDistribution - Electric\n$\n21,144.1\n \n$\n19,656.5\n \nDistribution - Natural Gas\n8,922.2\n \n8,155.3\n \nTransmission - Electric\n16,130.9\n \n14,666.8\n \nDistribution - Water \n(1)\n—\n \n2,280.1\n \nSolar\n201.0\n \n201.1\n \nUtility\n46,398.2\n \n44,959.8\n \nOther \n(2)\n2,254.1\n \n2,006.8\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Gross\n48,652.3\n \n46,966.6\n \nLess:  Accumulated Depreciation\n \n \nUtility    \n(\n9,636.5\n)\n(\n9,670.1\n)\nOther\n(\n1,044.1\n)\n(\n869.6\n)\nTotal Accumulated Depreciation\n(\n10,680.6\n)\n(\n10,539.7\n)\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n37,971.7\n \n36,426.9\n \nConstruction Work in Progress\n3,014.9\n \n3,071.7\n \nTotal Property, Plant and Equipment, Net\n$\n40,986.6\n \n$\n39,498.6\n \n \nAs of December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nDistribution - Electric\n$\n8,437.9\n \n$\n9,782.3\n \n$\n2,964.2\n \n$\n7,897.1\n \n$\n9,000.5\n \n$\n2,799.2\n \nTransmission - Electric\n6,937.7\n \n6,375.2\n \n2,819.6\n \n6,548.2\n \n5,630.8\n \n2,489.5\n \nSolar\n—\n \n201.0\n \n—\n \n—\n \n201.1\n \n—\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Gross\n15,375.6\n \n16,358.5\n \n5,783.8\n \n14,445.3\n \n14,832.4\n \n5,288.7\n \nLess:  Accumulated Depreciation\n(\n2,928.0\n)\n(\n3,782.0\n)\n(\n1,032.3\n)\n(\n2,670.5\n)\n(\n3,585.9\n)\n(\n984.0\n)\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n12,447.6\n \n12,576.5\n \n4,751.5\n \n11,774.8\n \n11,246.5\n \n4,304.7\n \nConstruction Work in Progress\n554.6\n \n1,461.3\n \n338.4\n \n565.4\n \n1,507.3\n \n270.0\n \nTotal Property, Plant and Equipment, Net\n$\n13,002.2\n \n$\n14,037.8\n \n$\n5,089.9\n \n$\n12,340.2\n \n$\n12,753.8\n \n$\n4,574.7\n \n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024, the property, plant and equipment balance, net of accumulated depreciation, attributable to the Aquarion water distribution business has been reclassified to Assets Held for Sale on the Eversource balance sheet.

For further information, see Note 24, “Assets Held for Sale.”\n(2)\nThese assets are primarily comprised of computer software, hardware and equipment at Eversource Service and buildings at The Rocky River Realty Company.\nDepreciation: \n Depreciation of utility assets is calculated on a straight-line basis using composite rates based on the estimated remaining useful lives of the various classes of property (estimated useful life for PSNH distribution and the water utilities).  The composite rates, which are subject to approval by the appropriate state regulatory agency, include a cost of removal component, which is collected from customers over the lives of the plant assets and is recognized as a regulatory liability.  Depreciation rates are applied to property from the time it is placed in service.\nUpon retirement from service, the cost of the utility asset is charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation.  The actual incurred removal costs are applied against the related regulatory liability.  \n101\nThe depreciation rates for the various classes of utility property, plant and equipment aggregate to composite rates as follows:\n(Percent)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEversource\n3.2\n \n%\n3.1\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\nCL&P\n2.9\n \n%\n2.8\n \n%\n2.8\n \n%\nNSTAR Electric\n2.8\n \n%\n2.7\n \n%\n2.7\n \n%\nPSNH\n3.0\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\nThe following table summarizes average remaining useful lives of depreciable assets:  \n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n(Years)\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nDistribution - Electric\n33.4\n34.7\n33.4\n29.9\nDistribution - Natural Gas\n34.7\n— \n— \n— \nTransmission - Electric\n39.7\n35.8\n45.1\n39.8\nDistribution - Water\n45.2\n— \n— \n— \nSolar\n22.8\n— \n22.8\n— \nOther \n(1)\n9.9\n— \n— \n— \n(1)\nThe estimated useful life of computer software, hardware and equipment primarily ranges from \n5\n to \n15\n years and of buildings is \n40\n years.\n4.     \nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  \nThe electric and natural gas companies purchase and procure energy and energy-related products, which are subject to price volatility, for their customers.  The costs associated with supplying energy to customers are recoverable from customers in future rates.  These regulated companies manage the risks associated with the price volatility of energy and energy-related products through the use of derivative and non-derivative contracts.  Many of the derivative contracts meet the definition of, and are designated as, normal and qualify for accrual accounting under the applicable accounting guidance.  The costs and benefits of derivative contracts that meet the definition of normal are recognized in Operating Expenses on the statements of income as electricity or natural gas is delivered.\nDerivative contracts that are not designated as normal are recorded at fair value as derivative assets or liabilities on the balance sheets.  For the electric and natural gas companies, regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities are recorded to offset the fair values of derivatives, as contract settlement amounts are recovered from, or refunded to, customers in their respective energy supply rates.  \nThe gross fair values of derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are offset and reported as net Derivative Assets or Derivative Liabilities, with current and long-term portions, on the balance sheets.  \nThe following table presents the gross fair values of contracts, categorized by risk type, and the net amounts recorded as current or long-term derivative assets or liabilities:\n \nAs of December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nCL&P\n(Millions of Dollars)\nFair Value Hierarchy\nCommodity Supply\nand Price Risk\nManagement\nNetting \n(1)\nNet Amount\nRecorded as\na Derivative\nCommodity Supply\nand Price Risk\nManagement\nNetting \n(1)\nNet Amount\nRecorded as\na Derivative\nCurrent Derivative Assets\nLevel 2\n$\n14.2\n \n$\n(\n0.3\n)\n$\n13.9\n \n$\n16.4\n \n$\n(\n0.5\n)\n$\n15.9\n \nLong-Term Derivative Assets\nLevel 2\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n13.6\n \n(\n0.5\n)\n13.1\n \nCurrent Derivative Liabilities\nLevel 2\n(\n71.1\n)\n—\n \n(\n71.1\n)\n(\n81.9\n)\n—\n \n(\n81.9\n)\nLong-Term Derivative Liabilities\nLevel 2\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n68.0\n)\n—\n \n(\n68.0\n)\n(1)\n     Amounts represent derivative assets and liabilities that Eversource elected to record net on the balance sheets.  These amounts are subject to master netting agreements or similar agreements for which the right of offset exists.\nThe business activities that result in the recognition of derivative assets also create exposure to various counterparties.  As of December 31, 2024, CL&P's derivative assets were exposed to counterparty credit risk and contracted with investment grade entities.\nDerivative Contracts at Fair Value with Offsetting Regulatory Amounts\nCommodity Supply and Price Risk Management\n:  As required by regulation, CL&P, along with UI, has capacity-related contracts with generation facilities.  CL&P has a sharing agreement with UI, with \n80\n percent of the costs or benefits of each contract borne by or allocated to CL&P and \n20\n percent borne by or allocated to UI.  The combined capacities of these contracts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were \n610\n MW and \n682\n MW, respectively.  The capacity contracts extend through 2026 and obligate both CL&P and UI to make or receive payments on a monthly basis to or from the generation facilities based on the difference between a set capacity price and the capacity market price received in the ISO-NE capacity markets.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were losses of $\n3.8\n million, losses of $\n3.9\n million and gains of $\n10.1\n million, respectively.  These changes in fair value associated with CL&P’s derivative contracts are deferred in Regulatory Assets on the balance sheet.\n102\nFair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments\nThe fair value of derivative contracts utilizes both observable and unobservable inputs.  The fair value is modeled using income techniques, such as discounted cash flow valuations adjusted for assumptions related to exit price.  Valuations of derivative contracts using a discounted cash flow methodology include assumptions regarding the timing and likelihood of scheduled capacity payments and also reflect non-performance risk, including credit, using the default probability approach based on the counterparty’s credit rating for assets and the Company’s credit rating for liabilities.  Significant observable inputs for valuations of these contracts include energy-related product prices in future years for which quoted prices in an active market exist.  Valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using historical market transactions adjusted for the terms of the contract.  Fair value measurements were prepared by individuals with expertise in valuation techniques, pricing of energy-related products, and accounting requirements.  All derivative contracts were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nThe following table presents changes in the Level 3 category of derivative assets and derivative liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  The derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis.\nCL&P\n(Millions of Dollars)\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nDerivatives, Net:\nFair Value as of Beginning of Period\n$\n(\n181.8\n)\nNet Realized/Unrealized Losses Included in Regulatory Assets\n(\n3.9\n)\nSettlements\n64.8\n \nTransfers out of Level 3 \n(1)\n120.9\n \nFair Value as of End of Period\n$\n—\n \n(1)    \nTransfers out of Level 3 pertain to certain significant valuation inputs becoming observable as well as certain unobservable inputs no longer being significant to the fair value of the derivative contracts.  Eversource's policy is to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period.\n5.     \nMARKETABLE SECURITIES\nEversource’s marketable securities include the CYAPC and YAEC legally restricted trusts that each hold equity and available-for-sale debt securities to fund the spent nuclear fuel removal obligations of their nuclear fuel storage facilities.  Eversource also holds trusts that are not subject to regulatory oversight by state or federal agencies that are primarily used to fund certain non-qualified executive benefits. The marketable securities within the non-qualified executive benefit trusts were sold in 2023.  Equity and available-for-sale debt marketable securities are recorded at fair value, with the current portion recorded in Prepayments and Other Current Assets and the long-term portion recorded in Marketable Securities on the balance sheets.  CYAPC and YAEC’s spent nuclear fuel trusts are restricted and are classified in long-term Marketable Securities on the balance sheets.\nEquity Securities:\n  Eversource's equity securities include CYAPC's and YAEC's marketable securities held in spent nuclear fuel trusts, which had fair values of $\n163.1\n million and $\n173.6\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Unrealized gains and losses for these spent nuclear fuel trusts are subject to regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded in Marketable Securities with the corresponding offset to long-term liabilities on the balance sheets, with no impact on the statements of income.\nUnrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in other trusts are recorded in Other Income, Net on the statements of income.  The equity securities within Eversource’s non-qualified executive benefits trusts were sold during 2023 and resulted in a $\n1.1\n million gain recorded in Other Income, Net for the year ended December 31, 2023.  The remaining equity securities held in Eversource’s trusts as of December 31, 2024 of $\n4.1\n million were reclassified to Assets Held for Sale on the Eversource balance sheet.  As of December 31, 2023, these equity securities totaled $\n3.3\n million and there were unrealized gains of $\n0.6\n million recorded in Other Income, Net in 2023.  For further information, see Note 24, “Assets Held for Sale.”\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities:\n  \nThe following is a summary of available-for-sale debt securities, which are held in CYAPC’s and YAEC’s spent nuclear fuel trusts:\n \nAs of December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nEversource\n(Millions of Dollars)\nAmortized\nCost\nPre-Tax\nUnrealized\nGains\nPre-Tax\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair Value\nAmortized\nCost\nPre-Tax\nUnrealized\nGains\nPre-Tax\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair Value\nDebt Securities\n$\n163.2\n \n$\n0.1\n \n$\n(\n6.1\n)\n$\n157.2\n \n$\n169.5\n \n$\n1.4\n \n$\n(\n6.6\n)\n$\n164.3\n \nUnrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale debt securities included in the CYAPC and YAEC spent nuclear fuel trusts are subject to regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded in Marketable Securities with the corresponding offset to long-term liabilities on the balance sheets, with no impact on the statements of income.    \n103\nAny unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities held in other trusts are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, excluding amounts related to credit losses or losses on securities intended to be sold, which are recorded in Other Income, Net.  The debt securities within Eversource’s non-qualified executive benefits trusts were sold during 2023.  There were $\n1.2\n million of realized losses recorded on securities sold for the year ended December 31, 2023 that were reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and recorded in Other Income, Net.  There were no credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and no allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024.  Factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists include adverse conditions specifically affecting the issuer, the payment history, ratings and rating changes of the security, and the severity of the impairment.  For asset-backed debt securities, underlying collateral and expected future cash flows are also evaluated. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the contractual maturities of available-for-sale debt securities were as follows:    \nEversource\n(Millions of Dollars)\nAmortized \nCost\nFair \nValue\nLess than one year\n$\n11.3\n \n$\n11.7\n \nOne to five years\n35.6\n \n35.6\n \nSix to ten years\n43.5\n \n42.6\n \nGreater than ten years\n72.8\n \n67.3\n \nTotal Debt Securities\n$\n163.2\n \n$\n157.2\n \nRealized Gains and Losses:  \nRealized gains and losses are offset in long-term liabilities for CYAPC and YAEC and are recorded in Other Income, Net for Eversource's benefit trusts.  Eversource utilizes the average cost basis method for the CYAPC and YAEC spent nuclear fuel trusts and the specific identification basis method for the Eversource non-qualified benefit trusts to compute the realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities.\nFair Value Measurements:  \nThe following table presents the marketable securities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis by the level in which they are classified within the fair value hierarchy:\nEversource\n(Millions of Dollars)\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nLevel 1:  \n \n \nMutual Funds and Equities\n$\n163.1\n \n$\n176.9\n \nMoney Market Funds\n10.0\n \n13.7\n \nTotal Level 1\n$\n173.1\n \n$\n190.6\n \nLevel 2:\n \n \nU.S. Government Issued Debt Securities (Agency and Treasury)\n$\n92.0\n \n$\n90.1\n \nCorporate Debt Securities\n32.5\n \n34.0\n \nAsset-Backed Debt Securities\n7.8\n \n5.6\n \nMunicipal Bonds\n6.8\n \n9.8\n \nOther Fixed Income Securities\n8.1\n \n11.1\n \nTotal Level 2\n$\n147.2\n \n$\n150.6\n \nTotal Marketable Securities\n$\n320.3\n \n$\n341.2\n \nU.S. government issued debt securities are valued using market approaches that incorporate transactions for the same or similar bonds and adjustments for yields and maturity dates.  Corporate debt securities are valued using a market approach, utilizing recent trades of the same or similar instruments and also incorporating yield curves, credit spreads and specific bond terms and conditions.  Asset-backed debt securities include collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage backed securities, and securities collateralized by auto loans, credit card loans or receivables.  Asset-backed debt securities are valued using recent trades of similar instruments, prepayment assumptions, yield curves, issuance and maturity dates, and tranche information.  Municipal bonds are valued using a market approach that incorporates reported trades and benchmark yields.  Other fixed income securities are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, and discounted cash flows.\n6.     \nINVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nInvestments in entities that are not consolidated are included in long-term assets on the balance sheets.  Investments in affiliates where Eversource has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee are initially recognized as an equity method investment at cost.  Earnings impacts from these equity investments are included in Other Income, Net on the statements of income.  \nEversource's investments accounted for under the equity method include the following:\n \nInvestment Balance as of December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\nOwnership Interest\n2024\n2023\nOffshore Wind Business\n50\n%\n-\n100\n%\n$\n22.2\n \n$\n515.5\n \nNatural Gas Pipeline - Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC\n15\n%\n112.6\n \n116.0\n \nOther \nvarious\n33.9\n \n29.0\n \nTotal Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\n$\n168.7\n \n$\n660.5\n \n104\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Eversource had equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $\n51.9\n million, $\n15.5\n million, and $\n22.9\n million, respectively.  Eversource received dividends from its equity method investees (excluding proceeds received from sale or liquidation of investments) of $\n20.5\n million, $\n20.1\n million, and $\n26.2\n million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nOffshore Wind Business:\n  Eversource’s previous offshore wind business included \n50\n percent ownership interests in each of North East Offshore and South Fork Class B Member, LLC.  During 2024, Eversource sold its interest in these entities, and in doing so, sold its interests in the Revolution Wind project, the South Fork Wind project, and the Sunrise Wind project.  Eversource’s current offshore wind business is now comprised only of a noncontrolling tax equity investment in South Fork Wind through a \n100\n percent ownership in South Fork Wind Holdings, LLC Class A interests.   \nOn May 25, 2023, Eversource announced that it had completed a strategic review of its offshore wind investments and determined that it would pursue the sale of its offshore wind investments.  On September 7, 2023, Eversource completed the sale of its \n50\n percent interest in an uncommitted lease area consisting of approximately \n175,000\n developable acres located \n25\n miles off the south coast of Massachusetts to Ørsted for $\n625\n million in an all-cash transaction.  \nIn September of 2023, Eversource made a $\n528\n million investment in a tax equity interest for South Fork Wind.  South Fork Wind was restructured as a tax equity investment, with Eversource purchasing \n100\n percent ownership of a new Class A tax equity membership interest.  This investment will result in Eversource receiving cash flow benefits from investment tax credits (ITC) and other future cash flow benefits as well.  As of December 31, 2024, $\n459\n million of expected investment tax credits and other expected tax benefits were reclassified from the South Fork Wind tax equity investment balance reported in Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates as a decrease in Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes on the Eversource balance sheet, which represented a non-cash reclassification.  As a result of these investment tax credits, Eversource expects lower federal income tax payments from 2025 to 2027.  As of December 31, 2024, the tax equity interest in South Fork Wind totaled $\n22.2\n million. \nOn January 24, 2024, Eversource entered into an agreement with Ørsted to sell Eversource’s \n50\n percent share of Sunrise Wind, subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals.  On April 18, 2024, Eversource and Ørsted executed an equity and asset purchase agreement and on July 9, 2024, Eversource completed the sale of its \n50\n percent ownership share of Sunrise Wind to Ørsted.  In accordance with the equity and asset purchase agreement and after adjustment for a reduction in capital spending compared to forecasted amounts, adjusted proceeds totaled $\n152\n million.  Ørsted paid Eversource $\n118\n million at the closing of the sale transaction, which was used to repay parent company debt.  Remaining proceeds of $\n34\n million will be paid after onshore construction is completed and certain other construction milestones are achieved.  The remaining expected proceeds have been recorded in Other Long-Term Assets on Eversource’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.  Eversource recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of Sunrise Wind of $\n377\n million in 2024.  With completion of the sale, Eversource does not have any ongoing financial obligations associated with Sunrise Wind. \nOn February 13, 2024, Eversource executed an agreement to sell its \n50\n percent interests in the South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for an initial gross purchase price of approximately $\n1.1\n billion.  The initial purchase price was subject to adjustment based on, among other things, the progress, timing and the construction cost of Revolution Wind, including changes in actual versus forecasted capital spending between signing the agreement and closing of the transaction.  On September 30, 2024, Eversource completed the sale of its \n50\n percent ownership share in the South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects to GIP for adjusted gross proceeds of $\n745\n million, which were received at closing.  Adjusted gross proceeds from the sale were approximately $\n375\n million lower than the previously estimated purchase price.  This reduction reflects approximately $\n150\n million resulting from lower capital spending between signing the agreement and closing, and approximately $\n225\n million related to the final terms of the sale transaction, primarily due to the delay of the commercial operations date of Revolution Wind.  Proceeds from the transaction were used to repay parent company debt.\nAs part of the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind sale, Eversource and GIP agreed to make certain post-closing purchase price adjustment payments, which could further impact the final purchase price.  The post-closing purchase price adjustment payments include cost sharing obligations that require Eversource to share equally with GIP in GIP’s funding obligations up to an effective cap of approximately $\n240\n million of incremental capital expenditure overruns incurred during the construction phase for Revolution Wind, after which Eversource will have responsibility for GIP’s obligations for any additional capital expenditure overruns in excess of this amount.  The purchase price is also subject to post-closing adjustments as a result of final project economics, which includes Eversource’s obligation to maintain GIP’s internal rate of return through the construction period for each project as specified in the agreement.  Post-closing purchase price adjustment payments will be made following the commercial operation date of Revolution Wind.  South Fork Wind has achieved commercial operation, and Eversource is in the process of finalizing the construction cost post-close purchase price adjustment payment related to this project, which is not expected to be material. \nUpon the completion of both sale transactions in 2024, the total proceeds were compared to the carrying value of the investments, including an estimate of liability for post-closing adjustment payments to GIP, and Eversource recognized an aggregate, net after-tax loss on the sales of its offshore wind investments of $\n524\n million.  The aggregate, net after-tax loss is comprised of (1) the lower proceeds related to final terms of the sale transaction to GIP of approximately $\n225\n million related to non-construction costs for the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects, primarily due to a purchase price reduction of $\n150\n million resulting from the delay of the commercial operations date of Revolution Wind, (2) recently identified forecasted construction costs as a result of a delay in the anticipated commercial operation date related to Revolution Wind of approximately $\n350\n million, which includes an estimate for the anticipated post-closing adjustment to GIP related to Eversource’s expected cost overrun sharing obligation, and (3) approximately $\n326\n million, which includes an estimate for the anticipated post-closing adjustment related to Eversource’s expected obligations to GIP as a result of final economics of the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects and other future \n105\ncosts, as well as a net $\n60\n million increase in income tax expense including an increase in the valuation allowance for unused capital losses.  These losses were partially offset by the $\n377\n million gain on the sale of Sunrise Wind. \nUpon sale, Eversource recorded a contingent liability of $\n365\n million, reflecting its estimate of the future obligations under the GIP sale terms, which include the expected cost overrun sharing obligation, expected obligation to maintain GIP’s internal rate of return, and obligation for other future costs.  The majority of this liability is expected to be settled upon the completion of the Revolution Wind project.  The long-term portion of the liability of $\n350\n million is recorded in Other Long-Term Liabilities, and $\n15\n million is recorded in Other Current Liabilities on Eversource’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. \nContingencies are evaluated using the best information available at the time the financial statements are prepared, and this assessment involves judgments and assumptions about future events.  Factors that could increase the post-closing adjustment payments owed to GIP include the ultimate cost of construction and extent of cost overruns for Revolution Wind, delays in construction, which would impact the economics associated with the purchase price adjustment, and Revolution Wind’s eligibility for federal investment tax credits at a lower value than assumed and included in the purchase price.  \nThe purchase price included the sales value related to a \n40\n percent level of federal investment tax credits, \n10\n percent of which is the energy community investment tax credit (ITC) adder included in the Inflation Reduction Act of approximately $\n170\n million related to Revolution Wind.  Although management believes the ITC adder value is realizable, there is some uncertainty at this time as to whether those ITC adders can be achieved, and management continues to evaluate the project’s qualifications and to monitor guidance issued by the United States Treasury Department.  A change in the expected value or qualification of ITC adders could result in a significant loss in a future period.\nNew information or future developments that arise as construction progresses and as cost estimates are reviewed and revised will require a reassessment of the estimated liability for the post-closing adjustment payments.  The Company is currently aware that construction of the offshore foundations, offshore substation and turbine tower installations could result in increased cost overruns in the future.  Only preliminary construction cost projections are available for these cost overruns, and there is insufficient updated information at this point in order for Eversource to change its estimate with reasonably estimable information.  Eversource will continue to assess the potential exposure and adjust the liability as needed.  It is expected that updated costs estimates will become available in the first half of 2025, and adverse changes in facts and circumstances could result in additional losses that could be material.  The Company believes it is reasonably possible that there is an additional loss in excess of the liability recorded, but management cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss beyond the $\n365\n million recorded at this time.  \nTotal net proceeds could also be adjusted for a benefit due to Eversource if there are lower operation costs or higher availability of the projects through the period that is four years following the commercial operation of Revolution Wind.  \nUnder the agreement with GIP, Eversource’s existing and certain additional credit support obligations for Revolution Wind are expected to roll off as the project completes construction.  Under the agreement with Ørsted, Eversource’s existing credit support obligations for Sunrise Wind were either terminated or indemnified by Ørsted as a result of the sale.  Eversource has entered into separate construction management agreements to manage Sunrise Wind’s and Revolution Wind’s onshore electric substation construction through completion. In this role, Eversource will be solely a service provider to Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind.\n2023 Impairments:\n  Equity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist as of the balance sheet date that indicate that the fair value of the investment may be less than book value.  Eversource continually monitors and evaluates its equity method investments to determine if there are indicators of an other-than-temporary impairment.  If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.  Impairment evaluations are based on best information available at the impairment assessment date.  Subsequent declines or recoveries after the reporting date are not considered in the impairment recognized.  Investments that are other-than-temporarily impaired and written down to their estimated fair value cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value.  Impairment evaluations involve a significant degree of judgment and estimation, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist at the equity method investment level, selecting discount rates used to determine fair values, and developing an estimate of discounted future cash flows expected from investment operations or the sale of the investment.  \nDuring 2023, in connection with the process to divest its offshore wind business, Eversource identified indicators for impairment in both the second and fourth quarters of 2023.  In each impairment assessment, Eversource evaluated its investments and determined that the carrying value of the equity method offshore wind investments exceeded the fair value of the investments and that the decline in fair value was other-than-temporary.  The completion of the strategic review in the second quarter of 2023 resulted in Eversource recording a pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charge of $\n401\n million ($\n331\n million after-tax) to reflect the investment at estimated fair value based on the expected sales price at that time. This established a new cost basis in the investments.  Negative developments in the fourth quarter of 2023, including a lower expected sales price, additional projected construction cost increases, and the October 2023 OREC pricing denial for Sunrise Wind, resulted in Eversource conducting an impairment evaluation and recognizing an additional pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charge of $\n1.77\n billion ($\n1.62\n billion after-tax) and establishing a new cost basis in the investments as of December 31, 2023.  The Eversource statement of income for the year ended 2023 reflects a total pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charge of $\n2.17\n billion ($\n1.95\n billion after-tax) in its offshore wind investments.  The impairment charges were non-cash charges and did not impact Eversource’s cash position at the time of the impairment.  Eversource’s offshore wind investments did not meet the criteria to qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. \n106\nThe 2023 impairment evaluations involved judgments in developing the estimates and timing of the future cash flows arising from the expected sales price of Eversource’s \n50\n percent interest in the wind projects, including expected sales value from investment tax credit adder amounts, less estimated costs to sell, and uncertainties related to the Sunrise Wind re-bid process in New York’s offshore wind solicitation in 2024.  Additional assumptions in the fourth quarter 2023 assessment included revised projected construction costs and estimated project cost overruns, management’s assumption that the Sunrise Wind project would ultimately be abandoned, estimated termination costs, salvage values of Sunrise Wind assets, and the value of the tax equity ownership interest. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses were subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity.  All significant inputs into the impairment evaluations were Level 3 fair value measurements. \nA summary of the significant estimates and assumptions included in the 2023 impairment charges is as follows:\nSecond Quarter 2023\nFourth Quarter 2023\nTotal\n(Millions of Dollars)\nLower expected sales proceeds across all three wind projects\n$\n401\n \n$\n525\n \n$\n926\n \nExpected cost overruns not recovered in the sales price \n—\n \n441\n \n441\n \nLoss of sales value from the sale price offered by GIP, including loss of ITC adders value, cancellation costs and other impacts assuming Sunrise Wind project is abandoned\n—\n \n800\n \n800\n \nImpairment Charges, pre-tax\n401\n \n1,766\n \n2,167\n \nTax Benefit\n(\n70\n)\n(\n144\n)\n(\n214\n)\nImpairment Charges, after-tax\n$\n331\n \n$\n1,622\n \n1,953\n \nA summary of the carrying value by investee and by project as of December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nInvestments Expected to be Disposed of\nInvestment to be Held\nNorth East Offshore\nSouth Fork Class B Member, LLC\nSouth Fork Wind Holdings, LLC Class A\nTotal Offshore Wind Investments\n(Millions of Dollars)\nSunrise Wind\nRevolution Wind\nCarrying Value as of December 31, 2023, before \n  Impairment Charge\n$\n699\n \n$\n799\n \n$\n299\n \n$\n485\n \n$\n2,282\n \nFourth Quarter 2023 Impairment Charge\n(\n1,218\n)\n(\n544\n)\n—\n \n(\n4\n)\n(\n1,766\n)\nCarrying Value as of December 31, 2023\n$\n(\n519\n)\n$\n255\n \n$\n299\n \n$\n481\n \n$\n516\n \nDuring 2024, Eversource sold its interest in the North East Offshore and South Fork Class B, Member LLC equity method investments and recognized an aggregate, net after-tax loss on the sale of its offshore wind investments of $\n524\n million.  \nCapital contributions in the offshore wind investments, including the 2023 contribution for the tax equity investment in South Fork Wind, were included in Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates on the statements of cash flows.  Proceeds received from the sale of the investments in 2024, and proceeds received from the 2023 sale of the unused lease area and from an October 2023 distribution of $\n318\n million received primarily as a result of being a \n50\n percent joint owner in the Class B shares of South Fork Wind which was restructured as a tax equity investment, were included in Proceeds from Unconsolidated Affiliates on the statements of cash flows.  \nLiquidation of Renewable Energy Investment Fund:\n  On March 21, 2023, Eversource’s equity method investment in a renewable energy investment fund was liquidated by the fund’s general partner in accordance with the partnership agreement.  Proceeds received from the liquidation totaled $\n147.6\n million and were included in Proceeds from Unconsolidated Affiliates on the statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023.  A portion of the proceeds was used to make a charitable contribution to the Eversource Energy Foundation (a related party) of $\n20.0\n million in 2023.  The liquidation benefit received in excess of the investment’s carrying value and the charitable contribution were included in Other Income, Net on the statement of income. \nNSTAR Electric: \n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, NSTAR Electric's investments included a \n14.5\n percent ownership interest in \ntwo\n companies that transmit hydro-electricity imported from the Hydro-Quebec system in Canada of $\n11.5\n million and $\n9.6\n million, respectively.\n7.     \nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nEversource, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, recognizes a liability for the fair value of an ARO on the obligation date if the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated, even if it is conditional on a future event.  Settlement dates and future costs are reasonably estimated when sufficient information becomes available.  Management has identified various categories of AROs, primarily CYAPC's and YAEC's obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste, and also certain assets containing asbestos and hazardous contamination.  Management has performed fair value calculations reflecting expected probabilities for settlement scenarios.\nThe fair value of an ARO is recorded as a long-term liability with a corresponding amount included in Property, Plant and Equipment, Net on the balance sheets.  The ARO assets are depreciated, and the ARO liabilities are accreted over the estimated life of the obligation and the corresponding credits are recorded as accumulated depreciation and ARO liabilities, respectively.  As the electric and natural gas companies are rate-regulated on a cost-of-service basis, these companies apply regulatory accounting guidance and both the depreciation and accretion costs associated with these companies' AROs are recorded as increases to Regulatory Assets on the balance sheets.  \n107\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending carrying amounts of ARO liabilities is as follows:\n \nAs of December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(Millions of Dollars)\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nBalance as of Beginning of Year\n$\n505.8\n \n$\n39.9\n \n$\n104.8\n \n$\n5.2\n \n$\n502.7\n \n$\n37.4\n \n$\n101.3\n \n$\n4.9\n \nLiabilities Settled During the Year\n(\n24.6\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n24.9\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAccretion\n29.5\n \n2.6\n \n4.5\n \n0.4\n \n29.2\n \n2.5\n \n4.3\n \n0.3\n \nRevisions in Estimated Cash Flows\n80.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1.2\n)\n—\n \n(\n0.8\n)\n—\n \nBalance as of End of Year\n$\n590.9\n \n$\n42.5\n \n$\n109.3\n \n$\n5.6\n \n$\n505.8\n \n$\n39.9\n \n$\n104.8\n \n$\n5.2\n \nEversource's amounts include CYAPC and YAEC's AROs of $\n391.7\n million and $\n315.8\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The fair value of the ARO for CYAPC and YAEC includes uncertainties of the fuel off-load dates related to the DOE's timing of performance regarding its obligation to dispose of the spent nuclear fuel and high level waste and other assumptions, including discount rates.  The incremental asset recorded as an offset to the ARO liability was fully depreciated since the plants have no remaining useful life.  Any changes in the ARO liability are recorded with a corresponding offset to the related regulatory asset.  The assets held in the CYAPC and YAEC spent nuclear fuel trusts are restricted for settling the ARO and all other nuclear fuel storage obligations.  For further information on the assets held in the spent nuclear fuel trusts, see Note 5, \"Marketable Securities,\" to the financial statements.\nThe increase in the ARO balance at Eversource for the year ended December 31, 2024 was due primarily to updated cost estimates that extended the end of life date from 2039 to 2044 for CYAPC and YAEC. These updated cost estimates were approved by FERC in November 2024.\n \n8.     \nSHORT-TERM DEBT\nShort-Term Debt - Borrowing Limits:  \nThe amount of short-term borrowings that may be incurred by CL&P and NSTAR Electric is subject to periodic approval by the FERC.  Because the NHPUC has jurisdiction over PSNH's short-term debt, PSNH is not currently required to obtain FERC approval for its short-term borrowings.  On November 30, 2023, the FERC granted authorization that allows CL&P to issue total short-term borrowings in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $\n600\n million outstanding at any one time, through December 31, 2025.  On December 18, 2023, the FERC granted authorization that allows NSTAR Electric to issue total short-term borrowings in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $\n655\n million outstanding at any one time, through December 31, 2025. \nPSNH is authorized by regulation of the NHPUC to incur short-term borrowings up to \n10\n percent of net fixed plant plus an additional $\n60\n million until further ordered by the NHPUC.  As of December 31, 2024, PSNH's short-term debt authorization under the \n10\n percent of net fixed plant test plus $\n60\n million totaled $\n526.7\n million. \nCL&P's certificate of incorporation contains preferred stock provisions restricting the amount of unsecured debt that CL&P may incur, including limiting unsecured indebtedness with a maturity of less than \n10\n years to \n10\n percent of total capitalization.  As of December 31, 2024, CL&P had $\n901.0\n million\n \nof unsecured debt capacity available under this authorization. \nYankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and EGMA are not required to obtain approval from any state or federal authority to incur short-term debt.\nShort-Term Debt - Commercial Paper Programs and Credit Agreements\n:  Eversource parent has a $\n2.00\n billion commercial paper program allowing Eversource parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt.  Eversource parent, CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas, EGMA and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut are parties to a \nfive-year\n $\n2.00\n billion revolving credit facility, which terminates on October 11, 2029.  This\n re\nvolving credit facility serves to backstop Eversource parent's $\n2.00\n billion commercial paper program.\nNSTAR Electric has a $\n650\n million commercial paper program allowing NSTAR Electric to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt.  NSTAR Electric is also a party to a \nfive-year\n $\n650\n million revolving credit facility, which terminates on October 11, 2029, that serves to backstop NSTAR Electric's $\n650\n million commercial paper program.\nThe amount of borrowings outstanding and available under the commercial paper programs were as follows:\nBorrowings Outstanding\n as of December 31,\nAvailable Borrowing Capacity as of December 31,\nWeighted-Average Interest Rate as of December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nEversource Parent Commercial Paper Program \n$\n1,538.0\n \n$\n1,771.9\n \n$\n462.0\n \n$\n228.1\n \n4.76\n \n%\n5.60\n \n%\nNSTAR Electric Commercial Paper Program \n504.8\n \n365.8\n \n145.2\n \n284.2\n \n4.55\n \n%\n5.40\n \n%\nThere were \nno\n borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nCL&P and PSNH have uncommitted line of credit agreements totaling $\n375\n million and $\n250\n million, respectively, all of which will expire in either May 2025, September 2025 or October 2025.  There are \nno\n borrowings outstanding on either the CL&P or PSNH uncommitted line of credit agreements as of December 31, 2024.\n108\nAmounts outstanding under the commercial paper programs are included in Notes Payable and classified in current liabilities on the Eversource and NSTAR Electric balance sheets, as all borrowings are outstanding for no more than 364 days at one time. \n As a result of the CL&P long-term debt issuance in January 2024, $\n207.3\n million of commercial paper borrowings under the Eversource parent commercial paper program were reclassified to Long-Term Debt on Eversource parent’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.  \nUnder the credit facilities described above, Eversource and its subsidiaries, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, EGMA, Yankee Gas, and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, must comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Eversource and its subsidiaries were in compliance with these covenants.\n \nIf Eversource or its subsidiaries were not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default would occur requiring all outstanding borrowings by such borrower to be repaid, and additional borrowings by such borrower would not be permitted under its respective credit facility.\nIntercompany Borrowings:\n  Eversource parent uses its available capital resources to provide loans to its subsidiaries to assist in meeting their short-term borrowing needs.  Eversource parent records intercompany interest income from its loans to subsidiaries, which is eliminated in consolidation.  Intercompany loans from Eversource parent to its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation on Eversource's balance sheets.  As of December 31, 2024, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to CL&P of $\n280.0\n million and to PSNH of $\n131.1\n million.  As of December 31, 2023, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to CL&P of $\n457.0\n million and to PSNH of $\n233.0\n million.  Eversource parent charges interest on these intercompany loans at the same weighted-average interest rate as its commercial paper program.  Intercompany loans from Eversource parent are included in Notes Payable to Eversource Parent and classified in current liabilities on the respective subsidiary's balance sheets, as these intercompany borrowings are outstanding for no more than 364 days at one time.  \nAs a result of the CL&P long-term debt issuance in January 2024, $\n207.3\n million of CL&P’s intercompany borrowings were reclassified to Long-Term Debt on CL&P’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. \nSources and Uses of Cash\n:  The Company expects the future operating cash flows of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, along with existing borrowing availability and access to both debt and equity markets, will be sufficient to meet any working capital and future operating requirements, and capital investment forecasted opportunities.\n \n9.    \nLONG-TERM DEBT\nDetails of long-term debt outstanding are as follows:\nCL&P\n(Millions of Dollars)\nAs of December 31,\nInterest Rate\n2024\n2023\nFirst Mortgage Bonds:\n \n \n1994 Series D due 2024\n7.875\n \n%\n$\n—\n \n$\n139.8\n \n2004 Series B due 2034\n5.750\n \n%\n130.0\n \n130.0\n \n2005 Series B due 2035\n5.625\n \n%\n100.0\n \n100.0\n \n2006 Series A due 2036\n6.350\n \n%\n250.0\n \n250.0\n \n2007 Series B due 2037\n5.750\n \n%\n150.0\n \n150.0\n \n2007 Series D due 2037\n6.375\n \n%\n100.0\n \n100.0\n \n2014 Series A due 2044  \n4.300\n \n%\n475.0\n \n475.0\n \n2015 Series A due 2045\n4.150\n \n%\n350.0\n \n350.0\n \n   2017 Series A due 2027\n3.200\n \n%\n500.0\n \n500.0\n \n2018 Series A due 2048\n4.000\n \n%\n800.0\n \n800.0\n \n2020 Series A due 2025\n0.750\n \n%\n400.0\n \n400.0\n \n2021 Series A due 2031\n2.050\n \n%\n425.0\n \n425.0\n \n2023 Series A due 2053\n5.250\n \n%\n500.0\n \n500.0\n \n2023 Series B due 2033\n4.900\n \n%\n300.0\n \n300.0\n \n2024 Series A due 2029\n4.650\n \n%\n350.0\n \n—\n \n2024 Series B due 2034\n4.950\n \n%\n300.0\n \n—\n \nTotal First Mortgage Bonds\n5,130.0\n \n4,619.8\n \nLess Amounts due Within One Year\n(\n400.0\n)\n(\n139.8\n)\nCurrent Portion Classified as Long-Term Debt \n(1)\n397.1\n \n139.8\n \nCommercial Paper Classified as Long-Term Debt (See Note 8, Short-Term Debt)\n—\n \n207.3\n \nUnamortized Premiums and Discounts, Net\n14.3\n \n18.0\n \nUnamortized Debt Issuance Costs\n(\n33.2\n)\n(\n30.7\n)\nCL&P Long-Term Debt\n$\n5,108.2\n \n$\n4,814.4\n \n109\nNSTAR Electric\n(Millions of Dollars)\nAs of December 31,\nInterest Rate\n2024\n2023\nDebentures:\n \n \n2006 Debentures due 2036\n5.750\n \n%\n$\n200.0\n \n$\n200.0\n \n2010 Debentures due 2040\n5.500\n \n%\n300.0\n \n300.0\n \n2014 Debentures due 2044  \n4.400\n \n%\n300.0\n \n300.0\n \n2015 Debentures due 2025\n3.250\n \n%\n250.0\n \n250.0\n \n2016 Debentures due 2026\n2.700\n \n%\n250.0\n \n250.0\n \n2017 Debentures due 2027\n3.200\n \n%\n700.0\n \n700.0\n \n2019 Debentures due 2029\n3.250\n \n%\n400.0\n \n400.0\n \n2020 Debentures due 2030\n3.950\n \n%\n400.0\n \n400.0\n \n2021 Debentures due 2051\n3.100\n \n%\n300.0\n \n300.0\n \n2021 Debentures due 2031\n1.950\n \n%\n300.0\n \n300.0\n \n2022 Debentures due 2052\n4.550\n \n%\n450.0\n \n450.0\n \n2022 Debentures due 2052\n4.950\n \n%\n400.0\n \n400.0\n \n2023 Debentures due 2028\n5.600\n \n%\n150.0\n \n150.0\n \n2024 Debentures due 2034\n5.400\n \n%\n600.0\n \n—\n \nTotal Debentures\n5,000.0\n \n4,400.0\n \nNotes:\n \n \n2004 Senior Notes Series B due 2034\n5.900\n \n%\n50.0\n \n50.0\n \n2007 Senior Notes Series D due 2037\n6.700\n \n%\n40.0\n \n40.0\n \n2016 Senior Notes Series H due 2026\n2.750\n \n%\n50.0\n \n50.0\n \nTotal Notes\n140.0\n \n140.0\n \nLess Amounts due Within One Year\n(\n250.0\n)\n—\n \nUnamortized Premiums and Discounts, Net\n(\n14.0\n)\n(\n14.0\n)\nUnamortized Debt Issuance Costs\n(\n31.1\n)\n(\n29.1\n)\nNSTAR Electric Long-Term Debt\n$\n4,844.9\n \n$\n4,496.9\n \nPSNH\n(Millions of Dollars)\nAs of December 31,\nInterest Rate\n2024\n2023\nFirst Mortgage Bonds:\n \n \n2005 Series M due 2035\n5.600\n \n%\n$\n50.0\n \n$\n50.0\n \n2019 Series T due 2049  \n3.600\n \n%\n300.0\n \n300.0\n \n2020 Series U due 2050\n2.400\n \n%\n150.0\n \n150.0\n \n2021 Series V due 2031\n2.200\n \n%\n350.0\n \n350.0\n \n2023 Series W due 2053\n5.150\n \n%\n300.0\n \n300.0\n \n2023 Series X due 2033\n5.350\n \n%\n600.0\n \n300.0\n \nTotal First Mortgage Bonds\n1,750.0\n \n1,450.0\n \nUnamortized Premiums and Discounts, Net\n(\n2.6\n)\n(\n4.9\n)\nUnamortized Debt Issuance Costs\n(\n15.3\n)\n(\n13.5\n)\nPSNH Long-Term Debt\n$\n1,732.1\n \n$\n1,431.6\n \n110\nOTHER\n(Millions of Dollars)\nAs of December 31,\nInterest Rate\n2024\n2023\nEversource Parent -

Additionally, the long-term debt agreements provide that Eversource and certain of its subsidiaries must comply with certain covenants as are customarily included in such agreements, including equity requirements for NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and Aquarion.  Under the equity requirements, NSTAR Electric's and Aquarion's senior notes must maintain a certain consolidated indebtedness to capitalization ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter and NSTAR Gas' outstanding long-term debt must not exceed equity. \nCertain secured and unsecured long-term debt securities are callable at redemption price or are subject to make-whole provisions. \nNo long-term debt defaults have occurred as of December 31, 2024. \n112\nCYAPC's Pre-1983 Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligation:\n  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is responsible for the selection and development of repositories for, and the disposal of, spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  CYAPC is obligated to pay the DOE for the costs to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste generated prior to April 7, 1983 (pre-1983 Spent Nuclear Fuel).  CYAPC has partially paid this obligation and recorded an accrual for its remaining liability to the DOE.  This liability accrues interest costs at the 3-month Treasury bill yield rate.  For nuclear fuel used to generate electricity prior to April 7, 1983, payment may be made any time prior to the first delivery of spent fuel to the DOE.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as a result of consolidating CYAPC, Eversource has consolidated $\n5.6\n million and $\n12.5\n million, respectively, in pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligations to the DOE.  The obligation includes accumulated interest costs of $\n4.3\n million and $\n9.5\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  CYAPC maintains a trust to fund amounts due to the DOE for the disposal of pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel.  For further information, see Note 5, \"Marketable Securities,\" to the financial statements.  Fees for disposal of nuclear fuel burned on or after April 7, 1983 were billed to member companies and paid to the DOE. \nLong-Term Debt Maturities:  \nLong-term debt maturities on debt outstanding for the years 2025 through 2029 and thereafter are shown below.  These amounts exclude PSNH rate reduction bonds, CYAPC pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation, and unamortized premiums, discounts, and debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2024:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\n2025\n$\n1,400.3\n \n$\n400.0\n \n$\n250.0\n \n$\n—\n \n2026\n1,390.2\n \n—\n \n300.0\n \n—\n \n2027\n2,889.2\n \n500.0\n \n700.0\n \n—\n \n2028\n1,978.5\n \n—\n \n150.0\n \n—\n \n2029\n2,300.3\n \n350.0\n \n400.0\n \n—\n \nThereafter\n16,857.0\n \n3,880.0\n \n3,340.0\n \n1,750.0\n \nTotal\n$\n26,815.5\n \n$\n5,130.0\n \n$\n5,140.0\n \n$\n1,750.0\n \n10.    \nRATE REDUCTION BONDS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nRate Reduction Bonds:  \nIn May 2018, PSNH Funding, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSNH, issued $\n635.7\n million of securitized RRBs in multiple tranches with a weighted average interest rate of \n3.66\n percent, and final maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2035.  The RRBs are expected to be repaid by February 1, 2033.  RRB payments consist of principal and interest and are paid semi-annually, beginning on February 1, 2019.  The RRBs were issued pursuant to a finance order\n \nissued by the NHPUC in January 2018 to recover remaining costs resulting from the divestiture of PSNH’s generation assets.  \nThe proceeds were used by PSNH Funding to purchase PSNH’s stranded cost asset-recovery property, including its vested property right to bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable stranded cost recovery charge from PSNH’s retail customers.  The collections are used to pay principal, interest and other costs in connection with the RRBs.  The RRBs are secured by the stranded cost asset-recovery property.  Cash collections from the stranded cost recovery charges and funds on deposit in trust accounts are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation.  PSNH is not the owner of the RRBs, and PSNH Funding’s assets and revenues are not available to pay PSNH’s creditors.  The RRBs are non-recourse senior secured obligations of PSNH Funding and are not insured or guaranteed by PSNH or Eversource Energy. \nPSNH Funding was formed solely to issue RRBs to finance PSNH's unrecovered remaining costs associated with the divestiture of its generation assets.  PSNH Funding is considered a VIE primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. PSNH has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE and is most closely associated with the VIE as compared to other interest holders.  Therefore, PSNH is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates PSNH Funding in its consolidated financial statements.\nThe following tables summarize the impact of PSNH Funding on PSNH's balance sheets and income statements:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nAs of December 31,\nPSNH Balance Sheets:\n2024\n2023\nRestricted Cash - Current Portion (included in Special Deposits)\n$\n31.0\n \n$\n30.0\n \nRestricted Cash - Long-Term Portion (included in Other Long-Term Assets)\n3.1\n \n3.2\n \nSecuritized Stranded Cost (included in Regulatory Assets)\n349.3\n \n392.5\n \nOther Regulatory Liabilities (included in Regulatory Liabilities)\n6.9\n \n5.3\n \nAccrued Interest (included in Other Current Liabilities)\n5.7\n \n6.3\n \nRate Reduction Bonds - Current Portion\n43.2\n \n43.2\n \nRate Reduction Bonds - Long-Term Portion\n324.1\n \n367.3\n \n(Millions of Dollars)\nPSNH\n \nIncome Statements:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmortization of RRB Principal (included in Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net)\n$\n43.2\n \n$\n43.2\n \n$\n43.2\n \nInterest Expense on RRB Principal (included in Interest Expense)\n14.3\n \n15.7\n \n17.0\n \n113\nEstimated principal payments on RRBs as of December 31, 2024, is summarized annually through 2029 and thereafter as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\nPSNH\n$\n43.2\n \n$\n43.2\n \n$\n43.2\n \n$\n43.2\n \n$\n43.2\n \n$\n151.3\n \n$\n367.3\n \nVariable Interest Entities - Other:\n  The Company's variable interests outside of the consolidated group include contracts that are required by regulation and provide for regulatory recovery of contract costs and benefits through customer rates.  Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric hold variable interests in VIEs through agreements with certain entities that own single renewable energy or peaking generation power plants, with other independent power producers and with transmission businesses.  Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric do not control the activities that are economically significant to these VIEs or provide financial or other support to these VIEs.  Therefore, Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric do not consolidate these VIEs.\n11.     \nEMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nA.     Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension\nEversource provides defined benefit retirement plans (Pension Plans) that cover eligible employees and are subject to the provisions of ERISA, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.  Eversource's policy is to annually fund the Pension Plans in an amount at least equal to an amount that will satisfy all federal funding requirements.  In addition to the Pension Plans, Eversource maintains non-qualified defined benefit retirement plans (SERP Plans), which provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations to eligible participants consisting of current and retired employees. \nEversource also provides defined benefit postretirement plans (PBOP Plans) that provide life insurance and a health reimbursement arrangement created for the purpose of reimbursing retirees and dependents for health insurance premiums and certain medical expenses to eligible employees that meet certain age and service eligibility requirements.  The benefits provided under the PBOP Plans are not vested, and the Company has the right to modify any benefit provision subject to applicable laws at that time.  Eversource annually funds postretirement costs through tax deductible contributions to external trusts. \nIn August 2024, Eversource communicated to its employees participating in the Eversource 401k Plan enhanced defined contribution feature (referred to as K-Vantage) that effective January 1, 2025, a Cash Balance Pension Plan is established, which replaces employer K-Vantage contributions.  Eversource transferred into the Cash Balance Pension Plan employees who are participants in the K-Vantage plan, with the exception of one union group with ongoing negotiations, and will credit employees a set percentage of an employee’s eligible pay based on age and years of service on the employee’s behalf.  This benefit is a new, additional obligation of the existing Pension Plan and will be funded through the existing assets of the Eversource Pension Plan.

For the Aquarion PBOP Plan, the health care cost trend rate for pre-65 retirees is \n7.5\n percent, with an ultimate rate of \n5\n percent in 2035, and for post-65 retirees, the health care trend rate and ultimate rate is \n3.5\n percent.\n116\nExpense:  \nEversource charges net periodic benefit plan expense/(income) for the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans to its subsidiaries based on the actual participant demographic data for each subsidiary's participants.  The actual investment return in the trust is allocated to each of the subsidiaries annually in proportion to the investment return expected to be earned during the year.  The Company utilizes the spot rate methodology to estimate the discount rate for the service and interest cost components of benefit plan expense, which provides a relatively precise measurement by matching projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.\nThe components of net periodic benefit plan expense/(income) for the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans, prior to amounts capitalized as Property, Plant and Equipment or deferred as regulatory assets/(liabilities) for future recovery or refund, are shown below.  The service cost component of net periodic benefit plan expense/(income), less the capitalized portion, is included in Operations and Maintenance expense on the statements of income.  The remaining components of net periodic benefit plan expense/(income), less the deferred portion, are included in Other Income, Net on the statements of income.

The regulated companies record actuarial losses and gains and prior service costs and credits arising at the December 31st remeasurement date of the funded status of the benefit plans as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability in lieu of a charge to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss), reflecting ultimate recovery from customers through rates.  Regulatory accounting is also applied to the portions of the Eversource Service retiree benefit costs that support the regulated companies, as these costs are also recovered from customers.  Adjustments to the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans' funded status for the unregulated companies are recorded on an after-tax basis to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss).  For further information, see Note 2, \"Regulatory Accounting,\" and Note 16, \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss),\" to the financial statements.  \nThe difference between the actual return and calculated expected return on plan assets for the Pension and PBOP Plans, as well as changes in actuarial assumptions impacting the projected benefit obligation, are recorded as unamortized actuarial gains or losses arising during the year in Regulatory Assets or Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss).  Unamortized actuarial gains or losses are amortized as a component of pension and PBOP expense over the estimated average future employee service period using the corridor approach.\nThe following is a summary of the changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in Regulatory Assets and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) as well as amounts in Regulatory Assets and OCI that were reclassified as net periodic benefit expense during the years presented:\nPension and SERP\nPBOP\n \nRegulatory Assets\nOCI\nRegulatory Assets\nOCI\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nActuarial (Gain)/Loss Arising During the Year\n$\n(\n49.2\n)\n$\n251.1\n \n$\n2.3\n \n$\n14.0\n \n$\n(\n50.9\n)\n$\n(\n32.0\n)\n$\n(\n0.6\n)\n$\n(\n0.3\n)\nActuarial (Loss)/Gain Reclassified as Net Periodic Benefit (Expense)/Income\n(\n79.1\n)\n(\n38.8\n)\n(\n6.8\n)\n(\n7.0\n)\n0.4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nActuarial (Loss)/Gain Reclassified as Held for Sale\n(\n16.6\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n7.1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nSettlement Loss\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n4.3\n)\n(\n12.4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPrior Service Cost/(Credit) Arising During the Year\n1.3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.9\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nPrior Service (Cost)/Credit Reclassified as Net Periodic\n  Benefit (Expense)/Income\n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\n21.8\n \n21.8\n \n(\n0.2\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\nPrior Service Cost Reclassified as Held for Sale\n(\n1.2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.6\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nThe following is a summary of the remaining Regulatory Assets and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income amounts that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit expense as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nRegulatory Assets as of December 31,\nAOCI as of December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nPension and SERP\nActuarial Loss\n$\n956.1\n \n$\n1,101.0\n \n$\n47.7\n \n$\n56.5\n \nPrior Service Cost\n1.8\n \n2.9\n \n0.2\n \n0.3\n \nPBOP\nActuarial Loss\n$\n6.4\n \n$\n49.8\n \n$\n1.8\n \n$\n2.4\n \nPrior Service (Credit)/Cost\n(\n66.2\n)\n(\n87.4\n)\n0.5\n \n0.7\n \nEstimated Future Benefit Payments:  \nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid by the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans:\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030 - 2034\nPension and SERP\n$\n367.3\n \n$\n363.3\n \n$\n369.5\n \n$\n372.9\n \n$\n375.4\n \n$\n1,879.4\n \nPBOP\n51.3\n \n50.6\n \n49.8\n \n48.9\n \n48.0\n \n223.3\n \nEversource Contributions:\n  Based on the current status of the Pension Plans and federal pension funding requirements, for our Eversource Service Pension Plan there is no minimum funding requirement in 2025 and we do not expect to make pension contributions in 2025.  We do not expect to make any contributions to the Eversource Service PBOP Plan in 2025.  Eversource contributed $\n5.0\n million and $\n0.9\n million to the Aquarion Pension and PBOP Plans, respectively, in 2024.\nFair Value of Pension and PBOP Plan Assets:\n  Pension and PBOP funds are held in external trusts.  Trust assets, including accumulated earnings, must be used exclusively for Pension and PBOP payments.  Eversource's investment strategy for its Pension and PBOP Plans is to maximize the long-term rates of return on these plans' assets within an acceptable level of risk.  The investment guidelines for each asset category includes a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers and it establishes target asset allocations that are routinely reviewed and periodically rebalanced.  PBOP assets are comprised of assets held in the PBOP Plan trust, as well as specific assets within the Pension Plan trust (401(h) assets).  The investment policy and strategy of the 401(h) assets is consistent with that of the defined benefit pension plan.  Eversource's expected long-term rates of return on Pension and PBOP Plan assets are based on target asset allocation assumptions and related expected long-\n118\nterm rates of return.  In developing its expected long-term rate of return assumptions for the Pension and PBOP Plans, Eversource evaluated input from consultants, as well as long-term inflation assumptions and historical returns. Management has assumed long-term rates of return of \n8.25\n percent for the Eversource Service Pension Plan assets, the Eversource Service PBOP Plan assets and the Aquarion Pension Plan assets, and a 7 percent long-term rate of return for the Aquarion PBOP Plan, to estimate its 2025 Pension and PBOP costs. \nThese long-term rates of return are based on the assumed rates of return for the target asset allocations as follows:\n \nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n \nTarget Asset Allocation\nAssumed Rate of Return\nTarget Asset Allocation\nAssumed Rate of Return\n \nEversource Pension Plan \nEversource PBOP Plan\nEversource Pension Plan and PBOP Plan\nEversource Pension Plan\nEversource PBOP Plan\nEversource Pension Plan and PBOP Plan\nEquity Securities:\n \n \nUnited States\n—\n \n%\n20.0\n \n%\n8.5\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n20.0\n \n%\n8.5\n \n%\nGlobal\n20.0\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n8.8\n \n%\n20.0\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n8.75\n \n%\nNon-United States\n—\n \n%\n11.0\n \n%\n8.5\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n11.0\n \n%\n8.5\n \n%\nEmerging Markets\n—\n \n%\n6.0\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n6.0\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\nDebt Securities:\nFixed Income\n16.0\n \n%\n17.0\n \n%\n5.5\n \n%\n16.0\n \n%\n17.0\n \n%\n5.5\n \n%\nPublic High Yield Fixed Income\n5.0\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n7.5\n \n%\n5.0\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n7.5\n \n%\nUnited States Treasuries\n11.0\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n4.5\n \n%\n11.0\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n4.5\n \n%\nPrivate Debt\n10.0\n \n%\n13.0\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\n13.0\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\nPrivate Equity\n23.0\n \n%\n18.0\n \n%\n12.0\n \n%\n23.0\n \n%\n18.0\n \n%\n12.0\n \n%\nReal Assets\n15.0\n \n%\n15.0\n \n%\n7.5\n \n%\n15.0\n \n%\n15.0\n \n%\n7.5\n \n%\nThe following tables present, by asset category, the Pension and PBOP Plan assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis by the level in which they are classified within the fair value hierarchy:  \n \n \nPension Plan\n \n \nFair Value Measurements as of December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024 \n(1)\n2023\n (2)\nAsset Category:\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nUncategorized\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nUncategorized\nTotal\nEquity Securities\n$\n323.6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n826.0\n \n$\n1,149.6\n \n$\n374.0\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n853.0\n \n$\n1,227.0\n \nFixed Income\n314.3\n \n344.7\n \n1,329.6\n \n1,988.6\n \n354.6\n \n340.9\n \n1,516.4\n \n2,211.9\n \nPrivate Equity  \n—\n \n—\n \n1,710.9\n \n1,710.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,685.3\n \n1,685.3\n \nReal Assets\n243.8\n \n—\n \n652.2\n \n896.0\n \n173.6\n \n—\n \n722.1\n \n895.7\n \nTotal\n$\n881.7\n \n$\n344.7\n \n$\n4,518.7\n \n$\n5,745.1\n \n$\n902.2\n \n$\n340.9\n \n$\n4,776.8\n \n$\n6,019.9\n \nLess:  401(h) PBOP Assets\n (3)\n \n \n(\n231.1\n)\n \n \n(\n244.9\n)\nTotal Pension Assets\n \n \n$\n5,514.0\n \n \n \n$\n5,775.0\n \n  \nPBOP Plan\n \n \nFair Value Measurements as of December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n (1)\n2023\nAsset Category:\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nUncategorized\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nUncategorized\nTotal\nEquity Securities\n$\n184.8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n166.3\n \n$\n351.1\n \n$\n139.1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n212.1\n \n$\n351.2\n \nFixed Income\n61.8\n \n44.6\n \n127.5\n \n233.9\n \n33.4\n \n43.0\n \n159.8\n \n236.2\n \nPrivate Equity\n—\n \n—\n \n99.0\n \n99.0\n \n—\n \n—\n \n87.7\n \n87.7\n \nReal Assets\n83.7\n \n—\n \n37.5\n \n121.2\n \n70.5\n \n—\n \n33.9\n \n104.4\n \nTotal\n$\n330.3\n \n$\n44.6\n \n$\n430.3\n \n$\n805.2\n \n$\n243.0\n \n$\n43.0\n \n$\n493.5\n \n$\n779.5\n \nAdd:  401(h) PBOP Assets\n (3)\n \n \n231.1\n \n \n \n244.9\n \nTotal PBOP Assets\n \n \n$\n1,036.3\n \n \n \n$\n1,024.4\n \n(1) \n    \nAs of December 31, 2024, the funded status of the Aquarion water distribution business’s Pension and PBOP benefit plans have been reclassified in held for sale presentation on the Eversource balance sheet.

Swaps are valued using pricing models that incorporate interest rates and equity and fixed income index closing prices to determine a net present value of the cash flows.  \nCertain investments, such as commingled funds, private equity investments, fixed income funds, real asset funds and hedge funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient.  Assets valued at NAV are uncategorized in the fair value hierarchy. These investments are structured as investment companies offering shares or units to multiple investors for the purpose of providing a return.  Commingled funds are recorded at NAV provided by the asset manager, which is based on the market prices of the underlying equity securities.  Private Equity investments, Fixed Income partnership funds and Real Assets are valued using the NAV provided by the partnerships, which are based on discounted cash flows of the underlying investments, real estate appraisals or public market comparables of the underlying investments, or the NAV of underlying assets held in hedge funds.  Equity Securities investments in United States, Global, Non-United States and Emerging Markets that are uncategorized include investments in commingled funds and hedge funds that are overlaid with equity index swaps and futures contracts.  Fixed Income investments that are uncategorized include investments in commingled funds, fixed income funds that invest in a variety of opportunistic credit and private debt strategies, and hedge funds that are overlaid with fixed income futures.  \nB.     \nDefined Contribution Plans\nEversource maintains defined contribution plans on behalf of eligible participants.  The Eversource 401k Plan provides for employee and employer contributions up to statutory limits.  For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, for eligible employees, the Eversource 401k Plan provided employer matching contributions of either \n100\n percent up to a maximum of \nthree\n percent of eligible compensation or \n50\n percent up to a maximum of \neight\n percent of eligible compensation.  The Eversource 401k Plan also contained a K-Vantage feature for the benefit of eligible participants, which provided an additional annual employer contribution based on age and years of service.  K-Vantage participants were not eligible to actively participate in the Eversource Pension Plan.\nThe total Eversource 401k Plan employer matching contributions, including the K-Vantage contributions, were as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\n2024\n$\n76.2\n \n$\n10.6\n \n$\n15.4\n \n$\n6.0\n \n2023\n67.3\n \n9.0\n \n13.7\n \n5.4\n \n2022\n59.9\n \n7.7\n \n12.8\n \n4.8\n \nEffective January 1, 2025 for eligible Plan participants, the Eversource 401k Plan began providing employer matching contributions of 100 percent up to a maximum of six percent of eligible compensation.  Also effective January 1, 2025, Eversource replaced employer K-Vantage contributions with the Cash Balance Pension Plan.  See Note 11A, \"Employee Benefits – Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension,\" for further information.\nC.    \nShare-Based Payments\nShare-based compensation awards are recorded using a fair-value based method at the date of grant.  Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH record compensation expense related to these awards, as applicable, for shares issued to their respective employees and officers, as well as for the allocation of costs associated with shares issued to Eversource's service company employees and officers that support CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.  \nEversource Incentive Plans:\n  Eversource maintains long-term equity-based incentive plans in which Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH employees, officers and board members are eligible to participate.  The incentive plans authorize Eversource to grant up to \n7,400,000\n \nnew shares for various types of awards, including RSUs and performance shares, to eligible employees, officers, and board members.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Eversource had \n3,790,353\n and \n4,587,376\n common shares, respectively, available for issuance under these plans.\nEversource accounts for its various share-based plans as follows:\n•\nRSUs - Eversource records compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based upon the fair value of Eversource's common shares at the date of grant.  The par value of RSUs is reclassified to Common Stock from Capital Surplus, Paid In as RSUs become issued as common shares.\n•\nPerformance Shares - Eversource records compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Performance shares vest based upon the extent to which Company goals are achieved.  Vesting of outstanding performance shares is based upon the Company's EPS growth over the requisite service period and level of payout is determined based on the total shareholder return as compared to the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Index during the requisite service period.  The fair value of performance shares is determined at the date of grant using a lattice model.  Compensation expense is subject to volatility until payout is established.\n120\nRSUs:\n  Eversource granted RSUs under the annual long-term incentive programs that are subject to \nthree-year\n graded vesting schedules for employees, and \none-year\n graded vesting schedules, or immediate vesting, for board members.  RSUs are paid in shares, reduced by amounts sufficient to satisfy withholdings for income taxes, subsequent to vesting.  \nA summary of RSU transactions is as follows: \nRSUs\n(Units)\nWeighted Average\nGrant-Date Fair Value\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023\n672,242\n \n$\n65.89\n \nGranted\n372,400\n \n$\n57.93\n \nShares Issued\n(\n289,372\n)\n$\n65.25\n \nForfeited\n(\n39,828\n)\n$\n66.91\n \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2024\n715,442\n \n$\n61.95\n \nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n57.93\n, $\n76.42\n and $\n85.96\n, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the number and weighted average grant-date fair value of unvested RSUs was \n455,620\n and $\n65.29\n per share, and \n326,581\n and $\n80.76\n per share, respectively.  During 2024, there were \n280,938\n RSUs at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $\n65.20\n per share that vested during the year and were either paid or deferred.  As of December 31, 2024, \n259,822\n RSUs were fully vested and deferred and an additional \n432,839\n are expected to vest.   \nPerformance Shares:\n  Eversource granted performance shares under the annual long-term incentive programs that vest based upon the extent to which Company goals are achieved at the end of three-year performance measurement periods.  Performance shares are paid in shares, after the performance measurement period.  \nA summary of performance share transactions is as follows:\nPerformance Shares\n(Units)\nWeighted Average\nGrant-Date Fair Value\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023\n664,424\n \n$\n85.33\n \nGranted\n431,789\n \n$\n55.87\n \nShares Issued\n(\n126,054\n)\n$\n85.54\n \nForfeited\n(\n105,967\n)\n$\n77.98\n \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2024\n864,192\n \n$\n71.48\n \nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of performance shares granted for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n55.87\n, $\n83.39\n and $\n83.34\n, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the number and weighted average grant-date fair value of unvested performance shares was \n737,738\n and $\n69.12\n per share, and \n485,480\n and $\n85.20\n per share, respectively.  During 2024, there were \n72,723\n performance shares at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $\n84.87\n per share that vested during the year and were either paid or deferred.  As of December 31, 2024, \n126,454\n performance shares were fully vested and deferred.\nCompensation Expense:\n \nThe total compensation expense and associated future income tax benefits recognized by Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH for share-based compensation awards were as follows:\nEversource\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCompensation Expense\n$\n30.0\n \n$\n27.8\n \n$\n33.4\n \nFuture Income Tax Benefit\n7.8\n \n7.3\n \n8.7\n \n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCompensation Expense\n$\n9.3\n \n$\n9.6\n \n$\n3.6\n \n$\n8.7\n \n$\n8.7\n \n$\n3.0\n \n$\n10.0\n \n$\n10.7\n \n$\n3.6\n \nFuture Income Tax Benefit\n2.4\n \n2.5\n \n0.9\n \n2.3\n \n2.3\n \n0.8\n \n2.6\n \n2.8\n \n0.9\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $\n31.2\n million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested share-based awards for Eversource, including $\n5.5\n million for CL&P, $\n8.8\n million for NSTAR Electric, and $\n2.0\n million for PSNH.  This cost is expected to be recognized ratably over a weighted-average period of \n1.76\n years for Eversource, CL&P, and PSNH and \n1.77\n years for NSTAR Electric.\nAn income tax rate of \n26\n percent was used to estimate the tax effect on total share-based payments determined under the fair-value based method for all awards.  The Company issues treasury shares to settle fully vested RSUs and performance shares under the Company's incentive plans.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, a tax deficiency associated with the distribution of stock compensation awards increased income tax expense by $\n2.3\n million and $\n0.5\n million, respectively, which decreased cash flows from operating activities on the statements of cash flows.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, excess tax benefits associated with the distribution of stock compensation awards reduced income tax expense by $\n2.1\n million, which increased cash flows from operating activities on the statements of cash flows.\n121\nD.     \nOther Retirement Benefits\nEversource provides retirement and other benefits for certain current and past company officers.  These benefits are accounted for on an accrual basis and expensed over a period equal to the service lives of the employees.  The actuarially-determined liability for these benefits is included in Other Current and Long-Term Liabilities on the balance sheets.  The related expense, which includes the allocation of expense associated with Eversource's service company officers that support CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, is included in Operations and Maintenance Expense on the income statements.  \nThe liability and expense amounts are as follows:\nEversource\n(Millions of Dollars)\nAs of and For the Years Ended December

component of Other Interest Expense on the statements of income.  However, when resolution of uncertainties results in the Company receiving interest income, any related interest benefit is recorded in Other Income, Net on the statements of income.  No penalties have been recorded.  The amount of interest expense recognized on uncertain tax positions was $\n1.3\n million and $\n0.3\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  There was \nno\n interest expense/(income) recognized on uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2022.  Accrued interest payable was $\n1.7\n million and $\n0.4\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nTax Positions:\n  During 2024 and 2023, Eversource did not resolve any of its uncertain tax positions.\nOpen Tax Years:  \nThe following table summarizes Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, and PSNH's tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of December 31, 2024:\nDescription\nTax Years\nFederal\n   2022 - 2024\n(1)\nConnecticut\n2021 - 2024\nMassachusetts\n2022 - 2024\nNew Hampshire\n2021 - 2024\n(1)     \nThe Company’s Corporate Income Tax Returns for 2022 and 2023 were reviewed and closed as part of the annual IRS CAP program, with the exception for partnership investments of the Company. The Company was recently informed of an IRS audit of one of the partnership returns for the tax year 2022 and the IRS reserves the right to audit 2023. The Company recorded in the above Unrecognized Tax Benefits a reserve associated with this Partnership audit.  These years remain open in relation to those audits.\nEversource does not estimate to have an earnings impact related to unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.\n13.     \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nA.     Environmental Matters\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are subject to environmental laws and regulations intended to mitigate or remove the effect of past operations and improve or maintain the quality of the environment.  These laws and regulations require the removal or the remedy of the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of certain specified hazardous substances at current and former operating sites.  Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH have an active environmental auditing and training program and each believes it is substantially in compliance with all enacted laws and regulations.\nEnvironmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated.  The approach used estimates the liability based on the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options, including no action required or several different remedies ranging from establishing institutional controls to full site remediation and monitoring.  These liabilities are estimated on an undiscounted basis and do not assume that the amounts are recoverable from insurance companies or other third parties.  The environmental reserves include sites at different stages of discovery and remediation and do not include any unasserted claims.\n125\nThese reserve estimates are subjective in nature as they take into consideration several different remediation options at each specific site.  The reliability and precision of these estimates can be affected by several factors, including new information concerning either the level of contamination at the site, the extent of Eversource's, CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's and PSNH's responsibility for remediation or the extent of remediation required, recently enacted laws and regulations or changes in cost estimates due to certain economic factors.  It is possible that new information or future developments could require a reassessment of the potential exposure to required environmental remediation.  As this information becomes available, management will continue to assess the potential exposure and adjust the reserves accordingly.  \nThe amounts recorded as environmental reserves are included in Other Current Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities on the balance sheets and represent management's best estimate of the liability for environmental costs, and take into consideration site assessment, remediation and long-term monitoring costs.  The environmental reserves also take into account recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and pollutants, mandated expenditures to remediate contaminated sites and any other infrequent and non-recurring clean-up costs.  \nA reconciliation of the activity in the \nenvironmental reserves\n is as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\nBalance as of January 1, 2023\n$\n122.6\n \n$\n13.9\n \n$\n3.4\n \n$\n6.1\n \nAdditions\n16.8\n \n2.6\n \n2.5\n \n1.7\n \nPayments/Reductions\n(\n11.2\n)\n(\n2.7\n)\n(\n0.5\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n128.2\n \n13.8\n \n5.4\n \n7.6\n \nAdditions\n11.0\n \n0.8\n \n1.9\n \n0.2\n \nPayments/Reductions\n(\n11.2\n)\n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n0.7\n)\n(\n1.5\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n128.0\n \n$\n13.4\n \n$\n6.6\n \n$\n6.3\n \nThe number of environmental sites for which remediation or long-term monitoring, preliminary site work or site assessment is being performed are as follows:\nEversource\nCL&P\nNSTAR Electric\nPSNH\n2024\n65\n15\n14\n8\n2023\n65\n16\n12\n8\nIncluded in the number of sites and reserve amounts above are former MGP sites that were operated several decades ago and manufactured natural gas from coal and other processes, which resulted in certain by-products remaining in the environment that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment, for which Eversource may have potential liability.  The reserve balances related to these former MGP sites were $\n115.9\n million and $\n117.1\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and related primarily to the natural gas business segment.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, for \n17\n environmental sites (\n9\n for CL&P and \n2\n for NSTAR Electric) that are included in the Company's reserve for environmental costs, management cannot reasonably estimate the exposure to loss in excess of the reserve, or range of loss, as these sites are under investigation and/or there is significant uncertainty as to what remedial actions, if any, the Company may be required to undertake.  As of December 31, 2024, $\n30.7\n million (including $\n5.7\n million for CL&P and $\n1.4\n million for NSTAR Electric) had been accrued as a liability for these sites. \nAs of December 31, 2024, for \n8\n environmental sites (1 for NSTAR Electric) that are included in the Company's reserve for environmental costs, the information known and the nature of the remediation options allow for the Company to estimate the range of losses for environmental costs.  As of December 31, 2024, $\n29.5\n million has been accrued as a liability for these sites, which represents the low end of the range of the liabilities for environmental costs.  Management believes that additional losses of up to approximately $\n17.5\n million may be incurred in executing current remediation plans for these sites.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, for the remaining \n40\n environmental sites (including \n6\n for CL&P, \n11\n for NSTAR Electric and \n8\n for PSNH) that are included in the Company's reserve for environmental costs, the $\n67.8\n million accrual (including $\n7.7\n million for CL&P, $\n5.2\n million for NSTAR Electric and $\n6.3\n million for PSNH) represents management's best estimate of the probable liability and no additional loss is estimable at this time. \nPSNH, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas have rate recovery mechanisms for MGP related environmental costs, therefore, changes in their respective environmental reserves do not impact Net Income.  CL&P is allowed to defer certain environmental costs for future recovery.  NSTAR Electric does not have a separate environmental cost recovery regulatory mechanism.\n \n126\nB.     \nLong-Term Contractual Arrangements\nEstimated Future Annual Costs:  \nThe estimated future annual costs of significant executed, non-cancelable, long-term contractual arrangements in effect as of December 31, 2024 are as follows: \nEversource\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\nRenewable Energy Purchase Contracts\n$\n771.8\n \n$\n865.2\n \n$\n919.9\n \n$\n918.0\n \n$\n785.5\n \n$\n6,289.9\n \n$\n10,550.3\n \nNatural Gas Procurement\n532.6\n \n486.1\n \n364.6\n \n308.1\n \n294.9\n \n1,004.4\n \n2,990.7\n \nCapacity and Purchased Power\n75.2\n \n2.9\n \n2.7\n \n2.7\n \n2.3\n \n2.3\n \n88.1\n \nPeaker CfDs\n28.3\n \n27.7\n \n23.1\n \n23.3\n \n24.1\n \n84.6\n \n211.1\n \nTransmission Support Commitments\n17.1\n \n18.8\n \n20.0\n \n20.9\n \n21.8\n \n22.6\n \n121.2\n \nTotal\n$\n1,425.0\n \n$\n1,400.7\n \n$\n1,330.3\n \n$\n1,273.0\n \n$\n1,128.6\n \n$\n7,403.8\n \n$\n13,961.4\n \nCL&P\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\nRenewable Energy Purchase Contracts\n$\n651.0\n \n$\n671.9\n \n$\n723.7\n \n$\n724.5\n \n$\n588.4\n \n$\n3,473.6\n \n$\n6,833.1\n \nCapacity\n72.4\n \n0.1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n72.5\n \nPeaker CfDs\n28.3\n \n27.7\n \n23.1\n \n23.3\n \n24.1\n \n84.6\n \n211.1\n \nTransmission Support Commitments\n6.8\n \n7.4\n \n7.9\n \n8.3\n \n8.6\n \n8.9\n \n47.9\n \nTotal\n$\n758.5\n \n$\n707.1\n \n$\n754.7\n \n$\n756.1\n \n$\n621.1\n \n$\n3,567.1\n \n$\n7,164.6\n \nNSTAR Electric\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\nRenewable Energy Purchase Contracts\n$\n120.8\n \n$\n193.3\n \n$\n196.2\n \n$\n193.5\n \n$\n197.1\n \n$\n2,816.3\n \n$\n3,717.2\n \nPurchased Power\n2.8\n \n2.8\n \n2.7\n \n2.7\n \n2.3\n \n2.3\n \n15.6\n \nTransmission Support Commitments\n6.7\n \n7.4\n \n7.9\n \n8.2\n \n8.6\n \n8.9\n \n47.7\n \nTotal\n$\n130.3\n \n$\n203.5\n \n$\n206.8\n \n$\n204.4\n \n$\n208.0\n \n$\n2,827.5\n \n$\n3,780.5\n \nPSNH\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\nTransmission Support Commitments\n$\n3.6\n \n$\n4.0\n \n$\n4.2\n \n$\n4.4\n \n$\n4.6\n \n$\n4.8\n \n$\n25.6\n \nThe contractual obligations table above does not include CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's or PSNH's standard/basic service contracts for the purchase of energy supply, the amounts of which vary with customers' energy needs.\nRenewable Energy Purchase Contracts:\n  Renewable energy purchase contracts include non-cancellable commitments under contracts of CL&P and NSTAR Electric for the purchase of energy and capacity from renewable energy facilities.  Such contracts extend through 2046 for CL&P and 2045 for NSTAR Electric.  In 2024, the NHPUC approved the termination of a PPA for the purchase of capacity, renewable energy and RECs from a New Hampshire generation plant and there are no remaining long-term renewable energy purchase contracts at PSNH. \nRenewable energy purchase contracts include long-term commitments of NSTAR Electric \npertaining to the Vineyard Wind LLC contract awarded under the Massachusetts Clean Energy 83C procurement solicitation.  NSTAR Electric, along with other Massachusetts distribution companies, entered into \n20-year\n contracts to purchase electricity generated by this 800 megawatt offshore wind project.  Construction on the Vineyard Wind project commenced in 2022.  Estimated energy costs under this contract are expected to begin when the facilities are in service in 2025 and range between $\n100\n million and $\n200\n million per year und\ner NSTAR Electric’s \n20-year\n contract, totaling approximately $\n2.6\n billion. \nAs required by 2018 regulation, CL&P and UI each entered into PURA-approved \nten-year\n contracts in 2019 to purchase a combined total of approximately \n9\n million MWh annually from the Millstone Nuclear Power Station generation facility, which represents a combined amount of approximately \n50\n percent of the facility's output (approximately \n40\n percent by CL&P).  Also as required by 2018 regulation, CL&P and UI each entered into PURA-approved \neight-year\n contracts in 2019 to purchase a combined amount of approximately \n18\n percent of the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant’s output (approximately \n15\n percent by CL&P) beginning January 1, 2022.  The total estimated remaining future cost of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station and Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant energy purchase contracts are $\n2.6\n billion and are reflected in the table above.  As required by law, CL&P cannot use this power to satisfy its customers’ supply obligations.  CL&P sells the energy purchased under these contracts into the market and uses the proceeds from these energy sales to offset the contract costs.  As the net costs under these contracts are recovered from customers in future rates, the contracts do not have an impact on the net income of CL&P.  These contracts do not meet the definition of a derivative, and accordingly, the costs of these contracts are being accounted for as incurred.\nThe contractual obligations table above does not include long-term commitments signed by CL&P and NSTAR Electric, as required by the PURA and the DPU, respectively, for the purchase of renewable energy and related products that are contingent on the future construction of energy facilities, such as the long-term commitments of NSTAR Electric pertaining to the Massachusetts Clean Energy 83D contract entered into in 2018. \nNatural Gas Procurement:\n  Eversource's natural gas distribution businesses have long-term contracts for the purchase, transportation and storage of natural gas as part of its portfolio of supplies, which extend through 2045. \n127\nCapacity and Purchased Power:\n  These contracts include capacity CfDs with generation facilities at CL&P through 2026, and a purchase obligation for electricity which extends through 2031 for NSTAR Electric.  CL&P's portion of the costs and benefits under these capacity contracts are recovered from, or refunded to, CL&P's customers. \nPeaker CfDs:  \nCL&P, along with UI, has \nthree\n peaker CfDs for a total of approximately \n500\n MW of peaking capacity through 2042.  CL&P has a sharing agreement with UI, whereby CL&P is responsible for \n80\n percent and UI for \n20\n percent of the net costs or benefits of these CfDs.  The Peaker CfDs pay the generation facility owner the difference between capacity, forward reserve and energy market revenues and a cost-of-service payment stream for \n30\n years.  The ultimate cost or benefit to CL&P under these contracts will depend on the costs of plant operation and the prices that the projects receive for capacity and other products in the ISO-NE markets.  CL&P's portion of the amounts paid or received under the Peaker CfDs are recovered from, or refunded to, CL&P's customers. \nTransmission Support Commitments:\n  Along with other New England utilities, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH have entered into agreements to support the costs of, and receive rights to use, transmission and terminal facilities that import electricity from the Hydro-Québec system in Canada.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are obligated to pay, over a \n20-year\n period ending in 2040, their proportionate shares of the annual operation and maintenance expenses and capital costs of those facilities. \nThe total costs incurred under these agreements were as follows:\nEversource\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRenewable Energy Purchase Contracts\n$\n591.4\n \n$\n581.4\n \n$\n678.1\n \nNatural Gas Procurement\n695.0\n \n695.8\n \n1,042.8\n \nCapacity and Purchased Power\n70.5\n \n69.0\n \n61.6\n \nPeaker CfDs\n23.1\n \n20.1\n \n13.4\n \nTransmission Support Commitments\n16.7\n \n14.2\n \n12.7\n \n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nRenewable Energy Purchase Contracts\n$\n529.0\n \n$\n62.4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n474.1\n \n$\n60.0\n \n$\n47.3\n \n$\n513.2\n \n$\n90.8\n \n$\n74.1\n \nCapacity and Purchased Power\n67.6\n \n2.9\n \n—\n \n65.5\n \n2.9\n \n0.6\n \n57.7\n \n3.0\n \n0.9\n \nPeaker CfDs\n23.1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n20.1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n13.4\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTransmission Support Commitments\n6.6\n \n6.6\n \n3.5\n \n5.6\n \n5.6\n \n3.0\n \n5.0\n \n5.0\n \n2.7\n \nC.     \nSpent Nuclear Fuel Obligations - Yankee Companies\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH have plant closure and fuel storage cost obligations to the Yankee Companies, which have each completed the physical decommissioning of their respective nuclear power facilities and are now engaged in the long-term storage of their spent fuel.  The Yankee Companies fund these costs through litigation proceeds received from the DOE and, to the extent necessary, through wholesale, FERC-approved rates charged under power purchase agreements with several New England utilities, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, in turn recover these costs from their customers through state regulatory commission-approved retail rates.  The Yankee Companies collect amounts that management believes are adequate to recover the remaining plant closure and fuel storage cost estimates for the respective plants.  Management believes CL&P and NSTAR Electric will recover their shares of these obligations from their customers.  PSNH has recovered its total share of these costs from its customers.\nSpent Nuclear Fuel Litigation:\nThe Yankee Companies have filed complaints against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims seeking monetary damages resulting from the DOE's failure to accept delivery of, and provide for a permanent facility to store, spent nuclear fuel pursuant to the terms of the 1983 spent fuel and high-level waste disposal contracts between the Yankee Companies and the DOE.  The court previously awarded the Yankee Companies damages for Phases I, II, III and IV of litigation resulting from the DOE's failure to meet its contractual obligations.  These Phases covered damages incurred in the years 1998 through 2016, and the awarded damages have been received by the Yankee Companies with certain amounts of the damages refunded to their customers.\nDOE Phase V Damages - \nOn March 25, 2021, each of the Yankee Companies filed a fifth set of lawsuits against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims resulting from the DOE's failure to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal covering the years from 2017 to 2020.  The Yankee Companies filed claims seeking monetary damages totaling $\n120.4\n million for CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC.  Pursuant to a June 2, 2022 court order, the Yankee Companies were subsequently permitted to include monetary damages relating to the year 2021 in the DOE Phase V complaint.  The Yankee Companies submitted a supplemental filing to include these costs of $\n33.1\n million on June 8, 2022.  In September 2024, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the Phase V complaint totaling $\n145\n million for CYAPC, YAEC, and MYAPC.  The settlement was approved on November 19, 2024 and the Department of Justice filed a Notice of Appeal on January 17, 2025 on an issue outside the scope of the settlement.  Oral arguments are expected to be scheduled in the second half of 2025.\n128\nD.    Guarantees and Indemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, Eversource parent provides credit assurances on behalf of its subsidiaries, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, in the form of guarantees.  Management does not anticipate a material impact to net income or cash flows as a result of these various guarantees and indemnifications. \nGuarantees issued on behalf of unconsolidated entities, including equity method ownership interests, for which Eversource parent is the guarantor, are recorded at fair value as a liability on the balance sheet at the inception of the guarantee.  The fair value of guarantees issued on behalf of unconsolidated entities are recorded within Other Long-Term Liabilities on the balance sheet, and were $\n1.2\n million and $\n4.4\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Eversource regularly reviews performance risk under these guarantee arrangements, and believes the likelihood of payments being required under the guarantees is remote.  In the event it becomes probable that Eversource parent will be required to perform under the guarantee, the amount of probable payment will be recorded. \nOn September 30, 2024, Eversource completed the sale of its \n50\n percent ownership share in the South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects to GIP.  Under the agreement with GIP, Eversource’s existing and certain additional credit support obligations for Revolution Wind are expected to roll off as the project completes construction.  On July 9, 2024, Eversource completed the sale of its \n50\n percent ownership share of Sunrise Wind to Ørsted.  Under the agreement with Ørsted, Eversource’s existing credit support obligations for Sunrise Wind were either terminated or indemnified by Ørsted as a result of the sale. \nThe following table summarizes Eversource parent's exposure to guarantees and indemnifications of its subsidiaries and affiliates to external parties, and primarily relates to its previously-owned offshore wind investments:  \nAs of December 31, 2024\nCompany (Obligor)\nDescription\nMaximum Exposure\n(in millions)\nRevolution Wind, LLC and TurbineCo, LLC\nOffshore wind construction-related purchase agreements with third-party contractors \n(1)\n \n$\n357.0\n \nEversource Investment LLC, Eversource Investment Service Company LLC and South Fork Class B Member, LLC\nOffshore wind funding and indemnification obligations \n(2)\n277.5\n \nEversource Investment LLC\nLetters of Credit \n(3)\n5.3\n \nEversource TEI LLC\nSouth Fork Wind Tax Equity \n(4)\n50.0\n \nSouth Fork Wind, LLC\nPower Purchase Agreement Security \n(5)\n7.1\n \nVarious Eversource subsidiaries\nSurety bonds\n (6)\n30.7\n \n(1)    \nEversource parent issued guarantees on behalf of its previously \n50\n percent-owned affiliate, Revolution Wind, LLC, and on behalf of TurbineCo, LLC (successor in interest to North East Offshore, LLC (NEO)), under which Eversource parent agreed to guarantee each entity’s performance of obligations under certain construction-related purchase agreements with third-party contractors, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $\n935.6\n million.  Eversource parent’s obligations under the guarantees expire upon the earlier of (i) dates ranging between December 2024 and November 2027 and (ii) full performance of the guaranteed obligations.  \n(2)    \nEversource parent issued guarantees on behalf of its wholly-owned subsidiary Eversource Investment LLC (EI), which held Eversource's previous investments in offshore wind-related equity method investments until sale, and on behalf of its previously \n50\n percent-owned affiliate, South Fork Class B Member, LLC, whereby Eversource parent will guarantee each entity’s performance of certain funding obligations of the South Fork and Revolution Wind projects.  Eversource parent also guaranteed certain indemnification obligations of EI associated with third party credit support for EI’s investment in NEO.  On September 30, 2024, Eversource parent issued a guaranty on behalf of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eversource Investment Service Company LLC, whereby Eversource parent will guarantee Eversource Investment Service Company LLC’s performance of certain indemnification obligations during the onshore construction phase of the Revolution Wind project, in an amount not to exceed $\n100.0\n million.  These guarantees will not exceed $\n1.62\n billion and expire upon the full performance of the guaranteed obligations.\n(3)    \nEversource parent entered into a guarantee on behalf of EI, under which Eversource parent would guarantee EI's obligations under a letter of credit facility with a financial institution that EI may request in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $\n25\n million.  As of December 31, 2024, EI has issued \ntwo\n letters of credit on behalf of South Fork Wind, LLC and \none\n letter of credit on behalf of Revolution Wind, LLC totaling $\n5.3\n million.  The guarantee will remain in effect until full performance of the guaranteed obligations.  On January 24, 2025, the $\n1.0\n million letter of credit issued on behalf of Revolution Wind, LLC was terminated. \n(4)    \nEversource parent issued a guarantee on behalf of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eversource TEI LLC, whereby Eversource parent will guarantee Eversource TEI LLC’s performance of certain obligations, in an amount not to exceed $\n50.0\n million, in connection with any remaining obligations under the LLC agreement.  Eversource parent’s obligations expire upon the full performance of the guaranteed obligations.\n(5)    \nEversource parent issued a guarantee on behalf of its previously \n50\n percent-owned affiliate, South Fork Wind, LLC, whereby Eversource parent will guarantee South Fork Wind, LLC's performance of certain obligations, in an amount not to exceed $\n7.1\n million, under a Power Purchase Agreement between the Long Island Power Authority and South Fork Wind, LLC (the Agreement).  The guarantee expires upon the later of (i) the end of the Agreement term, January 2044, with the option to extend to January 2049 and (ii) full performance of the guaranteed obligations.\n129\n(6)    \nSurety bonds expire in 2025.  Expiration dates reflect termination dates, the majority of which will be renewed or extended.  Certain surety bonds contain credit ratings triggers that would require Eversource parent to post collateral in the event that the unsecured debt credit ratings of Eversource parent are downgraded.\nOn September 30, 2024, Eversource entered into an agreement with GIP and Ørsted to contingently provide future credit support up to a maximum of $\n850\n million in guarantees, if required, to support third party tax equity financing for Revolution Wind. \nE.    \nFERC ROE Complaints\nFour\n separate complaints were filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively, the Complainants).  In each of the first \nthree\n complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of \n11.14\n percent that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate \n15\n-month complaint periods.  In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE billed of \n10.57\n percent and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive (incentive cap) of \n11.74\n percent, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable. \nThe ROE originally billed during the period October 1, 2011 (beginning of the first complaint period) through October 15, 2014 consisted of a base ROE of \n11.14\n percent and incentives up to \n13.1\n percent.  On October 16, 2014, FERC issued Opinion No. 531-A and set the base ROE at \n10.57\n percent and the incentive cap at \n11.74\n percent for the first complaint period.  This was also effective for all prospective billings to customers beginning October 16, 2014.  This FERC order was vacated on April 14, 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the Court).  \nAll amounts associated with the first complaint period have been refunded, which totaled $\n38.9\n million (pre-tax and excluding interest) at Eversource and reflected both the base ROE and incentive cap prescribed by the FERC order.  The refund consisted of $\n22.4\n million for CL&P, $\n13.7\n million for NSTAR Electric and $\n2.8\n million for PSNH.  \nEversource has recorded a reserve of $\n39.1\n million (pre-tax and excluding interest) for the second complaint period as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.  This reserve represents the difference between the billed rates during the second complaint period and a \n10.57\n percent base ROE and \n11.74\n percent incentive cap.  The reserve consisted of $\n21.4\n million for CL&P, $\n14.6\n million for NSTAR Electric and $\n3.1\n million for PSNH as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nOn October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all \nfour\n complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court.  FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE.  Initial briefs were filed by the NETOs, Complainants and FERC Trial Staff on January 11, 2019 and reply briefs were filed on March 8, 2019.  The NETOs' brief was supportive of the overall ROE methodology determined in the October 16, 2018 order provided the FERC does not change the proposed methodology or alter its implementation in a manner that has a material impact on the results. \nThe FERC order included illustrative calculations for the first complaint using FERC's proposed frameworks with financial data from that complaint.  Those illustrative calculations indicated that for the first complaint period, for the NETOs, which FERC concludes are of average financial risk, the preliminary just and reasonable base ROE is \n10.41\n percent and the preliminary incentive cap on total ROE is \n13.08\n percent.  If the results of the illustrative calculations were included in a final FERC order for each of the complaint periods, then a \n10.41\n percent base ROE and a \n13.08\n percent incentive cap would not have a significant impact on our financial statements for all of the complaint periods.  These preliminary calculations are not binding and do not represent what we believe to be the most likely outcome of a final FERC order.\nOn November 21, 2019, FERC issued Opinion No. 569 affecting the \ntwo\n pending transmission ROE complaints against the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) transmission owners, in which FERC adopted a new methodology for determining base ROEs.  Various parties sought rehearing.  On December 23, 2019, the NETOs filed supplementary materials in the NETOs' \nfour\n pending cases to respond to this new methodology because of the uncertainty of the applicability to the NETOs' cases.  On May 21, 2020, the FERC issued its order in Opinion No. 569-A on the rehearing of the MISO transmission owners' cases, in which FERC again changed its methodology for determining the MISO transmission owners' base ROEs.  On November 19, 2020, the FERC issued Opinion No. 569-B denying rehearing of Opinion No. 569-A and reaffirmed the methodology previously adopted in Opinion No. 569-A.  The new methodology differs significantly from the methodology proposed by FERC in its October 16, 2018 order to determine the NETOs' base ROEs in their \nfour\n pending cases.  FERC Opinion Nos. 569-A and 569-B were appealed to the Court.  On August 9, 2022, the Court issued its decision vacating MISO ROE FERC Opinion Nos. 569, 569-A and 569-B and remanded to FERC to reopen the proceedings.  The Court found that FERC’s development of the new return methodology was arbitrary and capricious due to FERC’s failure to offer a reasonable explanation for its decision to reintroduce the risk-premium financial model in its new methodology for calculating a just and reasonable return.  \nOn October 17, 2024, FERC issued an order on the remand of the MISO ROE proceedings. The order addressed the Court’s decision that the reintroduction of the risk-premium financial model in the ROE methodology was arbitrary and capricious by removing the risk-premium financial model from the ROE methodology.  The removal of the risk-premium financial model was the only revision to FERC’s ROE methodology and resulted in a two-model approach utilizing the two-step discounted cash flow model and the capital asset pricing model.  MISO was directed to provide refunds for the period November 12, 2013 to February 11, 2015 (the first MISO ROE complaint refund period) and for the period from September 28, 2016 (the date of FERC’s order on the first MISO ROE complaint) to October 17, 2024 by December 1, 2025.  The order also stated that FERC does not preclude the use of the risk-premium financial model in future proceedings if the parties can demonstrate that FERC’s stated concerns around the inclusion of the model have been addressed.\n130\nOn November 13, 2024, the NETOs filed a supplemental brief in their four pending ROE proceedings to explain to FERC that it cannot apply the reasoning and methodologies of the MISO ROE case to the NETOs’ cases due to the entirely different set of facts in the MISO and NETOs ROE proceedings.  Doing so would violate the substance of the Court’s April 14, 2017 order and would violate the legal standard required by the Federal Power Act.\nOn February 4, 2025, the MISO transmission owners submitted a petition for review with the Court requesting review of the October 17, 2024 MISO ROE order on remand and a December 19, 2024 notice of denial of rehearing.  The petition requests review of FERC’s decision to retroactively backdate the MISO transmission owners’ base ROE to the date of an earlier order that FERC abandoned when it issued Order No. 569, treat an underlying unlawful complaint as if it were legitimate, and order eight years of interest as part of the directed refunds.\nGiven the significant uncertainty regarding the applicability of the FERC order in the MISO transmission owners’ \ntwo\n complaint cases to the NETOs’ pending \nfour\n complaint cases due to the complex differences between the cases, Eversource concluded that there is no reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaints or subsequent periods at this time and Eversource cannot reasonably estimate any potential range of loss for any of the \nfour\n complaint proceedings at this time. The resolution of these proceedings could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH currently record revenues at the \n10.57\n percent base ROE and incentive cap at \n11.74\n percent established in the October 16, 2014 FERC order.\nA change of \n10\n basis points to the base ROE used to establish the reserves would impact Eversource’s after-tax earnings by an average of approximately $\n3\n million for each of the \nfour\n \n15-month\n complaint periods.\nF.     Litigation and Legal Proceedings\nEversource, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, are involved in legal, tax and regulatory proceedings regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business, which involve management's assessment to determine the probability of whether a loss will occur and, if probable, its best estimate of probable loss.  The Company records and discloses losses when these losses are probable and reasonably estimable, and discloses matters when losses are probable but not estimable or when losses are reasonably possible.  Legal costs related to the defense of loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.\n14.     \nLEASES  \nEversource, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, has entered into lease agreements as a lessee for the use of land, office space, service centers, vehicles, information technology, and equipment.  These lease agreements are classified as either finance or operating leases and the liability and right-of-use asset are recognized on the balance sheet at lease commencement.  Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nEversource determines whether or not a contract contains a lease based on whether or not it provides Eversource with the use of a specifically identified asset for a period of time, as well as both the right to direct the use of that asset and receive the significant economic benefits of the asset.  Eversource has elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components and instead to account for both as a single lease component, with the exception of the information technology asset class where the lease and non-lease components are separated. \nThe provisions of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH lease agreements contain renewal options.  The renewal options range from \none year\n to \ntwenty years\n.  The renewal period is included in the measurement of the lease liability if it is reasonably certain that Eversource will exercise these renewal options. \nFor leases entered into or modified after the January 1, 2019 implementation date of the leases standard under Topic 842, the discount rate utilized for classification and measurement purposes as of the inception date of the lease is based on each company's collateralized incremental interest rate to borrow over a comparable term for an individual lease because the rate implicit in the lease is not determinable. \nCL&P and PSNH entered into certain contracts for the purchase of energy that qualify as leases.  These contracts do not have minimum lease payments and therefore are not recognized as a lease liability on the balance sheet and are not reflected in the future minimum lease payments table below.  Expense related to these contracts is included as variable lease cost in the table below.  The expense and long-term obligation for these contracts are also included in Note 13B, \"Commitments and Contingencies - Long-Term Contractual Arrangements,\" to the financial statements. In 2024, these contracts at PSNH were terminated.  \n131\nThe components of lease cost, prior to amounts capitalized, are as follows:\nEversource\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFinance Lease Cost:\nAmortization of Right-of-use-Assets\n$\n6.4\n \n$\n4.8\n \n$\n8.3\n \nInterest on Lease Liabilities\n2.7\n \n2.0\n \n2.0\n \nTotal Finance Lease Cost\n9.1\n \n6.8\n \n10.3\n \nOperating Lease Cost\n15.2\n \n11.4\n \n11.6\n \nVariable Lease Cost\n18.3\n \n69.2\n \n78.1\n \nTotal Lease Cost\n$\n42.6\n \n$\n87.4\n \n100.0\n \n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Millions of Dollars)\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nCL&P\nNSTAR\nElectric\nPSNH\nFinance Lease Cost:\nAmortization of Right-of-use-Assets\n$\n1.7\n \n$\n0.2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n0.2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n0.2\n \n$\n0.1\n \nInterest on Lease Liabilities\n0.8\n \n0.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n0.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n0.6\n \n—\n \nTotal Finance Lease Cost\n2.5\n \n0.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n0.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n0.8\n \n0.1\n \nOperating Lease Cost\n2.6\n \n5.3\n \n1.8\n \n0.7\n \n3.0\n \n0.4\n \n0.3\n \n2.3\n \n0.1\n \nVariable Lease Cost\n18.9\n \n—\n \n(\n0.6\n)\n21.9\n \n—\n \n47.3\n \n25.6\n \n—\n \n52.5\n \nTotal Lease Cost\n$\n24.0\n \n$\n6.1\n \n$\n1.2\n \n$\n22.6\n \n$\n3.8\n \n$\n47.7\n \n$\n25.9\n \n$\n3.1\n \n$\n52.7\n \nOperating lease cost, net of the capitalized portion, is included in Operations and Maintenance (or Purchased Power, Purchased Natural Gas and Transmission expense for transmission leases) on the statements of income.

Pursuant to the joint revolving credit agreement of Eversource, CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas, EGMA and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, and to the NSTAR Electric revolving credit agreement, Eversource is required to maintain consolidated total indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than \n70\n percent at the end of each fiscal quarter and each other company is required to maintain consolidated total indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than \n65\n percent at the end of each fiscal quarter.  As of December 31, 2024, all companies were in compliance with suc\nh covenant \nand in compliance with all such provisions of the revolving credit agreements that may restrict the payment of dividends as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Retained Earnings balances subject to dividend restrictions were $\n3.93\n billion for Eversource, $\n2.82\n billion for CL&P, $\n3.13\n billion for NSTAR Electric and $\n808.7\n million for PSNH as of December 31, 2024.\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are subject to Section 305 of the Federal Power Act that makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds \"properly included in its capital account.\"  Management believes that this Federal Power Act restriction, as applied to CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, would not be construed or applied by the FERC to prohibit the payment of dividends from retained earnings for lawful and legitimate business purposes.  In addition, certain state statutes may impose additional limitations on such companies and, including but not limited to, on NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas, EGMA, and Aquarion’s operating companies.  Such state law restrictions do not restrict the payment of dividends from retained earnings or net income.\n \n18.     \nCOMMON SHARES\nThe following table sets forth the Eversource parent common shares and the shares of common stock of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that were authorized and issued, as well as the respective per share par values:  \n \nShares\n \nPar Value\nAuthorized as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\nIssued as of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nEversource\n$\n5\n \n410,000,000\n \n375,724,367\n \n359,984,073\n \nCL&P\n$\n10\n \n24,500,000\n \n6,035,205\n \n6,035,205\n \nNSTAR Electric\n$\n1\n \n100,000,000\n \n200\n \n200\n \nPSNH\n$\n1\n \n100,000,000\n \n301\n \n301\n \n135\nCommon Share Issuances: \n Eversource had an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which it could offer and sell up to $\n1.2\n billion of its common shares from time to time through an “at-the-market” (ATM) equity offering program.  Eversource issued and sold its common shares through its sales agents during the term of this agreement.  Shares were offered in transactions on\n the New York Stock Exchange, in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise.  Sales were made at either market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.  In 2024, Eversource issued \n15,740,294\n common shares, which resulted in proceeds of $\n989.4\n million, net of issuance costs.  Eversource used the net proceeds received for general corporate purposes.  In 2023, \nno\n shares were issued under this agreement.  Eversource completed the program in October 2024. \nTreasury Shares:\n  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were \n9,116,315\n and \n10,443,807\n Eversource common shares held as treasury shares, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were \n366,608,052\n and \n349,540,266\n Eversource common shares outstanding, respectively. \nAcquisition of The Torrington Water Company:  \nOn October 3, 2022, Aquarion acquired The Torrington Water Company (TWC) following the receipt of all required approvals.  The acquisition was structured as a stock-for-stock merger and Eversource issued \n925,264\n treasury shares at closing for a purchase price of $\n72.1\n million.  \nEversource issues treasury shares to satisfy awards under the Company's incentive plans, shares issued under the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan, and matching contributions under the Eversource 401k Plan.  Eversource also issued treasury shares for its October 2022 water business acquisitions.  The issuance of treasury shares represents a non-cash transaction, as the treasury shares were used to fulfill Eversource's obligations that require the issuance of common shares.\nOn May 3, 2023, shareholders voted to increase the authorized common shares from \n380,000,000\n shares to \n410,000,000\n shares. \n19.     \nPREFERRED STOCK NOT SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION\nThe CL&P and NSTAR Electric preferred stock is not subject to mandatory redemption and is presented as a noncontrolling interest of a subsidiary in Eversource's financial statements. \nCL&P is authorized to issue up to \n9,000,000\n shares of preferred stock, par value $\n50\n per share, and NSTAR Electric is authorized to issue \n2,890,000\n shares of preferred stock, par value $\n100\n per share.  Holders of preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric are entitled to receive cumulative dividends in preference to any payment of dividends on the common stock.  Upon liquidation, holders of preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric are entitled to receive a liquidation preference before any distribution to holders of common stock in an amount equal to the par value of the preferred stock plus accrued and unpaid dividends.  If the net assets were to be insufficient to pay the liquidation preference in full, then the net assets would be distributed ratably to all holders of preferred stock.  The preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric is subject to optional redemption by the CL&P and NSTAR Electric Boards of Directors at any time. \nDetails of preferred stock not subject to mandatory redemption are as follows (in millions, except in redemption price and shares):  \n \nRedemption Price\nPer Share\nShares Outstanding as of December 31,\nAs of December 31,\nSeries\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCL&P\n \n \n \n \n$\n1.90\nSeries of 1947\n$\n52.50\n \n163,912\n \n163,912\n \n$\n8.2\n \n$\n8.2\n \n$\n2.00\nSeries of 1947\n$\n54.00\n \n336,088\n \n336,088\n \n16.8\n \n16.8\n \n$\n2.04\nSeries of 1949\n$\n52.00\n \n100,000\n \n100,000\n \n5.0\n \n5.0\n \n$\n2.20\nSeries of 1949\n$\n52.50\n \n200,000\n \n200,000\n \n10.0\n \n10.0\n \n3.90\n%\nSeries of 1949\n$\n50.50\n \n160,000\n \n160,000\n \n8.0\n \n8.0\n \n$\n2.06\nSeries E of 1954\n$\n51.00\n \n200,000\n \n200,000\n \n10.0\n \n10.0\n \n$\n2.09\nSeries F of 1955\n$\n51.00\n \n100,000\n \n100,000\n \n5.0\n \n5.0\n \n4.50\n%\nSeries of 1956\n$\n50.75\n \n104,000\n \n104,000\n \n5.2\n \n5.2\n \n4.96\n%\nSeries of 1958\n$\n50.50\n \n100,000\n \n100,000\n \n5.0\n \n5.0\n \n4.50\n%\nSeries of 1963\n$\n50.50\n \n160,000\n \n160,000\n \n8.0\n \n8.0\n \n5.28\n%\nSeries of 1967\n$\n51.43\n \n200,000\n \n200,000\n \n10.0\n \n10.0\n \n$\n3.24\nSeries G of 1968\n$\n51.84\n \n300,000\n \n300,000\n \n15.0\n \n15.0\n \n6.56\n%\nSeries of 1968\n$\n51.44\n \n200,000\n \n200,000\n \n10.0\n \n10.0\n \nTotal CL&P\n \n2,324,000\n \n2,324,000\n \n$\n116.2\n \n$\n116.2\n \nNSTAR Electric\n \n \n \n \n \n4.25\n%\nSeries of 1956\n$\n103.625\n \n180,000\n \n180,000\n \n$\n18.0\n \n$\n18.0\n \n4.78\n%\nSeries of 1958\n$\n102.80\n \n250,000\n \n250,000\n \n25.0\n \n25.0\n \nTotal NSTAR Electric\n \n430,000\n \n430,000\n \n$\n43.0\n \n$\n43.0\n \nFair Value Adjustment due to Merger with NSTAR\n \n(\n3.6\n)\n(\n3.6\n)\nTotal Eversource - Noncontrolling Interest - Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries\n$\n155.6\n \n$\n155.6\n \n136\n20.     \nCOMMON SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nDividends on the preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric totaled $\n7.5\n million for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.  These dividends were presented as Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests on the Eversource statements of income.  Noncontrolling Interest – Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries on the Eversource balance sheets totaled $\n155.6\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.  On the Eversource balance sheets, Common Shareholders' Equity was fully attributable to Eversource parent and Noncontrolling Interest – Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries was fully attributable to the noncontrolling interest. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there was no change in ownership of the common equity of CL&P and NSTAR Electric.\n  \n21.     \nEARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  Diluted earnings/(loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the potential dilutive effect of certain share-based compensation awards as if they were converted into outstanding common shares.  The dilutive effect of unvested RSU and performance share awards is calculated using the treasury stock method.  RSU and performance share awards are included in basic weighted average common shares outstanding as of the date that all necessary vesting conditions have been satisfied.  \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were \nno\n antidilutive share awards excluded from the computation. \nThe following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share:\nEversource\n(Millions of Dollars, except share information)\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet Income/(Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$\n811.7\n \n$\n(\n442.2\n)\n$\n1,404.9\n \nWeighted Average Common Shares Outstanding:\n \n \n \nBasic\n357,482,965\n \n349,580,638\n \n346,783,444\n \nDilutive Effect\n296,443\n \n259,843\n \n463,324\n \nDiluted\n357,779,408\n \n349,840,481\n \n347,246,768\n \nBasic Earnings/(Loss) Per Common Share\n$\n2.27\n \n$\n(\n1.27\n)\n$\n4.05\n \nDiluted Earnings/(Loss) Per Common Share\n$\n2.27\n \n$\n(\n1.26\n)\n$\n4.05\n \n22.    \nREVENUES\nRevenue is recognized when promised goods or services (referred to as performance obligations) are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  A five-step model is used for recognizing and measuring revenue from contracts with customers, which includes identifying the contract with the customer, identifying the performance obligations promised within the contract, determining the transaction price (the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled), allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognizing revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. \nThe following tables present operating revenues disaggregated by revenue source:\nFor the Year Ended

utilities provide products and services to their regulated customers under rates, pricing, payment terms and conditions of service, regulated by each state regulatory agency.  The arrangement whereby a utility provides commodity service to a customer for a price approved by the respective state regulatory commission is referred to as a tariff sale contract, and the tariff governs all aspects of the provision of regulated services by utilities.  The majority of revenue for Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH is derived from regulated retail tariff sales for the sale and distribution of electricity, natural gas and water to residential, commercial and industrial retail customers. \nThe utility's performance obligation for the regulated tariff sales is to provide electricity, natural gas or water to the customer as demanded.  The promise to provide the commodity represents a single performance obligation, as it is a promise to transfer a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.  Revenue is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the utility, and the utility satisfies its performance obligation.  Revenue is recognized based on the output method as there is a directly observable output to the customer (electricity, natural gas or water units delivered to the customer and immediately consumed).  Each Eversource utility is entitled to be compensated for performance completed to date (service taken by the customer) until service is terminated. \nIn regulated tariff sales, the transaction prices are the rates approved by the respective state regulatory commissions.  In general, rates can only be changed through formal proceedings with the state regulatory commissions.  These rates are designed to recover the costs to provide service to customers and include a return on investment.  Regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms are included in these rates and are also used to recover, on a fully-reconciling basis, certain costs, such as the procurement of energy supply, state mandated energy purchase agreements, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, net metering for distributed generation, and restructuring and stranded costs, among others.  These tracking mechanisms result in rates being changed periodically to ensure recovery of actual costs incurred and the refund of any overcollection of costs. \nElectric customers may elect to purchase electricity from each Eversource electric utility or may contract separately with a competitive third party supplier.  Certain eligible natural gas customers may elect to purchase natural gas from each Eversource natural gas utility or may contract separately with a gas supply operator.  Revenue is not recorded for the sale of the electricity or the natural gas commodity to customers who have contracted separately with these suppliers, only the delivery to a customer, as the utility is acting as an agent on behalf of the supplier.\nWholesale Transmission Revenues:\n  The Eversource electric transmission-owning companies (CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH) each own and maintain transmission facilities that are part of an interstate power transmission grid over which electricity is transmitted throughout New England.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, as well as most other New England utilities, are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the region's transmission facilities and the rules by which they acquire transmission services.  The Eversource electric transmission-owning companies have a combination of FERC-approved regional and local formula rates that are designed to work in tandem to recover all their transmission costs.  These rates are part of the ISO-NE Tariff.  Regional rates recover the costs of higher voltage transmission facilities that benefit the region and are collected from all New England transmission customers, including the Eversource distribution businesses.  Eversource's local rates generally recover the costs of transmission facilities that do not provide a benefit to the region, and are collected from Eversource's distribution businesses and other transmission customers.  The distribution businesses of Eversource, in turn, recover the FERC approved charges from retail customers through annual tracking mechanisms, which are retail tariff sales. \nThe utility's performance obligation for regulated wholesale transmission sales is to provide transmission services to the customer as demanded.  The promise to provide transmission service represents a single performance obligation.  The transaction prices are the transmission rate formulas as defined by the ISO-NE Tariff and are regulated and established by FERC.  Wholesale transmission revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is completed, which occurs as transmission services are provided to customers.  The revenue is recognized based on the output method.  Each Eversource utility is entitled to be compensated for performance completed to date (e.g., use of the transmission system by the customer). \nWholesale Market Sales Revenues:  \nWholesale market sales transactions include sales of energy and energy-related products into the ISO-NE wholesale electricity market, sales of natural gas to third party marketers, and also the sale of RECs to various counterparties.  ISO-NE oversees the region's wholesale electricity market and administers the transactions and terms and conditions, including payment terms, which are established in the ISO-NE tariff, between the buyers and sellers in the market.  Pricing is set by the wholesale market.  The wholesale transactions in the ISO-NE market occur on a day-ahead basis or a real-time basis (daily) and are, therefore, short-term.  Transactions are tracked and reported by ISO-NE net by the hour, which is the net hourly position of energy sales and purchases by each market participant.  The performance obligation for ISO-NE energy transactions is defined to be the net by hour transaction.  Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation for these energy sales transactions is satisfied, which is when the sale occurs and the energy is transferred to the customer.  For sales of natural gas, transportation, and natural gas pipeline capacity to third party marketers, revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time the sale occurs and the natural gas or related product is transferred to the marketer.  RECs are sold to various counterparties, and revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied upon transfer of title to the customer through the New England Power Pool Generation Information System.  Wholesale transactions also include the sale of CL&P’s, NSTAR Electric’s and PSNH’s transmission rights associated with their proportionate equity ownership share in the transmission lines of the Hydro-Québec system in Canada.  \nOther Revenues from Contracts with Customers:  \nOther revenues from contracts with customers primarily include property rentals that are not deemed leases.  These revenues are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over time as the service is provided to the customer.  Other revenues also include revenues from Eversource's service company, which is eliminated in consolidation.\n139\nAmortization of/(Reserve for) Revenues Subject to Refund:\n  A reserve is recorded as a reduction to revenues when future refunds to customers are deemed probable.  The reserve is reversed as refunds are provided to customers in rates.  Amortization of Revenues Subject to Refund within the Electric Distribution segment in 2022 represents the reversal of a 2021 reserve at CL&P established to provide bill credits to customers as a result of the settlement agreement on October 1, 2021 and a storm performance penalty assessed by PURA.  The reserve of $\n93.4\n million was reversed as customer credits were distributed to CL&P’s customers in retail electric rates in 2021 and 2022.  \nAlternative Revenue Programs:   \nIn accordance with accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, certain of Eversource's utilities' rate making mechanisms qualify as alternative revenue programs (ARPs) if they meet specified criteria, in which case revenues may be recognized prior to billing based on allowed levels of collection in rates.  Eversource's utility companies recognize revenue and record a regulatory asset or liability once the condition or event allowing for the automatic adjustment of future rates occurs.  ARP revenues include both the recognition of the deferral adjustment to ARP revenues, when the regulator-specified condition or event allowing for additional billing or refund has occurred, and an equal and offsetting reversal of the ARP deferral to revenues as those amounts are reflected in the price of service in subsequent periods.\nEversource’s ARPs include the revenue decoupling mechanism, the annual reconciliation adjustment to transmission formula rates, and certain capital tracker mechanisms.  Certain Eversource electric, natural gas and water companies, including CL&P and NSTAR Electric, have revenue decoupling mechanisms approved by a regulatory commission (decoupled companies).  Decoupled companies’ distribution revenues are not directly based on sales volumes.  The decoupled companies reconcile their annual base distribution rate recovery to pre-established levels of baseline distribution delivery service revenues, with any difference between the allowed level of distribution revenue and the actual amount realized adjusted through subsequent rates.  The transmission formula rates provide for the annual reconciliation and recovery or refund of estimated costs to actual costs.  The financial impacts of differences between actual and estimated costs are deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, transmission customers.  This transmission deferral reconciles billed transmission revenues to the revenue requirement for our transmission businesses.\nOther Revenues:\n  Other Revenues include certain fees charged to customers that are not considered revenue from contracts with customers.  \nOther revenues\n also include lease revenues under lessor accounting guidance of $\n2.5\n million ($\n0.5\n million at CL&P and $\n1.2\n million at NSTAR Electric), $\n4.6\n million ($\n0.7\n million at CL&P and $\n2.5\n million at NSTAR Electric), and $\n4.0\n million, ($\n0.8\n million at CL&P and $\n2.5\n million at NSTAR Electric) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nIntercompany Eliminations:\n  Intercompany eliminations are primarily related to the Eversource electric transmission revenues that are derived from ISO-NE regional transmission charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that recover the costs of the wholesale transmission business, and revenues from Eversource's service company.  Intercompany revenues and expenses between the Eversource wholesale transmission businesses and the Eversource distribution businesses and from Eversource's service company are eliminated in consolidation and included in \"Eliminations\" in the tables above. \nReceivables:  \nReceivables, Net on the balance sheet primarily includes trade receivables from retail customers and customers related to wholesale transmission contracts, wholesale market sales, sales of RECs, and property rentals.  In general, retail tariff customers and wholesale transmission customers are billed monthly and the payment terms are generally due and payable upon receipt of the bill.\nUnbilled Revenues:\n Unbilled Revenues on the balance sheet represent estimated amounts due from retail customers for electricity, natural gas or water delivered to customers but not yet billed.  The utility company has satisfied its performance obligation and the customer has received and consumed the commodity as of the balance sheet date, and therefore, the utility company records revenue for those services in the period the services were provided.  Only the passage of time is required before the company is entitled to payment for the satisfaction of the performance obligation.  Payment from customers is due monthly as services are rendered and amounts are billed.  Actual amounts billed to customers when meter readings become available may vary from the estimated amount.\nUnbilled revenues are recognized by allocating estimated unbilled sales volumes to the respective customer classes, and then applying an estimated rate by customer class to those sales volumes.  Unbilled revenue estimates reflect seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns, customer rates in effect for customer classes, and the timing of customer billing.  The companies that have a decoupling mechanism record a regulatory deferral to reflect the actual allowed amount of revenue associated with their respective decoupled distribution rate design.  \nPractical Expedients:  \nEversource has elected practical expedients in the accounting guidance that allow the company to record revenue in the amount that the company has a right to invoice, if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the company's performance to date, and not to disclose related unsatisfied performance obligations.  Retail and wholesale transmission tariff sales fall into this category, as these sales are recognized as revenue in the period the utility provides the service and completes the performance obligation, which is the same as the monthly amount billed to customers.  There are no other material revenue streams for which Eversource has unsatisfied performance obligations.\n \n140\n23.     \nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nEversource is organized into the Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution reportable segments and Other based on a combination of factors, including the characteristics of each segments' services, the sources of operating revenues and expenses and the regulatory environment in which each segment operates.  The Electric Distribution segment consists of the rate-regulated distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, and includes the results of NSTAR Electric's solar power facilities.  The Electric Transmission segment consists of the rate-regulated electric transmission businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.  The Natural Gas Distribution segment consists of the rate-regulated businesses of Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and EGMA. The Water Distribution segment consists of the rate-regulated business of Aquarion.  These reportable segments represent substantially all of Eversource's total consolidated revenues.  Revenues from the sale of electricity, natural gas and water primarily are derived from residential, commercial and industrial customers and are not dependent on any single customer.  \nEversource's reportable segments are determined based upon the level at which Eversource's chief operating decision maker assesses performance and makes decisions about the allocation of company resources.  The chief operating decision maker uses the net income of each reportable segment to evaluate return generated from assets and decide how to reinvest profits and allocate resources, to monitor budget-to-actual results, in the planning and forecasting process, in determining compensation achievement, and in benchmarking to Eversource’s peers.  Eversource’s chief operating decision maker is its chief executive officer.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.\nThe remainder of Eversource's operations is presented as Other in the tables below and primarily consists of 1) the equity in earnings of Eversource parent from its subsidiaries and intercompany interest income, both of which are eliminated in consolidation, and interest expense related to the debt of Eversource parent, 2) the revenues and expenses of Eversource Service, most of which are eliminated in consolidation, 3) the operations of CYAPC and YAEC, 4) the results of other unregulated subsidiaries, which are not part of its core business, and 5) Eversource parent's equity ownership interests that are not consolidated, which primarily included the offshore wind investments until sale of the three offshore wind projects in 2024 and a\n \nnatural gas pipeline owned by Enbridge, Inc.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and EGMA purchase natural gas transmission services from the Enbridge, Inc. natural gas pipeline project described above.  These affiliate transaction costs total $\n77.7\n million annually and are classified as Purchased Power, Purchased Natural Gas and Transmission on the Eversource statements of income.\nEach of Eversource's subsidiaries, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, has \none\n reportable segment. \nCash flows used for investments in plant included in the segment information below are cash capital expenditures that do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized and deferred portions of pension and PBOP income/expense.  \nEversource's segment information is as follows:\n \nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nEversource\n(Millions of Dollars)\nElectric\nDistribution\nNatural

that is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.  Costs of the operations organization include labor and overtime, outside services, vehicles, vegetation management, employee expenses, fees and payments, regulatory assessments, and materials, partially offset by reimbursements.  Corporate shared services include corporate centralized functions.  Costs within these corporate functions primarily include labor, services by vendors, fees and payments, insurance, and regulatory assessments.  Other includes information technology system depreciation at Eversource Service charged to the operating businesses, as well as storm funding, capitalization and various other corporate costs.  The segment-level operating expense for information technology system depreciation is eliminated and reflected in depreciation in Eversource’s consolidation.\n \n142\nFor the water distribution segment, the chief operating decision maker is provided with total operations and maintenance expense information to manage its operations. Operations and maintenance expenses primarily include employee costs, benefits, and outside services.\n(2)\n    Other segment line items for the electric distribution, electric transmission and natural gas distribution segments primarily include purchased power, purchased natural gas and transmission, taxes other than income taxes including property, payroll-related and Connecticut gross earnings taxes, and energy efficiency program expenses.  Other segment line items for the water distribution business primarily include taxes other than income taxes.\n \n24.    \nASSETS HELD FOR SALE\nIn early 2024, Eversource initiated an exploratory assessment of the potential sale of the Aquarion water distribution business.  In December 2024, final bids were received, and Eversource obtained approval from its Board of Trustees to sell the Aquarion water distribution business.  On January 27, 2025, Eversource entered into a definitive agreement to sell Aquarion.  Subject to certain closing adjustments, the aggregate enterprise value of the sale is approximately $\n2.4\n billion in cash, which includes approximately $\n1.6\n billion for the equity and $\n800\n million of net debt that will be extinguished at closing.  The sale is subject to approval by PURA, DPU and the NHPUC, as well as other approvals pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act as well as other customary closing conditions.  The sale is expected to close in late 2025.  Eversource plans to use the net proceeds from the pending sale to pay down parent company debt.\nThe assets and liabilities of the Aquarion water distribution business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and have been classified separately as current or long-term assets and liabilities held for sale on the Eversource balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.  As Eversource concluded this is the sale of a business, all goodwill held by the water distribution reporting unit was included in the carrying amount of the business and is also classified within assets held for sale.  Long-term debt will be repaid by Eversource upon closing and is therefore excluded from liabilities held for sale.  Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.  In the fourth quarter of 2024, upon classifying the assets and liabilities as held for sale, Eversource concluded that the likely sale of Aquarion at a loss resulted in the requirement to test water distribution goodwill for impairment.  Eversource performed an impairment test by comparing the fair value of the business to its carrying value and recorded a goodwill impairment of $\n297\n million, as the estimated fair value of the business based on the anticipated sale was less than the carrying value.  The fair value included future cash outflows of approximately $\n140\n million of estimated income taxes as a result of the transaction.  The goodwill impairment charge is presented separately within Operating Income on the Eversource statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2024.  The water distribution business did not and will not meet the criteria to be presented as a discontinued operation. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the major classes of Aquarion’s assets and liabilities presented in current and long-term Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Held for Sale on the Eversource balance sheet, which are included in the Water Distribution reportable segment, were as follows: \n(Millions of Dollars)\nRestricted Cash\n$\n5.8\n \nReceivables, Net\n14.4\n \nUnbilled Revenues\n11.5\n \nPrepayments and Other Current Assets\n24.6\n \n   Total Current Assets Held for Sale\n$\n56.3\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\n$\n1,885.2\n \nRegulatory Assets\n51.2\n \nGoodwill\n662.5\n \nOther Long-Term Assets\n12.2\n \n   Total Long-Term Assets Held for Sale\n$\n2,611.1\n \nAccounts Payable\n$\n24.2\n \nOther Current Liabilities\n28.4\n \n   Total Current Liabilities Held for Sale\n$\n52.6\n \nRegulatory Liabilities\n$\n132.2\n \nOther Long-Term Liabilities\n266.7\n \n   Total Long-Term Liabilities Held for Sale\n$\n398.9\n \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, pre-tax income associated with the held for sale water distribution business (excluding the goodwill impairment recognized in 2024) was $\n43.1\n million, $\n26.8\n million and $\n33.6\n million, respectively.\n \n143\n25.    \nGOODWILL\nIn a business combination, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.  \nThe following table presents Eversource’s goodwill by reportable segment:\n(Millions of Dollars)\nElectric\nDistribution\nElectric\nTransmission\nNatural Gas\nDistribution\nWater \nDistribution\nTotal\nBalance as of January 1, 2023\n$\n2,543.6\n \n$\n576.8\n \n$\n451.0\n \n$\n951.2\n \n$\n4,522.6\n \nWater Acquisitions\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n9.5\n \n9.5\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n2,543.6\n \n$\n576.8\n \n$\n451.0\n \n$\n960.7\n \n$\n4,532.1\n \nWater Sale and Acquisition, net\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n1.2\n)\nWater Goodwill Impairment\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n297.0\n)\n(\n297.0\n)\nWater Goodwill Reclassified as Held for Sale\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n662.5\n)\n(\n662.5\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n2,543.6\n \n$\n576.8\n \n$\n451.0\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,571.4\n \nIn 2023, Eversource completed \ntwo\n water acquisitions resulting in the addition of $\n9.5\n million of goodwill.  In 2024, Eversource completed the sale of its unregulated water business resulting in a reduction to goodwill of $\n5.4\n million and completed a water acquisition resulting in the addition of $\n4.2\n million of goodwill. \nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to an assessment for impairment at least annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of Eversource’s reporting units below their carrying amounts.  Eversource's reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill are Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution.  These reporting units are consistent with the operating segments underlying the reportable segments identified in Note 23, \"Segment Information,\" to the financial statements.  \nIn assessing goodwill for impairment, an entity is permitted to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists as of the annual impairment test date.  If after performing the qualitative assessment it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed.  A quantitative impairment test is required only if it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s carrying value may not be recoverable.  The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  A resulting write-down, if any, would be charged to Operating Expenses.   \nEversource completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution reporting units as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no impairment existed.  The annual goodwill assessment included a qualitative evaluation of multiple factors that impact the fair value of the reporting units, including general, macroeconomic and market conditions, and entity-specific assumptions that affect the future cash flows of the reporting units.  Key considerations include discount rates, utility sector market performance and merger transaction multiples, the Company's share price and credit ratings, analyst reports, financial performance, cost and risk factors, internal estimates and projections of future cash flows and net income, long-term strategy, the timing and outcome of rate cases, and recent regulatory and legislative proceedings.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Eversource concluded that the likely sale of Aquarion at a loss resulted in the requirement to perform an interim goodwill impairment test for Water Distribution goodwill.  Eversource compared the estimated fair value of the business from the anticipated transaction to its carrying value.  Assumptions used in the valuation were the future cash flows from the sale, including approximately $\n140\n million of estimated income tax impacts as a result of the transaction.  Based on the interim impairment test, Eversource recorded a goodwill impairment of $\n297\n million to write down the carrying value of the water distribution reporting unit to its estimated fair value.  The goodwill impairment charge is presented separately within Operating Income on the Eversource statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2024.  \nThe remaining goodwill held by the water distribution reporting unit was reclassified to Assets Held for Sale on the Eversource balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.\n \n144\nItem 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n \nNo events that would be described in response to this item have occurred with respect to Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric or PSNH.\nItem 9A.    Controls and Procedures\nManagement, on behalf of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the accompanying Financial Statements and other sections of this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Eversource's internal controls over financial reporting were audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP.    \nManagement, on behalf of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting.  The internal control framework and processes have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.  There are inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting that could allow material misstatements due to error or fraud to occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees during the normal course of business.  Additionally, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate in the future due to changes in the business environment.  Under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting was conducted based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on this evaluation under the framework in COSO, management concluded that internal controls over financial reporting at Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH were effective as of December 31, 2024.\nManagement, on behalf of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, evaluated the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024 to determine whether they are effective in ensuring that the disclosure of required information is made timely and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations of the SEC.  This evaluation was made under management's supervision and with management's participation, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  There are inherent limitations of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumventing or overriding of the controls and procedures.  Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.  The principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded, based on their review, that the disclosure controls and procedures of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and regulations and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nThere have been no changes in internal controls over financial reporting for Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.    Other Information\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers \nadopted\n, modified, or \nterminated\n a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as such terms are defined under Item 408 of Regulation S-K.  \nNo additional information is required to be disclosed under this item as of December 31, 2024, as this information has been previously disclosed in applicable reports on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n145\nPART III\nItem 10.\n    \nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nEversource Energy\nThe information required by this Item 10 for Eversource Energy is incorporated herein by reference to certain information contained in the sections captioned “Election of Trustees,” and “Governance of Eversource Energy” plus related subsections, of Eversource Energy’s definitive proxy statement for solicitation of proxies, expected to be filed with the SEC on or about March 21, 2025.\nInformation concerning executive officers of Eversource Energy required by this Item 10 is reported under a separate caption entitled “Information About Our Executive Officers” in Part I of this report.\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH\nCertain information required by this Item 10 is omitted for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH pursuant to Instruction I(2)(c) to Form 10-K, Omission of Information by Certain Wholly Owned Subsidiaries.\nItem 11.
