Actual results may differ from those estimates . We do not have any significant interests in any variable interest entities of which we are the primary beneficiary . Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform with the current presentation .\n Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on related sales . Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given period, can be affected by the mix of products sold . Historically, sales return provisions have amounted to less than  1% of gross product sales .\n Other revenues consist primarily of royalty income and corporate partner revenues .

Contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with a business combination, including the assumption of an acquiree’s liability arising from an acquisition it consummated prior to our acquisition .\n The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative has been formally designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship under the applicable accounting standards .

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value .\n We review our property, plant and equipment assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable . Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease terms . Goodwill and other intangible assets are recorded at cost, net of accumulated amortization and, if applicable, impairment charges .\n The eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition . Adverse clinical trial results, significant delays in obtaining marketing approval, the inability to bring a product to market and the introduction or advancement of competitors’ products could result in partial or full impairment of the related intangible assets .\n The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translation of the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in AOCI .

The estimated fair value of the acquired inventory was determined using the comparative sales method, which uses actual or expected selling prices of inventory as the base amount to which adjustments for selling effort and a profit on the buyer’s effort are applied . The excess of the . acquisition date consideration over the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed of $3.1 .billion was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes .\n The unaudited supplemental pro forma results of a hypothetical combined entity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, as if the acquisition of Horizon had occurred on January 1, 2022 (in millions) Amgen. incurred approximately $487.485 million of acquisition costs related to the closing of our Horizon acquisition. These costs were included primarily in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income .\n The unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company, nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition . The acquisition, which was accounted for as a business combination, includes TAVNEOS, an orally administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor .\n The $3.9 billion total consideration consisted of (i) a 3.7 billion cash payment to outstanding common stockholders of ChemoCentryx . The developed-product-technology rights acquired relates to TAVNEOS, approved in the U.S. and EU for ANCA-associated vasculitis . The estimated fair value of $2.5 billion was determined by using a multi-period excess earnings income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value .\n The company sold its shares in Gensenta, a subsidiary in Turkey, to Eczacıbaşı for net cash proceeds . The transaction was accounted for as a sale of a business and did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations .

As of December 31, 2024,    future grants and/or issuances of up to approximately  around 59 million shares of our common stock .\n The weighted-average grant date fair values per unit of RSUs granted (excluding replacement awards granted to Horizon RSU holders) during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were $301301.36.36-36.70-2023 .

The Company decided to establish a deferred tax on foreign earnings .\n The valuation allowance increased in 2024, primarily driven by the Company’s expectation that certain state R&D credits will expire unused . d to the extent foreign earnings can be distributed without a significant tax cost . The amount considered to be indefinitely reinvested is not practicable to determine the amount of the related deferred income tax liability due to the complexities of the tax laws .\n The company had $1.1 billion of foreign NOL carryforwards available to reduce future foreign income taxes . The remainder will expire between 2025 and 2034 . All of the UTBs as of December 31, 2024, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As a result, we remeasured our UTBs accordingly.\n The Company's effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, differ from the federal statutory rate . Substantially all of the benefit to our effective tax rate from foreign earnings results from locations where the Company has significant manufacturing operations, including Singapore, Ireland and Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for tax purposes .\n In the United States, this income tax qualifies for foreign tax credits . We accounted for the 2022 excise tax that was capitalized in Inventories as an expense in Cost of sales when the related products were sold in the first half of 2023, and a foreign tax credit was not recognized with respect to the excise tax expense in 2023 .

We disagreed with the proposed adjustments and calculations and pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office but were unable to reach resolution .\n The Company expects a decision from the Tax Court no earlier than 2026 . The IRS may also seek to continue to audit similar issues related to the allocation of income between the U.S. and Puerto Rico for years beyond 2018 . The ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact .\n The computations for basic and diluted EPS were as follows (in millions, except per-share data): For each of the three years ended December 31, 2024, the number of antidilutive employee stock-based awards excluded from the computation of diluted EPS was not significant .

Cash and cash equivalents in the above table excludes bank account cash of $487,487 and $540,000 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively .\n We relinquished our right to appoint a director to the BeiGene’s Board of Directors . We no longer have the ability to exert significant influence over BeiGene. The fair value of equity securities acquired exceeded our proportionate share of the carrying value of the underlying net assets, we began amortizing the intangible assets that gave rise to this basis difference over their useful lives .\n Amgen may only sell its BeiGene equity investment via a registered public offering or a private sale exempt from registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 .
