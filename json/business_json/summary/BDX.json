  "item1_summary": " BD Alaris™ Infusion System devices in the U.S. market are being remediated or replaced with the updated 510(k) cleared version . The timing and cost of replacement or remediation may be impacted by, among other things, customer readiness, supply continuity, and our continued engagement with the FDA . The European Union has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation, each of which impose stricter requirements .\n The nature of our technologies and data-driven solutions amplifies privacy and data protection risks, especially as we employ could-based infrastructures, AI and other emerging digital capabilities . Non-compliance by third-party vendors, manufacturers, or service providers could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to EU conformity requirements .\n Cybersecurity incidents, system failures, or breaches involving our own infrastructure or that of our partners may trigger regulatory scrutiny, financial penalties, business interruption, reputational harm, loss of competitive advantage and customer trust . Future changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws could materially impact our effective tax rate, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows .\n Many of our businesses rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property assets . Recall could result in the establishment or increase in financial reserves, loss of sales and customers . Patents attained by competitors may not provide us with any competitive advantage . We may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, we may be precluded from filing a patent application in any such country .\n The loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition or cash flows . We operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries .\n We depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments . However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control . If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, through the raising of additional capital or otherwise, we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital .\n The proposed combination of our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions Solutions business with Waters may not be completed, on the currently contemplated timeline or at all . Failure to comply with financial covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations . The transaction is expected to close around the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2026 .\n The announcement and pendency of the combination of our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters could cause disruptions in our business . A failure to complete the transaction, or a delay in doing so, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . We have already incurred and expect to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with the separation and combination .\n An inability to realize tsome or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction, as well as any delays encountered in the process, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . If the transaction is ultimately determined to be taxable, this could result in significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities for us and our shareholders .\n Natural disasters, public health crises, war and other events beyond our control could disrupt our business . The integration of any newly-acquired business requires significant effort and management attention . The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity .\n The following is a list of the executive officers of BD as of September 30, 2025, their ages and all positions and offices held by each of them during the past five years . There is no family relationship between any executive officer or director of BD. The list includes Thomas Polen, Thomas E. Polen and Roland Goette .\n BD’s cybersecurity risk management program is focused on maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of BD products, manufacturing and distribution operational technology (“OT”), enterprise IT and BD data . We proactively monitor for suspicious activity and perform risk assessments, penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities .\n BD provides mandatory quarterly cybersecurity awareness training tailored to associates’ and contractors’ role-based responsibilities . We send phishing simulation emails monthly to all users with a BD email address and an assigned computing device . We also use tools to monitor the sharing of personal, confidential and proprietary information to detect intentional or unintentional exfiltration from BD systems .\n BD’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) conforms to internationally recognized cybersecurity standards . In 2022, BD achieved ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification at the enterprise level . In 2025, BD engaged a third-party auditor to complete its third enterprise-level audit for ISO 27001, which determined that BD continues to meet these rigorous standards .\n This program includes supplier cybersecurity vetting at onboarding, and cybersecurity risk assessments, remediation, and cyber vulnerability monitoring while in-use, and deeper dive cyber risk assessments and security compliance . There can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent, mitigate or remediate cybersecurity incidents or breaches . We remain focused on continuous improvement through intelligence sharing with industry groups ."
