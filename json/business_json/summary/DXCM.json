  "item1_summary": " If we experience decreasing prices for our products and we are unable to reduce our expenses, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . Most of our customers rely on third-party payors, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to cover the cost of the G6, G7 and Dexcom One .\n The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services provides coverage for “Therapeutic Continuous Glucose Monitors” as durable medical equipment eligible for coverage under Medicare Part B . Medicare reimbursement for our CGM devices is subject to various coverage conditions and often requires a patient-specific coverage analysis . Medicare does not cover any items or services that are not “reasonable and necessary”\n We face a number of regulatory and commercial hurdles relating to wide-scale sales where a government or commercial third-party payor provides reimbursement, including sales to Medicare beneficiaries . If we are unable to successfully address these hurdles, reimbursement of our products may be limited to a smaller subset of people with diabetes covered by Medicare .\n CGM devices used by people with diabetes are generally reimbursable for all or part of the product cost by Medicare or other third-party payors . CMS has adopted coverage guidelines for CGMs, which could have a favorable impact on us . The commercial success of our products in both domestic and international markets will depend on whether timely and comprehensive reimbursement is widely available for individuals that use them .\n CMS published a final rule expanding the classification of DME under Medicare Parts B & C to include adjunctive CGMs . This final rule expanded coverage of CGMs to include competing devices, which may continue to have a negative impact on our sales as a result of increased market competition . We are unable to predict what effect the current or any future healthcare reform will have on our business .\n People without coverage who have diabetes may not use our products . Payors are increasingly basing reimbursement rates on factors such as prior approvals and the effectiveness of the product, clinical outcomes associated with the product . Government-mandated coverage requirements and other controls could impact access to and affordability of our products. As we continue to expand internationally, these government controls will have an increasing effect on our business and results of operations .\n The development of new products, or novel technologies and services and the enhancement of our current CGM products is difficult, expensive and time-consuming . The results of our product development and commercialization efforts may be affected by a range of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products . We may not be able to generate significant future revenues or profits from these efforts .\n The development and commercial launch timelines for our products depend a great deal on our ability to achieve clinical endpoints and satisfy regulatory requirements and to overcome technology challenges . Even if a product receives marketing authorization from the FDA or comparable international regulator, it may not be accepted in the marketplace by health care professionals, people with diabetes and those seeking to optimize metabolic health .\n We have entered into collaborations with several organizations that are currently using, or are developing, programs for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes that utilize our current CGM systems . As a result of these relationships, our operating results depend on the ability of our partners to successfully commercialize their insulin delivery systems or monitoring products .\n We expect that sales of our CGM systems will account for substantially all of our product revenue for the foreseeable future . If and when we receive FDA or other regulators’ marketing authorization for, and begin commercialization of, our next-generation CGM system, we expect most patients will migrate onto those systems . Our customers’ anticipation of the release of those products may cause them to cancel, change or delay current period purchases .\n Dexcom One, Dexcom G6, G7, and Stelo systems are more invasive than many other self-monitored glucose testing systems . People with diabetes may need to incur the costs of single-point finger stick devices, in addition to our systems . The relative immaturity of the CGM market internationally, and limited international reimbursement of CGM systems .\n People with diabetes may be unwilling to insert a sensor in their body, especially for those with diabetes if their current diabetes management involves no more than two finger sticks per day . Health care professionals may not recommend or prescribe our products unless and until (i) there is more long-term clinical evidence to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods, (ii) there are additional recommendations from prominent physicians that our products are effective in monitoring glucose levels .\n If we fail to produce sufficient amount of our CGM systems, we may be unable to meet market demand . We have had to limit back-order of our products to meet the needs of our customers . We are concerned that this may lead to a shortage of CGM products in the U.S. and other countries .\n We may not adequately predict the market demand for our products, which may lead us to produce our products in the quantities we anticipate will be necessary to meet actual market demand . We may have to modify our manufacturing design, reliability and process for next-generation products that may be approved, cleared or otherwise authorized by the applicable regulatory body and commercialized . We completed the initial phase of construction of our new facility in Malaysia and commenced commercial manufacturing in 2023 .\n Our ability to scale manufacturing capacity is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and may lead to variability in product quality or reliability . Our facilities are subject to inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and international agencies on an ongoing basis, and we must comply with Good Manufacturing Practices . We may be unable to adequately maintain, develop and expand our manufacturing process and operations .\n Manufacturing difficulties and/or any disruption at our facilities may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales, and increase our expenses . Problems with these manufacturing processes may not be detectable by us in a timely manner, could lead to product defects or manufacturing failures, resulting in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims or insufficient inventory, any of which could negatively impact our sales .\n A natural or man-made disaster, such as fire, flood, earthquake, act of terrorism, cyber-attack or other disruptive event, could cause substantial delays in our operations . Earthquakes are of particular significance since our manufacturing facilities in California are located in an earthquake-prone area . Wildfires are also increasingly common in southern California and present risk to our manufacturing operations .\n We purchase many of the components, materials and services needed to manufacture these products from numerous suppliers in various countries . We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such materials, components and services . However, we also rely on single and/or sole sources for certain components and materials used in manufacturing . Our manufacturers and suppliers may also encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons .\n Our reliance on outside manufacturers and suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business . We may experience a reduction or interruption in supply, and may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms . We are not a major customer of many of our suppliers, and these suppliers may give other customers’ needs higher priority than ours .\n We may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our single-source supplies . Switching components may require product redesign and submission to the FDA or international regulator of new applications (such as new 510(k) submissions or PMA supplements) which could significantly delay production . We also outsource certain services to other parties, including inside sales, certain transaction processing, accounting, information technology, manufacturing, and other areas .\n If any supplier, service provider or business partner violates laws or implements unethical practices, there could be disruptions to our supply chain, cancellation of our orders, a termination of the relationship with the partner or damage to our reputation . If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, our future revenue may be reduced and our business may be harmed .\n The company says it will continue to manage its sales, marketing, training and education programs that educate health care professionals, including physicians and patients . The company has also entered into distribution arrangements to leverage existing distributors (including wholesalers) in the distribution of drugs, devices and/or products in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East .\n Certain of our distribution agreements generated 10% or more of our total revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 . We cannot guarantee that these relationships will continue or that we will be able to maintain this volume of sales from these relationships in the future . A substantial decrease or loss of these sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial results .\n The market for glucose monitoring devices is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change . FDA or other regulatory approval of a commercially viable continuous glucose monitor or sensor produced by one of our competitors could significantly reduce market acceptance of our systems . Our products are based on our proprietary technology, but a number of companies and medical researchers are pursuing new technologies for the monitoring of glucose levels .\n Several companies are developing and/or commercializing products for continuous or periodic monitoring of glucose levels in the interstitial fluid under the skin that compete directly with our products . We have competed with Abbott for several years and their Libre family of CGM products. Medtronic markets and sells one or more standalone glucose monitoring products both internationally and in the United States.\n We are aware of the increasing use of GLP-1 products for the treatment of obesity and Type 2 diabetes . These treatments could potentially compete with our CGM systems and reduce sales of our products . We are subject to risks associated with public health issues, including pandemics, which could have a material adverse effect on our business .\n Our operations in countries outside the United States, which accounted for approximately 28% of our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, are accompanied by certain financial and other risks . Public health issues and crises may adversely impact our customers and/or their businesses due to lockdowns, labor shortages, lost access to private health insurance plans or modified spending priorities .\n Our profitability and international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs . Our international expansion efforts, including our new manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and facility under construction in Ireland, may not be successful . We may experience difficulties in scaling these functions from locations outside the United States and may not experience the expected cost efficiencies .\n The overall impact of such legislation in European Union member states is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by any laws impacting our tax rate . Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may reduce the reported value of our foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, and cash flows . The U.K. and E.U. agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that was ratified by the parties in May 2021 .\n The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the . Department of . Industry and . Commerce administer certain laws and regulations that restrict . U.K. goods no longer benefit from the free movement of goods and there is no longer the free . movement of people between the U.k. and the . E.U. single market . Violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties .\n Failure to comply with U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions . Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies .\n Current uncertainty in global economic and political conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters . Government agencies may seek to hold us liable for successor liability for anti-corruption law violations committed by any companies in which we invest or that we acquire . Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities .\n The pressure on consumers to absorb more of their own health care costs has resulted in some cases in higher deductibles and limits on durable medical equipment . A recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event could materially and adversely affect our access to capital on favorable terms or at all, our business and the value of our common stock . Failure to obtain any required regulatory authorization in international jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products abroad .\n We may not obtain international regulatory authorizations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all . Obtaining a marketing authorization from the FDA does not ensure authorization or approval by regulatory authorities in other countries will follow . The FDA may refuse to issue a Certificate to Foreign Government if significant compliance-related concerns are identified .\n U.S. state laws require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a breach involving personal information . Penalties for failure to adequately protect personal information vary by state law . Class action against individuals who experience a data breach is also common, and fines are often imposed by state laws that are often time consuming and expensive .\n As our customer base grows to include U.S. federal government agencies, we may also need to comply with Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program and Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification requirements . International data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the United States . Legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in wa\n In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, such as our proprietary business information and that of our clients, contractors, vendors and others . The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations . Despite our security measures and business controls, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers .\n Dexcom uses personnel and contractors located outside of the United States to perform certain functions . The use of offshore resources could be a violation of a legal or contractual requirement, which could result in termination of the contractual relationship, penalties, or changes in our business operations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations .\n Violations of HIPAA may result in criminal and civil penalties . HIPAA establishes a federal ‘floor’ with respect to privacy, security, and breach notification requirements . HITECH: We follow and maintain a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, but there can be no assurance that OCR will agree .\n California enacted the CCPA, which came into effect January 1, 2020, was amended and expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act (the \"CPRA\") The CCPA creates data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides privacy rights to California residents . The effects of these laws have required us to modify our data processing practices, and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply .\n In the European Union, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in May 2018 . Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities . Data transfer risk remains a potential issue as certain Data Protection Authorities continue to raise concerns about the transfer of data to the United States .\n Dexcom may see more stringent state and federal privacy legislation in the future . Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could result in the compromise of confidential data or critical data systems and give rise to potential harm to customers, remediation and other expenses . Cyber threats are becoming more frequent, sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access data .\n The secure maintenance of this information and technology is critical to our business operations . We have implemented and deploy multiple layers of security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data . Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents .\n The hybrid workplace does, however, introduce additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk . Cyberattacks have become more prevalent and harder to detect and defend against . These threats can come from a variety of sources, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and malfeasance by employees, contractors, or other insiders .\n Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our contractors, may be vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, malfeasance, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption . Third-party vendors may experience security incidents of varying severity, including but not limited to increased ransomware attacks, network intrusions, and unauthorized data exfiltration .\n Insurance also provides coverage in relation to regulatory action defense including oversight, investigations and disclosure obligations . However, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered and/or may exceed the amount of any coverage . Cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices remain a priority for us .\n Failure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyberattacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results . We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements .\n Computer viruses, viruses, cyber attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware or other malware, attacks by hackers (including nation states or state-sponsored organizations) If our systems are breached or suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may significantly suffer and we may be subject to litigation, government enforcement actions .\n Medical devices are increasingly connected to the internet, hospital networks, and other medical devices to provide features that improve healthcare . These same features may also increase cybersecurity risks and the risks of unauthorized access and use by third parties . Cyberattacks aimed at accessing our devices, products, and services could impact the quality-of-care patients receive or the confidentiality of patient information .\n The healthcare industry generally, and our business specifically, is subject to extensive international, federal, state and local laws and regulations . If we fail to comply with applicable laws and government regulations, we could become subject to penalties, be excluded from participation in government programs, and/or be required to make significant changes to our operations .\n The laws and regulations governing medical devices are complex and often not fully understood . They could be subject to fines, exclusion from participation in certain programs . The risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the courts, such as the FDA, OCR and other agencies .\n FDA and FTC share oversight of medical device promotion . FDA has broad authority over device marketing . FTC has authority over “advertising” for most medical devices, such as ours . Any action against us alleging a violation of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s time and attention from the operation of our business .\n In 2024, there were 60 AI-related regulations at the U.S. federal and state levels, up from just one in 2016 . The EU AI Act went into effect on August 1, 2024, which sets requirements for developers and deployers of AI systems based on a risk approach . A review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities may result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations .\n The FDA’s Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulations require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury . The FDA may also decide to recall a product voluntarily if we find a material deficiency . Recalls of our products could divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our reputation .\n Failure by us or one of our suppliers or distributors to comply with statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, competent authorities and other regulatory bodies could result in, among other things, any of the following actions . The potential effect of these events can in some cases be difficult to quantify, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer .\n Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products could lead to recalls or safety alerts, reputational harm, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . Failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as the QSR, MDR reporting, or other post-market requirements may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes .\n Product or component failures, manufacturing nonconformances, design defects, off-label use, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks . These problems could lead to recalls, corrections or removals of, or issuance of, a safety alert relating to, our products, and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits . The production of our products must occur in a highly controlled and clean environment .\n Complications from use of our products may include sensor errors, sensor failures, broken or detached sensor wires, or skin irritation under the adhesive dressing of the sensor . Inflammation or redness, swelling, minor infection, and minor bleeding at the sensor insertion site are also possible risks with an individual’s use .\n The FDA's classification of our G6 system under the generic name “integrated continuous glucose monitoring system” makes it a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions . The PMA process requires us to prove the safety and effectiveness of our systems to the FDA’s satisfaction. This process can be expensive, prolonged and uncertain, requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and human clinical data .\n We intend to seek 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals for certain changes and modifications to our existing software platform, but cannot predict when, if ever, those changes will be approved . Future generations of our CGM systems may not be cleared or approved for the indications necessary or desirable for successful commercialization . The uncertain timing of regulatory approvals for future generati is uncertain .\n Failure to comply with laws, regulations and contract requirements relating to reimbursement of health care goods and services could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows . We have in place a compliance program, through which we seek to reduce common industry risks of noncompliance with U.S. federal and state and applicable international laws .\n The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical . The principal U.S. federal laws relating to reimbursement include those that prohibit (i) the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment . Insurance companies can also bring a private cause of action claiming treble damages against a manufacturer for causing a false claim to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act .\n Some arrangements may implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute and are not covered by a safe harbor . Allegations of violations of the law can also trigger liability under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law and federal civil False Claims Act . An arrangement that fits squarely into an exception or safe harbor will not be deemed to violate the law .\n Violations of the Stark Law create overpayment liability under the federal civil False Claims Act . Certain Stark Law violations can also trigger exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs . Managed care trends and consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations . Private third-party payors and other managed care organizations are taking action to manage utilization and control costs .\n Failure to obtain or maintain timely adequate pricing or favorable formulary placement for our products could adversely impact revenue . Private third-party payors, including self-insured employers, often implement formularies with co-payment tiers to encourage utilization of certain products . As the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants may become more intense .\n If we are unable to successfully complete the pre-clinical studies or clinical trials necessary to support additional PMA, de novo, or 510(k) applications or supplements, we may be unable to commercialize our CGM systems under development, which could impair our business, financial condition and operating results . Product development is a long, expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays and failure at any stage .\n Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products . The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of FDA marketing applications or supplements . Medical device company stock prices have declined significantly in certain circumstances where companies failed to meet expectations in regards to the timing of regulatory approval .\n The FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol, or place clinical trials on hold . Patients experience adverse side effects, even though their death may not be related to our products . Third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or the study that the FDA deems to make the study results unreliable .\n The results of pre-clinical studies or other forms of early product testing do not necessarily predict future clinical trial results . Health epidemics could limit or restrict our ability to initiate, conduct or continue our clinical trials . We depend on clinical investigators and cli. rable as to safety or efficacy; and the FDA concludes that the results from our trial and/or trial design are inadequate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the product .\n We rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials, and other third parties to manage the trials and to perform related data collection and analysis . We may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that clinical sites may devote to our trials . If these parties fail to perform as expected, our trials could be delayed or terminated . Health care policy changes, including health care reform legislation, may have a material adverse effect .\n In response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and regulators to control these costs . Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products . The revised Code, effective June 2022, addressed concerns noted in the OIG’s Special Fraud Alert, addressing things like virtual meetings, speaker programs and alcohol at events .\n The Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, imposes certain stringent compliance, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements on companies in various sectors of the life sciences industry . We cannot predict what additional new legislation, agency priorities, and rulemaking may be on the horizon .\n Future significant changes in healthcare systems in the United States or elsewhere could also have a negative impact on the demand for our current and future products . We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that may relate to aspects of our business . We cannot be certain that we have not infringed the intellectual property rights of such third parties or others .\n There are numerous issued patents and pending patent applications relating to self-monitored glucose testing systems in the medical technology field . We have in the past settled some such allegations and may need to do so again in the future . In December 2024, we entered into a Settlement and License Agreement with Abbott to settle all pending patent infringement legal proceedings brought by Abbott against us .\n elevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we could be prohibited from selling any of our products that is found to infringe . We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement . A court could order us to pay damages to compensate the patent owner for the infringement .\n Patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements . Costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and would likely include ongoing royalties . A court could order us to pay statutory damages, actual damages, or profits . Failure to obtain necessary intellectual property licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business .\n There can be no assurance that existing or future legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations . Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete .\n A court could hold that some or all of our asserted intellectual property rights are not infringed, or are invalid or unenforceable . Third parties may be able to design around our patents . We face the risk of product liability claims and may be subject to damages, fines, penalties and injunctions, among other things .\n We may be subject to product liability claims if our products cause, or merely appear to have caused, an injury . Claims may be made by customers, healthcare providers or others selling our products . G6 and G7 do not require confirmatory finger sticks when making treatment decisions or finger stick tests each day for calibration .\n G6 and G7 are designed to be used by an individual continuously for up to 10 days, but the individual might be able to circumvent the safeguards designed into the systems and use the products for longer than 10 days . Off-label use of products by customers is common, and any such use of our products could subject us to additional liability .\n “whistleblower” suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government . Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions . Any resolution of any such investigations could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations .\n Our marketing, promotional and educational materials and practices are subject to FDCA, Federal Trade Commission Act, and other applicable laws and regulations . We may be subject to fines, penalties and injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or improper off-label uses or determined to have made claims that are untruthful or misleading .\n We are not actively promoting our G6 or G7 systems for inpatient use, but if we supply them to such facilities in the future, this supply could present an increased risk of product liability claims and associated damages should an adverse event occur . The FDA applies a heightened level of scrutiny to comparative claims when applying its statutory standards for advertising and promotion .\n Such a suit may seek injunctive relief against further advertising, a court order directing corrective advertising, and compensatory and punitive damages where permitted by law . We expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our clinical trials and other development activities related to our products, including our next-generation sensors, transmitters and receivers, as well as other collaborations .\n Our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain our personnel and manage our human capital, while controlling labor costs . The loss of a member of our senior management or our professional staff would require the remaining executive officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement . Competition for senior management personnel, as well as salespersons, scientists, clinicians, engineers and other highly skilled personnel is intense .\n There is intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel in areas of our activities . If we fail to identify, attract, retain and motivate these skilled personnel, we may be unable to continue our development and commercialization activities . We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on commercialization of our products .\n The amount of funding we may need will depend on many factors, including: revenue generated by sales of our products and other future products . Costs, timing and risks of delay of additional regulatory approvals, such as the emergence of competing or complementary technologies . Any additional financing may be dilutive to stockholders or may require us to grant a lender a security interest in our assets .\n The primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding . We may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts, as a result of increases in the adoption of plan structures .\n Current economic conditions, including relatively high interest rates, inflation and potential economic slowdowns, as well as our business decisions, may reduce the value of some of our assets . We also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in the international expansion of our sales efforts and the build-out of our manufacturing facility in Malaysia and the construction of a new facility in Ireland .\n We may not realize the anticipated benefit of our acquisitions, or the realization of the anticipated benefits may require greater expenditures than anticipated by us . If we fail to successfully integrate other companies, products or technologies that we acquire, our business could be harmed . We may have to incur debt or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquis .\n Compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, new SEC regulations and Nasdaq Stock Market listing rules . Compliance with these laws and regulations, including enhanced new disclosures, has required and will continue to require substantial management time and oversight . Changes to existing accounting rules or standards may adversely impact our reported financial results .\n We could be subject to changes in our tax rates, new U.S. or international tax legislation or additional tax liabilities . The tax laws in the United States and in other countries in which we and our subsidiaries do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial condition .\n The OECD has published a package of measures for reform of the international tax rules as a product of its BEPS initiative . Many of the initiatives in the BEPS package require amendments to the domestic tax legislation of various jurisdictions . The European Union is asserting that a number of country-specific tax regimes and rulings in certain member states may violate, or have violated, European Union law .\n On October 8, 2021, the OECD announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS which agreed to a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy . (iv) a one-time tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets, with the latter taxed at a lower rate .\n Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations which could subject our business to higher tax liability . We may be limited in the portion of NOL carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, and federal tax credits to offset federal tax liabilities .\n There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes or changes to federal or state law, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, could expire or otherwise be unavailable . The State of California also passed S.B. 175 to provide for a potential early sunset of N.OLs in either 2025 or 2026 .\n Our stock price is highly volatile and investing in our stock involves a high degree of risk, which could result in substantial losses for investors . Historically, the market price of our common stock fluctuates and could continue to be volatile in the future, especially as our business continues to grow and our business plan continues to evolve . The market price is influenced by many factors that are beyond our control, including the ongoing international conflicts, recessions, rising interest rates, inflation, local and national elections, international currency fluctuations, and other factors .\n The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of companies in our industry . Securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which could seriously harm our business . Corruption, political instability and acts of war or terrorism could reduce the market price of our stock .\n We do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future . Delaware law could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock . Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that might otherwise be beneficial to stockholders .\n The Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder . Federal district courts of the United States will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under Securities Act .\n The exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees . Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company .Increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability .\n As of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings, $7.7 million in outstanding letters of credit, and a total available balance of $192.3 million under the Amended Credit Agreement . We believe we will have the ability to service our debt, extend the term of the credit agreement, and/or obtain additional resources in the future .\n In May 2020, we completed an offering of approximately $1.21 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.25% senior convertible notes due 2025, or 2025 Notes, which offering we refer to as the 2020 Notes Offering .
