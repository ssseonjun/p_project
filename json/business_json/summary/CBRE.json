Demand was particularly strong for the highest quality space and expanded from primary to secondary markets as the year progressed .\n The following presents highlights of CBRE’s performance for the year ended December 31, 2024 (percentages represent comparison to 2023 results): . An improved operating environment supported strong growth for CBRE in 2024 . Overall, net revenue increased 14.2%. This included 14.1% net revenue growth in our resilient businesses (including facilities management, project management, property management, and recurring investment management fees)\n CBRE Group, Inc. reported $1,036 2.9 billion in net income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, less than $2.2 billion in cash and interest income . Net income from non-concesscesscessed subsidiaries: $1.036,036,000-1,000,000 less than the $9.1 billion we reported for the year of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions): $2,000-$1,400,000 .\n The revenue increase reflected growth in leasing activity, particularly for office and retail space, commercial mortgage origination, loan servicing, property management, and continued strong growth in the GWS segment . Foreign currency translation strength in the British pound sterling was offset by weakness in the Japanese yen . Cost of revenue increased slightly to 80.6% of total revenue from 80.4% driven by higher costs to support growth in revenues .\n Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 8.4% during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023 . Gain on disposition of real estate increased by $115 million in 2024 . Other income decreased to $39 million from $61 million, driven primarily by a one-time gain of approximately $34 million .\n The Organization for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD) Pillar Two Model Rules established a minimum global effective tax rate of 15% on country-by-country profits of large multinational companies . The impact of Pillar Two top-up taxes was insignificant for 2024 .

The following table summarizes our results of operations for our Advisory Services operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 .\n Global leasing revenue rose 12.2% driven by the Americas which grew 13.3%, including 15.8% in the United States, APAC which grew 10.6% and the United Kingdom . Property sales revenue was up 10.1%, reflecting an increase in property sales in the second half of 2024 . Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on total revenue in 2024, primarily driven by weakness in the Japanese yen and Brazilian real .\n Foreign currency translation had a 0.2% positive impact on total operating expenses . Lower restructuring expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring expenses as the Advisory Services segment recorded significant restructuring expenses in the first half of 2023, as the segment went through cost reduction initiatives that did not recur this year . MSRs contributed $123 million to operating income, offset by $138 million of amortization of related intangible assets .\n The following table summarizes our results of operations for our Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions) The GWS operating segment's net revenue decreased 5.9% primarily due to lower amortization of mortgage servicing rights as described above and due to accelerated depreciation expense recorded in first half of 2023 .\n Revenue increased 11.7% in 2024 as compared to 2023, reflecting a double-digit increase in facilities management, led by the Enterprise and Local business .

The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost . The following table summarizes our results of operations for our Corporate and other segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 .\n In 2024, operating, administrative and other expenses for our core corporate function rose 57.5%, to $723 million in 2024, mainly due to an increase in our provision related to indirect taxes, increased charges associated with employee separation and integration and other costs related to acquisitions . In addition, we recorded higher incentive compensation expense reflecting improved business performance .\n Our expected capital requirements for 2025 include up to $360 million of anticipated capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions . As of December 31, 2024, we had $3.3 billion of borrowings available under our revolving credit facilities (under both the Revolving Credit Agreement, as described below) and the Turner & Townsend revolving credit facility . We have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and general investment requirements .\n Our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facilities would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months . We may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive .\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had accrued deferred purchase consideration totaling $292 million ($199 million of which was a current liability) and $530 million ($530 million) in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” and “Other long-term liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report . We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms .\n The timing of any future repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions . We had an estimated liability of approximately $204 million (of which $102 million was current) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the remediation efforts .\n The estimated remediation costs for in-scope buildings are subjective, highly complex and dependent on a number of variables outside of Telford Homes’ control . We will continue to assess new information as it becomes available during the remediation process and adjust our estimated liability accordingly . The estimated liability is based on additional information obtained and evaluations performed allowing for a more refined estimate .\n The increased outflow was primarily driven by higher payments of deferred purchase consideration, share repurchase, and taxes on equity awards . e acquisition of J&J Worldwide Services in February 2024 and Direct Line Global in June 2024 . The increased cash used in financing activities totaled $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 .\n The majority of this balance represents our warehouse lines of credit, which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets, Inc. The notes have either fixed or variable interest rates, roused to fixed interest rates . We estimate that we will make $918 million of interest payments, $164 million of which will be made in 2025 .\n As of December 31, 2024, we have a remaining federal tax liability of $30 million associated with the Transition Tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 .

The proceeds from issuances under the program may be used for general corporate purposes .\n Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts . Understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time, amount, and method to recognize revenue for each transaction requires significant judgement . We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used .\n Our revenues subject to the most judgment are sales and lease commission revenue, incentive-based management fees, development fees and third party fees associated with our occupier outsourcing and property management services . As of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheets included goodwill of $5.6 billion and other intangible assets of $2.3 billion .\n Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities . Management’s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the  assumptions for  the  value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded . We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment with respect to any of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible  assets .\n We did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2024 annual impairment tests, as it was determined that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets were substantially in excess of their carrying values as of December 31, 2024 . For additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing, see Note 2–– Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9– Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements .\n Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized . The ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements . We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards .\n The estimates were developed using the best available data, including industry data, fire safety assessments, and bids from subcontractors . We applied an inflation factor to account for uncertainty in completion of remediation activities, which could take an extended period of time to complete, an estimate of direct costs associated with an internal team dedicated to this remediation . Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to its subjective, highly complex nature .\n Non-GAAP measures are not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States . These measures are used to provide a more complete understanding of the company's financial results . The company uses these measures to evaluate its performance and for other discretionary purposes . See New Accounting Pronouncements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this year's Annual Report .\n Net revenue is gross revenue less costs associated with subcontracted vendor work performed for clients and is passed through to the client generally with no margin . Segment operating profit on net revenue margin is a better indicator of the segment’s margin since it does not include the diluting effect of pass-through revenue . Core EBITDA, core adjusted net income and core earnings per share (or core EPS) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies .\n Core EBITDA, core adjusted net income and core EPS are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments . We believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry .\n Core net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders, as adjusted (or core adjusted net income), and core EPS, are calculated as follows (in millions, except share and per share data) Core EBITDA and core earnings per share are determined as follows: $2,704 $2.704 €2,209 €1,209$2,208 € Core net income (or adjusted) attributributions)\n Core net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., as adjusted, is calculated as follows (dollars in millions) Core diluted income per share is calculated at $5.10 per share .

The qualitative test is elective, and an entity can go directly to the quantitative test rather than making a more-likely-than-not assessment based on an evaluation of qualitative factors .\n We are the lessee in contracts for office space tenancies, for leased vehicles, and for some leases of land in our global development business . When estimating the fair value of acquired assets, we utilize various valuation models which may require significant judgment, particularly where observable market values do not exist .
