  "item1_summary": " Our revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates . We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flows from operations, and our available revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months .\n The decrease in cash provided by working capital was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue of $316 million driven by the transition of multi-year subscription contracts billed upfront to annual billing installments . The following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at January 31, 2025, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods .\n Purchasing obligations relate primarily to acquisition of cloud services, marketing and commitments related to our investment agreements with limited liability partnership funds . Operating leases consist primarily of obligations for real estate, vehicles, and certain equipment . Pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the United States . Purchasing and purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services .\n The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information . Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations . We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices exceeding our expected requirements for three months .\n Our stock repurchase programs provide us with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time . The pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations, available surplus, the volume of employee stock plan activity, remaining shares available in the authorized pool .\n Our revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates . As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements generally within one to 12 months . Contracts were primarily denominated in Euros, British pounds, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Singapore dollars, Australian dollars, Swiss francs, Norwegian krone, and Swedish Krona .\n A hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2025 and 2024, would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by $209 million and $121 million, respectively . At January 31, 2025, we had $1.32 billion of cash equivalents and marketable securities . Privately held company investments generally are considered inherently risky .\n The basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies . See Part II, Item 8, Note 3, “Financial Instruments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding these strategic investments . For information about exposure to counter-party credit-related losses, see Part II .\n The Company's net income is $1,061 per share . The company's net gain (loss) on derivative instruments (net of tax effect of $2, $6.19) and $3.78 per share is based on share per share average share per-share size . Total comprehensive income   $1.061-$857 per share.\n The company paid $10,833 $9,912 preferred stockholders' equity and $1,855 proceeded in consolidated cash flow flows from the fiscal year ended January 31, receiving financial statements of the company . The company's current liabilities include current liabilities, operating lease liabilities, accrued compensation and deferred income taxes .\n Investments, net of cash acquired, cash provided by operating activities: Purchases of marketable securities; Investing activities ; Sales of marketable securities; Maturities of marketable stock markets were purchases and investments ; . Cash flow disclosure: Cash paid for interest; cash paid for income taxes, net of tax refunds, tax refunds; Cash paid for interest received for interest; .\n See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . The financial statements are presented at the bottom of each page of the following page . The company provides a summary of the financial statements each of the company’s financial statements . The results of each company's operations will be determined at the end of each respective fiscal year .\n Autodesk, Inc. is a global leader in 3D design, engineering and entertainment technology solutions . The Company’s sophisticated software products, offered through a hybrid of desktop and cloud functionality, enable its customers to design, fabricate, manufacture, and build anything by visualizing, simulating, and analyzing real-world performance early in the design process .\n Autodesk changed presentation of the amortization of costs capitalized to obtain a contract with a customer in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . The Company also makes assumptions, judgments, and estimates in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, variable compensation, partner incentive programs, loss contingencies, and operating lease liabilities .\n Autodesk is a global leader in 3D design, engineering and entertainment technology solutions . The chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) assesses performance and decides how to allocate resources based on consolidated net income as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations . The measure of the Company’s segment assets is reported as total assets . The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources, evaluating financial performance .\n The CODM also uses the budget to actual comparisons of total net revenue and consolidated net income to make decisions aligned with Autodesk’s strategic initiatives and go-to market strategies . The amounts of new transaction model and stock-based compensation are excluded from this line and presented separately within this table .\n Autodesk’s revenue is divided into subscription revenue, maintenance revenue, and other revenue . Long-lived assets exclude deferred tax assets, marketable securities, goodwill, and intangible assets . The company's revenue is recognized when control for these offerings is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products and services .\n Judgment is required to determine the level of integration and interdependency between individual components of desktop software applications and cloud functionalities . This determination influences whether desktop software is considered distinct and accounted for separately as a license performance obligation recognized at the time of delivery . For product subscriptions and flexible EBA subscriptions, the single performance obligation is recognized ratably over the contract term as the subscription is delivered .\n Autodesk established the relative standalone selling price (SSP) of each obligation . Judgment is required to determine whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to pay, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers . The deferred costs are then amortized over the period of benefit .\n Commissions paid to our solution providers that are related to contract renewals may either be commensurate or non-commensurate with commissions earned on the initial contract . Costs for initial contracts that are non-commissioned on renewal contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit . Amortization expense is included in marketing and sales expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations .\n Key inputs for currency derivatives are spot rates, forward rates, interest rates, volatility, and credit default rates . Autodesk reviews for potential changes on a quarterly basis, in conjunction with our fiscal quarter-end close . The Company has elected to use the income approach to value derivatives using the observable Level 2 .\n Autodesk classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term generally based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date . The company's strategic investments consist of privately held debt and equity securities. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. The company carries all “trading securities” at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax .\n Autodesk's strategic investments in debt and equity securities (Level 3) are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market . The valuation requires the Company’s judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity . The fair value would then be adjusted positively or negatively based on available information such as pricing in recent rounds of financing .\n The credit loss is measured as the amount by which the debt security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected . Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding adjustment to “Interest and other expense, net”\n Autodesk uses derivative instruments to manage its short-term exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that exist as part of ongoing business operations . For additional information, see “Concentration of Credit Risk” within this Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and “Financial Instruments”\n Autodesk accounts for these derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and carries them at fair value . Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting . The bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose Autodek to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance .\n Autodesk uses foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions . The effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts is assessed quantitatively using regression at inception and thereafter . The gains and losses on these hedges are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”\n Autodesk uses foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to reduce exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, and cash . These forward contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each fiscal quarter with gains and losses recognized as “Interest and other income (expense), net”\n Autodesk has a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment of monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period . The majority of these incentives are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable and deferred revenue in the period the transaction is billed . Allowances for credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets were not material as of January 31, 2025 .\n Autodesk’s accounts receivable are derived from sales to a large number of resellers, distributors, and direct customers in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific (APAC) geographies . Citibank, N.A., an affiliate of Citigroup, is one of the lead lenders and an agent in the syndicate of a $1.5-billion revolving credit facility .\n Autodesk’s intangible assets include customer relationships, developed technologies, trade names and patents, and other, and the related accumulated amortization . These assets are presented as “Intangible assets, net” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets . Amortization expense for intangible assets was $134.2 billion in fiscal 2025, $89 million in fiscal 2024, and $298 million in fiscal 2023 .\n Computer equipment, software, furniture, leasehold improvements, land and buildings depreciated using straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets . Depreciation expense for intangible assets for each of the fiscal years ended thereafter is as follows:  depreciation expense was $.43.00 million in fiscal 2025, $47 million in  2024, and $.50 million in fiscal 2023 . Impairment losses were   in fiscal years  ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023.\n Autodesk enters into certain cloud-based software hosting arrangements that are accounted for as service contracts . Costs incurred for these arrangements are capitalized for application development activities, if material, and immediately expensed for preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities . Software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the period of general market availability of the products are generally amortized over a two-year period .\n Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term . Autodesk records the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their estimated fair values at the date of the respective acquisition, with the exception of contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue)\n The fair values assigned to the identifiable intangible assets acquired are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management . Autodesk records the excess of consideration transferred over the aggregate fair values as goodwill . The impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value . See Note 9, “Leases” for further discussion on impairment charges of lease related right-of-assets .\n Autodesk tests goodwill for impairment annually in its fourth fiscal quarter or more often . Goodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value . If impairment exists, the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations .\n The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024 . The value of the goodwill is based on the Company's valuation of assets and liabilities assumed . Autodesk performs a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets .\n Autodesk determines the grant date fair value of its stock-based payment awards for grants of employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model . The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved. is more likely than not to be realized.\n Autodesk uses the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards . The variables used in these models are reviewed when awards are granted and adjusted as needed . Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant . The expected volatility for performance stock units subject to market conditions includes the expected volatility of companies within the S&P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $2.0 billion .\n The risk-free interest rate used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model is the historical yield on U.S. Treasury securities with equivalent remaining lives . The funded status of Autodesk’s defined benefit pension plans is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for the fiscal years presented .\n There have been no recent changes in accounting pronouncements issued by FASB or adopted by the Company during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, that are applicable to the Company . The measurement of projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit obligations is based on estimates and assumptions that reflect the terms of the plans .\n FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures’s’ Disclosure requirements . Autodesk adopted the annual disclosures of ASU 20 23-07 for our fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 . ASU 2024-03 requires disaggregated disclosures of certain categories of expenses .\n In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures’s transparency and usefulness of income tax disclosures . Autodesk is currently evaluating the effect of adopting ASU 2024-03 on its disclosures .\n Autodesk does not have any material variable consideration, such as obligations for returns, refunds, warranties, or amounts due to customers for which significant estimation or judgment is required as of the reporting date .

They include corporate debt securities, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, and US treasury bonds . These investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Long-term other assets” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets .

The following table summarizes the fair values of investments classified as marketable . debt securities by contractual maturity date as of January 31, 2025: Fair Value (1) due within 1 year, (2) due in 1 year through 5 years, (5) through 10 years; (6) due after 10 years: (7) Average fair value (fair value)\n There were  no allowances for credit losses as of January 31, 2025 and 2024 . Realized gains and losses from the sale or redemption of marketable securities are recorded in “rewarded interest and other income (expense), net’s) on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations . Autodesk uses the measurement alternative to account for adjustment to these investments in a given quarter .\n Autodesk applies fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities, which consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and other financial instruments . The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date .Autodesk does not consider the remaining investments to be impaired as of January 31, 2025 .\n These investments are classified as debt securities .
