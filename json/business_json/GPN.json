    "item1": "Item 1 - Business\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nWe operate in two reportable segments: Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. During the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our Netspend business, which comprised our former Consumer Solutions segment. Our consolidated financial statements include the results of our former Consumer Solutions segment for periods prior to disposition. See \"Note 18—Segment Information\" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our segments.\nDiscussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 that have been omitted under this item can be found in \"Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2024. \n \n38\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Overview\n \nWe are a leading payments technology company delivering innovative software and services to our customers globally. Our technologies, services and team member expertise allow us to provide a broad range of solutions that enable our customers to operate their businesses more efficiently across a variety of channels around the world. \nWe have grown organically, as well as through acquisitions, and continue to invest in new technology solutions, infrastructure to support our growing business and the ongoing consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms. These investments include new product development and innovation to further enhance and differentiate our suite of technology and solutions available to customers, along with migration of certain underlying technology platforms to cloud environments to enhance performance, improve speed to market and drive cost efficiencies. We also continue to execute on integration and business transformation activities, such as combining business operations, streamlining technology infrastructure, eliminating duplicative corporate and operational support structures and realizing scale efficiencies. \nWe have furthered our business strategy through the following key transactions during 2024: \n•\nWe completed the sale of AdvancedMD, Inc. (\"AdvancedMD\") in December 2024 for approximately $1 billion, subject to certain closing adjustments, and up to $125 million contingent upon the purchaser achieving certain specified returns. AdvancedMD is a provider of software-as-a-service solutions to small-to-medium sized ambulatory physician practices in the United States and was included in our Merchant Solutions segment prior to disposition. We recognized a gain on the sale of $273.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n•\nOur capital structure initiatives during 2024 included the issuance of $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.500% convertible senior notes due March 2031 through a private placement. In connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions to hedge the potential dilutive effect upon conversion of the notes, or offset our cash obligation if the cash settlement option were to be elected, for amounts in excess of the principal amount of converted notes up to a cap price.\nHighlights related to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 include the following: \n•\nConsolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased to $10,105.9 million, compared to $9,654.4 million for the prior year. The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily due to growth in transaction volume. The year-over-year favorable effect on revenues from the EVO business acquired in March 2023 was offset by the unfavorable effect on revenues from the dispositions of our gaming and consumer businesses in April 2023.\n•\nMerchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions segment operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable effect of increases in revenues, as certain fixed costs do not vary with revenues. Merchant Solutions operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024 also reflected an increase related to the acquired EVO business, as the year ended December 31, 2023 only included the acquisition for a portion of the period. \n•\nConsolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024 included the favorable effects of the increase in revenues as compared to the prior year, as well as lower acquisition and integration expenses and share-based compensation expense. These favorable effects were offset by expenses related to business transformation activities, a technology asset charge and an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles, primarily related to the acquisition of EVO as discussed in further detail below. Consolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024 included the gain on the sale of AdvancedMD described above. Consolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023 included the effects of the gain on the sale of our gaming business and the loss on the sale of our consumer business.\n39\nTable of Contents\nStrategy and Business Transformation\nEarly in 2024, we launched a holistic review of our business to examine our strategy, operations and ability to deliver sustainable performance. We have refreshed our strategy and are focusing our resources, efforts and investments on the areas of the business that will drive the best opportunities for growth. \nThese strategic, organizational and operational transformation activities are expected to continue over the next few years. As we focus on executing and delivering transformation initiatives, we have incurred and anticipate incurring incremental expenses related to the transformation and potential additional asset impairment charges through early 2027. We are also undertaking a strategic review of our business portfolio to evaluate potential assets for disposition to further streamline our business and create value for shareholders.\nWe currently expect our transformation initiatives to generate more than $600 million of annual run-rate operating income benefit by the first half of 2027. Refer to \"Item 1 - Business\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this business transformation initiative.\nContinuing and Emerging Trends\nThe payments technology industry continues to evolve and grow worldwide and as a result, certain large payment technology companies, including us, have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures. We expect to continue to expand into new markets and pursue additional acquisitions and joint ventures in existing markets to increase our scale and improve our competitiveness.\nThe industry continues to grow globally as a result of wider merchant acceptance and increased use of credit and debit cards, advances in payment processing technology and migration to ecommerce, omnichannel and contactless payment solutions. The proliferation of credit and debit cards, as well as other digital payment solutions, has made the acceptance of digital payments a virtual necessity for many businesses, regardless of size, in order to remain competitive. Furthermore, the expanding digitization of the economy and availability and access to financial services increases the demand for cards and digital payment solutions, which in turn drives growth in acceptance and transaction volumes. We believe the increased use of cards and the availability of more sophisticated technology services to all market segments will continue to result in an increasingly competitive and specialized industry.\nThe use of digital payment solutions, the need for development of technologies and digital-based solutions and\n \nexpansion of ecommerce, omnichannel and contactless payment solutions has accelerated. We believe that the number of digital payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies. As a result, we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies, including technology modernization, innovation and integration through strategic partnerships.\nWe also believe new markets will continue to develop and expand in areas that have been previously dominated by paper-based transactions. We expect industries such as education, government and healthcare, as well as recurring payments and business-to-business (\"B2B\") payments, to continue to see transactions migrate to digital-based solutions. We anticipate that the continued development of new services and technologies, the emergence of new vertical markets and continued expansion of technology-enabled ecommerce and omnichannel solutions, including expanded scale and market reach through new innovative cloud-based capabilities and strategic partnerships, will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenues in the future. Furthermore, due to its benefits and growth potential, we anticipate the increased exploration of use of AI in the payments industry. \nFor a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our continuing operating results, see the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in",
    "item1a": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Combinations\nFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. The measurement principle for the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination is at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date, with certain exceptions. The excess of the total consideration transferred over the amount of the net identifiable assets acquired determined in accordance with the measurement guidance for such items is recognized as goodwill. \nThe estimates we use to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations, and we engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. The estimated fair values of customer-related and contract-based intangible assets are generally determined using the income approach, which is based on projected cash flows discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows. The discount rates used represent a risk adjusted market participant weighted-average cost of capital, derived using customary market metrics. These measures of fair value also require considerable judgments about future events, including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted customer attrition rates, contract renewal estimates and technology changes. Acquired technologies are generally valued using the replacement cost method, which requires us to estimate the costs to construct an asset of equivalent utility at prices available at the time of the valuation analysis, with adjustments in value for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence. Trademarks and trade names are generally valued using the \"relief-from-royalty\" approach. This method assumes that trademarks and trade names have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenues for the related asset, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted-average cost of capital. This measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trademark or trade name.\n53\nTable of Contents\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the period over which to recognize the amount of acquisition-related intangible assets as an expense. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.\nGoodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets are also regularly evaluated for impairment, which requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions as further described below. A\n change in estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually (in the fourth quarter) and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative assessment for impairment is necessary. The election of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit. Factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of our reporting units, events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units, our share price, and other relevant entity-specific events. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test would be required. \n When applying the quantitative assessment, we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques, principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach. The income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows, while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions\n.\nAs of October 1, 2024, our reporting units consisted of the following: North America Payments Solutions, Vertical Market Software Solutions, Europe Merchant Solutions, Spain Merchant Solutions, Asia-Pacific Merchant Solutions, Latin America Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. As of October 1, 2024, we performed a quantitative assessment of impairment for our Issuer Solutions, Europe Merchant Solutions, Spain Merchant Solutions and Latin America Merchant Solutions reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units. We determined on the basis of the quantitative assessments of our Issuer Solutions, Europe Merchant Solutions, Spain Merchant Solutions and Latin America Merchant Solutions reporting units that the fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its respective carrying amount, indicating no impairment. Additionally, we determined on the basis of the qualitative factors that the fair value of other reporting units was not more likely than not less than the respective carrying amounts. We believe that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount, except for our Issuer Solutions reporting unit, whose fair value exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 7% as of October 1, 2024.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, we realigned our reporting units based on strategic and organizational changes. The new reporting units are Core Payments Solutions, Integrated and Embedded Solutions, Point-of-Sale and Software Solutions, International Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. Upon realignment of our reporting units, we performed a quantitative assessment of impairment for our Core Payments Solutions, Integrated and Embedded Solutions and Point-of-Sale and Software Solutions reporting units, and determined on the basis of those assessments that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its respective carrying amount, indicating no impairment. Additionally, our International Merchant Solutions reporting unit was an aggregation of existing reporting units, and we concluded that the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying amount. The realignment did not affect our Issuer Solutions reporting unit. \nWe continue to closely monitor developments related to global events and macroeconomic conditions. The future magnitude, duration and effects of these events and conditions are difficult to predict at this time, and it is reasonably possible that future developments could have a negative effect on the estimates and assumptions utilized in our goodwill impairment assessments and could result in material impairment charges in future periods.\n54\nTable of Contents\nIntangible and Long-lived Assets\nWe regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment, lease right-of-use assets and finite-life intangible assets may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The evaluation is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If the carrying amount of the asset group is determined to be not recoverable and exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, measured as the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. Fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable. \nWe classify an asset or business as a held for sale disposal group if we have committed to a plan to sell the asset or business within one year and are actively marketing the asset or business in its current condition for a price that is reasonable in comparison to its estimated fair value. Disposal groups held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Subsequent changes to the estimated selling price of an asset or disposal group held for sale are recognized as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of income and any subsequent gains are limited to the cumulative losses previously recognized. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized net losses of $243.6 million and $71.9 million, respectively, on the consumer business disposition to reduce the carrying amount of the consumer disposal group to estimated fair value less costs to sell, including the effects of incremental negotiated closing adjustments, changes in the estimated fair value of the seller financing and the effects of the final tax structure of the transaction.\nCapitalization of Internal-Use Software Costs \nWe develop software that is used in providing services to customers. Capitalization of internal-use software costs, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. The preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are recognized as expense as incurred. Currently unforeseen circumstances in software development, such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used, obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to customer attrition, could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result, and from time to time has resulted, in an impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development costs. The carrying amount of internal-use software, including work-in-progress, at December 31, 2024 was $1,202.1 million. Costs capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $339.3 million.\nIn addition, we capitalize implementation costs associated with cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts following the same internal-use software capitalization criteria. Our cloud computing arrangements involve services we use to support certain internal corporate functions as well as technology associated with revenue-generating activities. We regularly evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of the capitalized implementation costs may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2024, capitalized implementation costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $215.4 million and are presented within other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Costs capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $45.1 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a charge of $55.8 million for technology assets that will no longer be utilized under a revised technology architecture development strategy. \nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n (\"ASC 606\"), we apply judgment in the determination of performance obligations, in particular related to large customer contracts within the Issuer Solutions segment. Performance obligations in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised services, we must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised services are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation. In addition, a single performance obligation may comprise a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.\n55\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our provision for income taxes using management's judgments, estimates and interpretation and application of complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Such differences in timing result in deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. \nWe believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we recognize the benefit for tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits. Issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related benefit recognized. When facts and circumstances change (including an effective settlement of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), the effect is recognized in the period of change. The unrecognized tax benefits that exist at December 31, 2024 would affect our provision for income taxes in the future, if recognized. \nJudgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. To the extent that we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, these deferred tax assets are adjusted via a valuation allowance through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made.\nSee \"Note 12\n—\nIncome Tax\" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and deferred tax valuation allowances during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries in Greece, Chile, and Germany relate to the portion of equity in each of those subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us, which is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. The redeemable noncontrolling interest for each subsidiary is reflected at the higher of: (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest's share of comprehensive income (loss), c\napital contributions and distributions or (ii) the redemption price\n. Estimates of redemption price are based on projected operating performance of each subsidiary, including key assumptions - revenue growth rates, current and expected market conditions and weighted-average cost of capital. Refer to “Note 16—Noncontrolling Interests” in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.\nEffect of New Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n \nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standards setting bodies that may affect our current and/or future financial statements. See \"Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.\nITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n \nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nCertain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies. Consequently, a portion of our revenues and expenses may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations to our consolidated revenues and operating income was insignificant.\nGenerally, the functional currency of our various subsidiaries is their local currency. We are exposed to currency fluctuations on transactions that are not denominated in the functional currency. Gains and losses on such transactions are included in determining net income for the period. We seek to mitigate our foreign currency risk through timely settlement of transactions and cash flow matching, when possible. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our transaction gains and losses were insignificant.\nAdditionally, we are affected by currency fluctuations in our funds settlement process on merchant payment, chargeback and card network settlement transactions that are not denominated in the currency of the underlying credit or debit card transaction. Gains and losses on these transactions are included in revenues for the period.\n56\nTable of Contents\nWe are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates on our investments in foreign operations. Relative to our net investment in foreign operations, the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated at the period-end rate of exchange. The resulting translation adjustment is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income and is included in shareholders' equity. We have designated our aggregate €800 million Euro-denominated senior notes due March 2031 as a hedge of our net investment in our Euro-denominated operations. The purpose of the net investment hedge is to offset the volatility of our net investment in our Euro-denominated operations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses associated with the Euro-denominated senior notes are presented within the same components of other comprehensive income and accumulated comprehensive income.\nTransaction gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature are also recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. When a foreign subsidiary is disposed of in its entirety, the associated accumulated foreign currency translation gains or losses are reclassified from the separate component of equity into our consolidated statement of income.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on certain of our long-term borrowings and cash investments. We invest our excess cash in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term. These investments earn a floating rate of interest and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes.\nWe have an unsubordinated unsecured $5.75 billion revolving credit facility, as well as a $2.0 billion commercial paper program and various lines of credit that we use to fund settlement in certain of our markets, each of which bears interest at rates that are based on market rates and fluctuate accordingly. As of December 31, 2024, the amount outstanding under these variable-rate debt arrangements and settlement lines of credit was $2.0 billion. As of December 31, 2024, we had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1.5 billion to hedge changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate risk on a portion of our variable-rate debt instruments as further discussed below.\nThe interest earned on our invested cash and the interest paid on a portion of our debt are based on variable interest rates; therefore, the exposure of our net income to a change in interest rates is partially mitigated as an increase in rates would increase both interest income and interest expense, and a reduction in rates would decrease both interest income and interest expense. Under our current policies, we may selectively use derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps or forward rate agreements, to manage all or a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes. We have entered into interest rate swaps that reduce a portion of our exposure to market interest rate risk on certain of our variable-rate debt as discussed in \"Note 10—Derivatives and Hedging Instruments\" in the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nBased on balances outstanding under variable-rate debt agreements and invested cash balances at December 31, 2024, a hypothetical increase of 50 basis points in applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2024 would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.2 million and increase our annual interest income by approximately $5.2 million.\n57\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Global Payments Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Payments Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition - Issuer Solutions\n - \nRefer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements\n.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company enters into long-term revenue contracts with its Issuer Solutions customers. Issuer Solutions customer contracts may include multiple promises, including processing services, loyalty redemption services and professional services to financial institutions and other financial services providers. The Company has determined that the processing services and loyalty redemption services represent stand-ready performance obligations comprising a series of distinct days of services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Professional services representing performance obligations are satisfied over time.\n58\nTable of Contents\nWe identified the determination of performance obligations for Issuer Solutions revenue contracts as a critical audit matter, given the judgment required to determine whether any unusual and/or complex terms within the contract are identified and evaluated appropriately. A high degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's identification of the performance obligations in the contract.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company's Issuer Solutions revenue transactions, specifically its identification of the performance obligations in contracts with its customers, included the following, among others:\n•\nWe evaluated the effectiveness of controls over Issuer Solutions contract revenues, including controls over the identification of performance obligations.\n•\nWe selected a sample of Issuer Solutions contracts and evaluated whether the performance obligations were appropriately identified in each of the selected contracts, including whether the promised services are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract.\nRevenues - Payment processing solutions and services\n - \nRefer to Note 1 to the financial statements\n.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company's revenues from its payment processing solutions and services consist of activity-based fees made up of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions, sourced from multiple systems and applications. The processing of transactions and recording of revenues is highly automated and is based on contractual terms with merchants, financial institutions, financial service providers, payment networks, and other parties.\nWe identified payment processing solutions and services revenues as a critical audit matter given the increased extent of effort, including the need for us to involve professionals with expertise in information technology (IT), to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems, software applications, and automated controls.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company's systems to process payment services revenues included the following, among others:\n•\nWith the assistance of our IT specialists, we:\n◦\nIdentified the significant systems used to process revenue transactions and tested the general IT controls over each of these systems, including testing of user access controls, change management controls, and IT operations controls.\n◦\nTested system interface controls and automated controls within the relevant revenue streams, as well as the controls designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of revenues. \n•\nWe tested controls within the relevant revenue business processes, including those in place to reconcile the various reports extracted from the IT systems to the Company’s general ledger.  \n•\nWe evaluated trends in recorded revenues, including interchange fees and payment network fees. \n•\nFor a sample of revenue transactions, we tested selected transactions by agreeing the amounts of revenue recognized to source documents and tested the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenues. \n•\nWe developed independent expectations of certain revenue streams and compared these to amounts recorded by the Company. \n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n \nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 14, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\n59\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Global Payments Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Global Payments Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by COSO. \nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 14, 2025 \n60\nTable of Contents\nGLOBAL PAYMENTS INC. \nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \nNOTE 1—\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \nBusiness, consolidation and presentation\n - \nWe are a leading payments technology company delivering innovative software and services to our customers globally. Our technologies, services and team member expertise allow us to provide a broad range of solutions that enable our customers to operate their businesses more efficiently across a variety of channels around the world. Global Payments Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively as \"Global Payments,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us,\" unless the context requires otherwise.\nWe operate in \ntwo\n reportable segments: Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. As described in \"Note 3—Business Dispositions,\" during the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our Netspend business, which comprised our former Consumer Solutions segment. Our consolidated financial statements include the results of our former Consumer Solutions segment for periods prior to disposition. See \"Note 18—Segment Information\" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our segments.\nThese consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, and all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities that we do not control are accounted for using the equity or cost method, based on whether or not we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\").\n \nUse of estimates\n - \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. In particular, uncertainty resulting from global events and other macroeconomic conditions are difficult to predict at this time, and the ultimate effect could result in additional charges related to the recoverability of assets, including financial assets, long-lived assets and goodwill and other losses. These consolidated financial statements reflect the financial statement effects based upon management’s estimates and assumptions utilizing the most currently available information.\n \nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-07 - \nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): \nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,\n\" which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses, inclusion of all annual disclosures in interim periods and disclosure of the title and position of the chief operating decision maker. We adopted ASU 2023-07 effective December 31, 2024 and applied it retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. See \"Note 18—Segment Information\" for further information.\nASU 2021-08 - \nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): \nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n.\" We elected to early adopt ASU 2021-08 during the year ended December 31, 2022, with application to any business combinations for which the acquisition date occurred after January 1, 2022.\n \nPrior to the adoption of this update, an acquirer generally recognized assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers and other similar contracts that are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n (\"Topic 606\" or \"ASC 606\"), at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 requires that an entity recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts, which should generally result in an acquirer recognizing and measuring the acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how they were recognized and measured in the acquiree’s financial statements. This update also provides certain practical expedients for acquirers when recognizing and measuring acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination. \n67\nTable of Contents\nRecently issued accounting pronouncement not yet adopted\nASU 2024-03\n - In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \"\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,\"\n which requires disclosure in the notes to financial statements of specified information about certain costs and expenses. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this update or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are evaluating the potential effects of ASU 2024-03 on our consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2023-09\n \n-\n In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): \nImprovement to Income Tax Disclosures,\"\n which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning with our fiscal year ended December 31, 2025. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. We are evaluating how the enhanced disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-09 will affect our presentation, and we will include the incremental disclosures upon the effective date.\nSEC rule changes\n - \nOn March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules that require disclosure of certain climate-related information, including disclosures relating to material climate-related risks, targets or goals, risk management and governance activities and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the rules require disclosure of certain climate-related financial metrics in the notes to the audited financial statements. The new disclosures are required on a prospective basis and provide for a phased-in compliance period. However, in April 2024, the SEC stayed the rules pending judicial review. Therefore, the timing of the effectiveness of these rules and their ultimate enforceability is uncertain.\n \nRevenue recognition\n - \nAt contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a good or service that is distinct. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods and services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services. \nMerchant Solutions.\n Our customers in the Merchant Solutions segment contract with us for payment services, which we provide in exchange for consideration for completed transactions. Our payment solutions are similar around the world in that we enable our customers to accept card, check and digital-based payments. Our comprehensive offerings include, but are not limited to, authorization, settlement and funding services, customer support, chargeback resolution, payment security services, consolidated billing and reporting. In addition, we may sell or lease point-of-sale terminals or other equipment to customers.\nFor our payment services, the nature of our promise to the customer is that we stand ready to process transactions the customer requests on a daily basis over the contract term. Since the timing and quantity of transactions to be processed by us is not determinable, we view payment services to comprise an obligation to stand ready to process as many transactions as the customer requests. Under a stand-ready obligation, the evaluation of the nature of our performance obligation is focused on each time increment rather than the underlying activities. Therefore, we view payment services to comprise a series of distinct days of service that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Accordingly, the promise to stand ready is accounted for as a single series performance obligation.\n68\nTable of Contents\nIn order to provide our payment services, we route and clear each transaction through the applicable payment network. We obtain authorization for the transaction and request funds settlement from the card issuing financial institution through the payment network. When third parties are involved in the transfer of goods or services to our customer, we consider the nature of each specific promised good or service and apply judgment to determine whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer or whether we are acting as an agent of the third party. To determine whether or not we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer, we assess indicators including which party is primarily responsible for fulfillment and which party has discretion in determining pricing for the good or service, as well as other considerations. Based on our assessment of these indicators, we have concluded that our promise to our customer to provide our payment services is distinct from the services provided by the card issuing financial institutions and payment networks in connection with payment transactions. We do not have the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits of the services provided by the card issuing financial institutions and payment networks before those services are transferred to our customer, and on that basis, we do not control those services prior to being transferred to our customer. As a result, we present our revenues net of the interchange fees retained by the card issuing financial institutions and the fees charged by the payment networks.\nThe majority of our payment services are priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on the card type. We also charge other per occurrence fees for specific services that may be unrelated to the number of transactions or transaction value. \nGiven the nature of the promise and the underlying fees based on unknown quantities or outcomes of services to be performed over the contract term, the total consideration is determined to be variable consideration. The variable consideration for our payment service is usage-based and, therefore, it specifically relates to our efforts to satisfy our payment services performance obligation. The variability is satisfied each day the service is provided to the customer. We directly ascribe variable fees to the distinct day of service to which it relates, and we consider the services performed each day in order to ascribe the appropriate amount of total fees to that day. Therefore, we measure revenues for our payment service on a daily basis based on the services that are performed on that day. \nCertain of our technology-enabled customer arrangements contain multiple promises, such as payment services, perpetual software licenses, software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\"), maintenance, installation services, training and equipment, each of which is evaluated to determine whether it represents a separate performance obligation. SaaS arrangements are generally offered on a subscription basis, providing the customers with access to the SaaS platform along with general support and maintenance services. Because these promised services within our SaaS arrangements are delivered concurrently over the contract term, we account for these promises as if they are a single performance obligation that includes a series of distinct services with the same pattern of transfer to the customer. In addition, certain implementation services are not considered distinct from the SaaS and are recognized over the expected period of benefit.\nOnce we determine the performance obligations and the transaction price, including an estimate of any variable consideration, we then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract using a relative standalone selling price method. We determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the good or service is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price by considering all reasonably available information, including market conditions, trends or other company- or customer-specific factors. \nSubstantially all of the performance obligations within our SaaS arrangements described above are satisfied over time. We satisfy the combined SaaS performance obligation by standing ready to provide access to the SaaS. Consideration for SaaS arrangements may consist of fixed or usage-based fees. Revenue is recognized over the period for which the services are provided or by directly ascribing any variable fees to the distinct day of service based on the services that are performed on that day. The performance obligations associated with equipment sales, perpetual software licenses and certain professional services are generally satisfied at a point in time when they are transferred to the customer. For certain other professional services that represent separate performance obligations, we generally use the input method and recognize revenue based on the number of hours incurred or services performed to date in relation to the total services expected to be required to satisfy the performance obligation. \n69\nTable of Contents\nIssuer Solutions.\n Issuer Solutions segment revenues are primarily derived from long-term contracts with financial institutions and other financial service providers. Issuer Solutions customer contracts typically include an obligation to provide processing services to those customers. Payment processing services revenues are generated primarily from charges based on the number of accounts on file, transactions and authorizations processed, statements generated and/or mailed, managed services, cards embossed and mailed, and other processing services for cardholder accounts on file. Most of the customer contracts have prescribed annual minimums, penalties for early termination, and service level agreements that may affect contractual fees if specific service levels are not achieved. We have determined that these processing services represent a stand-ready obligation comprising a series of distinct days of services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. \nIssuer Solutions contracts may also include additional performance obligations relating to loyalty redemption services and other professional services. Similar to processing services, we have determined that loyalty redemption services represent a stand-ready obligation comprising a series of distinct days of service that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.\nTo the extent a contract includes multiple promised services, we must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria for being distinct are not met, the promised services are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation.\nThe performance obligations to provide processing services and loyalty redemption services include variable consideration. The variable consideration for our services is usage-based and, therefore, it specifically relates to our efforts to satisfy our services performance obligation. The variability is satisfied each day the service is provided to the customer. We directly ascribe variable fees to the distinct day of service to which it relates, and we consider the services performed each day in order to ascribe the appropriate amount of total fees to that day. Therefore, we measure revenues for our services on a daily basis based on the services that are performed on that day. \nProfessional services performance obligations are satisfied over time. For professional services, we recognize revenue based on the labor hours incurred for time and materials projects or on a straight-line basis for fixed-fee projects.\nIn some cases, we pay certain of our customers a signing incentive at contract inception or renewal. Consideration paid to customers is accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price and recognized as a reduction in revenues as the related services are provided to the customer, typically over the contract term. The deferred portion of consideration paid to customers is classified within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nOther Issuer Solutions customer arrangements provide business-to-business (\"B2B\") payment services, consisting of a stand-ready obligation to process financial transactions for which revenue is recognized on a daily basis based on the services that are performed on that day. Customer contracts may also include subscription based SaaS arrangements that automate key procurement processes and enable virtual cards and integrated payments options, for which revenue is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that the services are first made available to the customer.\nConsumer Solutions. \nDuring the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our Netspend business, which comprised our former Consumer Solutions segment. For the periods prior to disposition, our Consumer Solutions arrangements included a stand-ready performance obligation to provide account access and facilitate purchase transactions. Revenues principally consisted of fees collected from cardholders and fees generated by cardholder activity in connection with the programs that we managed. Customers were typically charged a fee for each purchase transaction made using their cards, unless the customer was on a monthly or annual service plan, in which case the customer was instead charged a monthly or annual subscription fee, as applicable. Customers were also charged a monthly maintenance fee after a specified period of inactivity. We also charged fees associated with additional services offered in connection with our accounts, including the use of overdraft features, a variety of bill payment options, card replacement, foreign exchange and card-to-card transfers of funds initiated through our call centers.\n70\nTable of Contents\nWe determined that we had a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponded directly with our performance completed to date. As a result, we recognized revenue in the amount to which we had a right to invoice. Revenues were recognized net of fees charged by the payment networks for services they provided in processing transactions routed through them.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n -\n Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We consider certain portions of our cash and cash equivalents to be unrestricted but not available for general purposes. The amount of cash that we consider to be available for general purposes, $\n1,067.5\n million and $\n703.3\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, does not include the following: (i) settlement-related cash balances, (ii) funds held as collateral for merchant losses (\"Merchant Reserves\") and (iii) funds held for customers. Settlement-related cash balances represent funds that we hold when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the funding obligation to the merchant. Settlement-related cash balances are not restricted in their use; however, these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of a processing obligation the following day. Merchant Reserves serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement. We recognize a corresponding liability in settlement processing assets and settlement processing obligations in our consolidated balance sheets. While this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash as Merchant Reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with financial institutions that sponsor us. Funds held for customers, which are not restricted in their use, include amounts collected before the corresponding obligation is due to be settled to or at the direction of our customers. \nRestricted cash includes amounts that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities under legal or regulatory restrictions. Restricted cash consists of amounts deposited by customers for prepaid card transactions and funds held as a liquidity reserve that are subject to local regulatory restrictions requiring appropriate segregation and restriction in their use. Restricted cash is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nWe regularly maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit or the equivalent outside the U.S. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, approximately \n75\n% of our total balance of cash and cash equivalents was held within a small group of financial institutions, primarily large money center banks. Although we currently believe that the financial institutions with whom we do business will be able to fulfill their commitments to us, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue to do so. We have not experienced any losses associated with our balances in such accounts for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022\n.\nA reconciliation of the amounts of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets to the amount in the consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,538,416\n \n$\n2,088,887\n \nRestricted cash\n197,559\n \n167,190\n \nCash included in assets held for sale\n—\n \n798\n \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows\n$\n2,735,975\n \n$\n2,256,875\n \nAccounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities\n - \nA contract with a customer creates legal rights and obligations. As we perform under customer contracts, our right to consideration that is unconditional is considered to be accounts receivable. If our right to consideration for such performance is contingent upon a future event or satisfaction of additional performance obligations, the amount of revenues we have recognized in excess of the amount we have billed to the customer is recognized as a contract asset. Contract liabilities represent consideration received from customers in excess of revenues recognized. Contract assets and liabilities are presented net at the individual contract level in the consolidated balance sheet and are classified as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the underlying contractual rights and obligations.\n See \"Note 4\n—\nRevenues\" for further information.\n71\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for credit losses on accounts receivable\n -\n We are exposed to credit losses on accounts receivable balances. We utilize a combination of aging and loss-rate methods to develop an estimate of current expected credit losses, depending on the nature and risk profile of the underlying asset pool. A broad range of information is considered in the estimation process, including historical loss information adjusted for current conditions and expectations of future trends. The estimation process also includes consideration of qualitative and quantitative risk factors associated with the age of asset balances, expected timing of payment, contract terms and conditions, changes in specific customer risk profiles or mix of customers, geographic risk, industry or economic trends and relevant environmental factors. Accounts receivable is presented net of an allowance for credit losses of $\n24.7\n million and $\n19.0\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe measurement of the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable is recognized through credit loss expense and is included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. We recognized credit loss expense of $\n25.0\n million, $\n23.3\n million and $\n15.0\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Write-offs are recognized in the period in which the asset is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries are recognized when received as a direct credit to the credit loss expense.\nRevenues are recognized net of estimated billing adjustments. Adjustments to customer invoices are charged against the allowance for billing adjustments.\nContract costs\n - \nWe capitalize certain costs to obtain contracts with customers, including employee sales commissions and fees to business partners. At contract inception, we capitalize costs incurred that we expect to recover and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. In certain instances in which costs related to obtaining customers are incurred after the inception of the customer contract, such costs are capitalized as the corresponding liability is recognized. We also capitalize certain costs incurred to fulfill our contracts with customers that (i) relate directly to the contract, (ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy our performance obligation under the contract and (iii) are expected to be recovered through revenues generated under the contract. Capitalized costs to obtain and to fulfill contracts are included in other noncurrent assets. \nContract costs are amortized to operating expense in our consolidated statements of income on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Amortization of capitalized costs to obtain customer contracts is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, while amortization of capitalized costs to fulfill customer contracts is included in cost of services. We utilize a straight-line or proportional amortization method depending upon which method best depicts the pattern of transfer of the goods or services to the customer. We amortize these assets over the expected period of benefit, which, based on the factors noted above, is typically \nthree\n to \nseven years\n. In order to determine the appropriate amortization period for capitalized contract costs, we consider a combination of factors, including customer attrition rates, estimated terms of customer relationships, the useful lives of technology we use to provide goods and services to our customers, whether future contract renewals are expected and if there is any incremental commission expected to be paid associated with a contract renewal. Costs to obtain a contract with an expected period of benefit of one year or less are recognized as an expense when incurred. We evaluate contract costs for impairment by comparing, on a pooled basis, the expected future net cash flows from underlying customer relationships to the carrying amount of the capitalized contract costs.\n See \"Note 4\n—\nRevenues\" for further information.\nUp-front distributor and partner payments\n -\n We capitalize certain up-front contractual payments to third-party distributors and partners and recognize the capitalized amount as expense ratably over the period of benefit, which is generally the contract period. If the contract requires the distributor or partner to perform specific acts and no other conditions exist for the distributor or partner to earn or retain the up-front payment, then we recognize the capitalized amount as an expense when the performance conditions have been met. Up-front distributor and partner payments are classified in our consolidated balance sheets within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets and the related expense is reported within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income.\nSettlement processing assets and obligations\n -\n Funds settlement refers to the process in our Merchant Solutions segment of transferring funds between card issuers and merchants for merchant sales and credits processed on our systems. We use our internal network to provide funding instructions to financial institutions that in turn fund the merchants. We process funds settlement under two models, a sponsorship model and a direct membership model.\n72\nTable of Contents\nUnder the sponsorship model, we are designated as an independent sales organization by Mastercard and Visa, which means that member clearing banks (\"Member\") sponsor us and require our adherence to the standards of the payment networks. In certain markets, we have sponsorship or depository and clearing agreements with financial institution sponsors. These agreements allow us to route transactions under the Members' control and identification numbers to clear credit card transactions through Mastercard and Visa. In this model, the standards of the payment networks restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds, and, instead, require that these funds be in the possession of the Member until the merchant is funded.\nUnder the direct membership model, we are members in various payment networks, allowing us to process and fund transactions without third-party sponsorship. In this model, we route and clear transactions directly through the card brand’s network and are not restricted from performing funds settlement. Otherwise, we process these transactions similarly to how we process transactions in the sponsorship model. We are required to adhere to the standards of the payment networks in which we are direct members. We maintain relationships with financial institutions, which may also serve as our Member sponsors for other card brands or in other markets, to assist with funds settlement.\nTiming differences, interchange fees, merchant reserves and exception items cause differences between the amount received from the payment networks and the amount funded to the merchants. These intermediary balances arising in our settlement process are reflected as settlement processing assets and obligations in our consolidated balance sheets. \nSettlement processing assets and obligations include the following components:\n•\nInterchange reimbursement\n. Our receivable from merchants for the portion of the discount fee related to reimbursement of the interchange fee.\n•\nReceivable from Members.\n Our receivable from the Members for transactions in which we have advanced funding to the Members to fund merchants in advance of receipt of funding from payment networks.\n•\nReceivable from networks\n. Our receivable from a payment network for transactions processed on behalf of merchants where we are a direct member of that particular network.\n•\nException items\n. Items such as customer chargeback amounts received from merchants.\n•\nMerchant Reserves\n. Reserves held to minimize contingent liabilities associated with losses that may occur under the merchant agreement.\n•\nLiability to Members\n. Our liability to the Members for transactions that have not yet been funded to the merchants.\n•\nLiability to merchants\n. Our liability to merchants for transactions that have been processed but not yet funded where we are a direct member of a particular payment network.\n•\nAllowance for credit and other merchant losses on settlement assets.\n Allowances, charges or expected credit losses on chargebacks, merchant fraud or other merchant-related reason.\nWe apply offsetting to our settlement processing assets and obligations where a right of setoff exists. In the sponsorship model, we apply offsetting by Member agreement because the Member is ultimately responsible for funds settlement. With these Member transactions, we do not have access to the gross proceeds of the receivable from the payment networks and, thus, do not have a direct obligation or any ability to satisfy the payable to fund the merchant. In these situations, we apply offsetting to determine a net position for each Member agreement. If that net position is an asset, we reflect the net amount in settlement processing assets in our consolidated balance sheet. If that net position is a liability, we reflect the net amount in settlement processing obligations in our consolidated balance sheet. In the direct membership model, offsetting is not applied, and the individual components are presented as an asset or obligation based on the nature of that component.\n73\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for credit and other merchant losses on settlement assets\n -\n Our merchant customers are liable for any charges or losses that occur under the merchant agreement. We have a risk of loss in our card processing services associated with the liability to collect amounts from merchant customers for any charges properly reversed by the card issuing financial institutions. We are therefore exposed to credit losses on these settlement processing assets. We utilize a combination of aging and loss-rate methods to develop an estimate of current expected credit losses, depending on the nature and risk profile of the underlying asset pool. A broad range of information is considered in the estimation process, including historical loss information adjusted for current conditions and expectations of future trends. The estimation process also includes consideration of qualitative and quantitative risk factors associated with the age of asset balances, expected timing of payment, contract terms and conditions, changes in specific customer risk profiles or mix of customers, geographic risk, industry or economic trends and relevant environmental factors. We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral from certain merchants to minimize the risk of loss, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. The allowance for credit losses on settlement processing assets was $\n10.0\n million and $\n9.7\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe measurement of the allowance for credit losses on settlement assets is recognized through credit loss expenses and is included as a component of cost of service in our consolidated statements of income. We recognized credit loss expense of $\n22.4\n million, $\n19.2\n million and $\n13.0\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Write-offs are recognized in the period in which the asset is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries are recognized when received as a direct credit to the credit loss expense.\nAdditionally, when we are not able to collect these amounts from merchants due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for the reversed charges. We recognize an estimated liability for merchant losses comprised of estimated incurred but not reported losses, which is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The provision for merchant losses is included as a component of cost of service in our consolidated statements of income.\nReserve for contract contingencies and processing errors\n - \nA significant number of our customer contracts in our Issuer Solutions segment contain service level agreements that can result in performance penalties payable by us if we do not meet contractually required service levels. We recognize an accrual for estimated performance penalties and processing errors. When providing for these accruals, we consider such factors as our history of incurring performance penalties and processing errors, actual contractual penalty charge rates in our contracts, progress towards milestones and known processing errors. These accruals are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Depending on the nature of the item, transaction processing provisions are either included as a reduction of the transaction price and recognized as a reduction in revenues as the related services are provided to the customer, or recognized as a component of cost of service, in our consolidated statements of income. \nReserve for cardholder losses\n -\n Through services offered in our former Consumer Solutions segment, we were exposed to losses due to cardholder fraud, payment defaults and other forms of cardholder activity as well as losses due to nonperformance of third parties who received cardholder funds for transmittal to the issuing financial institutions. We established a reserve for losses we estimated would arise from processing customer transactions, debit card overdrafts, chargebacks for unauthorized card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to nondelivery of goods and services. These reserves were established based upon historical loss and recovery rates and cardholder activity for which specific losses could be identified. Prior to the disposition of our consumer business, the provision for cardholder losses was included as a component of cost of service in our consolidated statements of income.\nProperty and equipment\n - Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are generally calculated using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining term of the lease and the useful life of the asset.\n74\nTable of Contents\nWe develop software that is used to provide services to customers. Capitalization of internal-use software costs, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are recognized as expense as incurred. Capitalized internal-use software is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is typically \nfive\n to \nten years\n, in a manner that best reflects the pattern of economic use of the assets.\n See \"Note 5\n—\nProperty and Equipment\" for further information.\nGoodwill\n -\n We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually (in the fourth quarter) and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative assessment for impairment is necessary. The election of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit.\nFactors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of our reporting units, events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units, our share price, and other relevant entity-specific events. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test would be required. The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \nDuring the second quarter of 2022, a sustained decline in our share price and increases in discount rates, primarily resulting from increased economic uncertainty, indicated a potential decline in fair value and triggered a requirement to evaluate our Issuer Solutions and former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting units for potential impairment as of June 30, 2022. Furthermore, the estimated sales price for the consumer business portion of our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit also indicated a potential decline in fair value as of June 30, 2022. We determined on the basis of the quantitative assessment that the fair value of our Issuer Solutions reporting unit was still greater than its carrying amount as of June 30, 2022, indicating no impairment. Based on the quantitative assessment of our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit, including consideration of the consumer business disposal group and the remaining assets of the reporting unit, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $\n833.1\n million in our consolidated statement of income during the three months ended June 30, 2022. The estimated fair value used in the goodwill impairment assessment was considered to be a nonrecurring Level 3 measurement of the valuation hierarchy. \nDuring the third quarter of 2022, as a result of the pending disposition of our consumer business and changes in how our business is managed, we realigned the businesses previously comprising our former Business and Consumer Solutions segment to include the B2B portion within our Issuer Solutions segment and the consumer portion forming our Consumer Solutions segment. In connection with the change in presentation of segment information, the B2B portion of our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit was realigned into the Issuer Solutions reporting unit, including a reallocation of goodwill. During the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of our consumer business. In addition, during 2023, we realigned our reporting units based on organizational changes and the acquired operations of EVO. \nAs of October 1, 2024, our reporting units consisted of the following: North America Payments Solutions, Vertical Market Software Solutions, Europe Merchant Solutions, Spain Merchant Solutions, Asia-Pacific Merchant Solutions, Latin America Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. As of October 1, 2024, we performed a quantitative assessment of impairment for our Issuer Solutions, Europe Merchant Solutions, Spain Merchant Solutions and Latin America Merchant Solutions reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units. We determined on the basis of the quantitative assessments of our Issuer Solutions, Europe Merchant Solutions, Spain Merchant Solutions and Latin America Merchant Solutions reporting units that the fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its respective carrying amount, indicating no impairment. Additionally, we determined on the basis of the qualitative factors that the fair value of other reporting units was not more likely than not less than the respective carrying amounts.\n75\nTable of Contents\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, we realigned our reporting units based on a strategic and organizational changes. The new reporting units are Core Payments Solutions, Integrated and Embedded Solutions, Point-of-Sale and Software Solutions, International Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. Upon realignment of our reporting units, we performed a quantitative assessment of impairment for our Core Payments Solutions, Integrated and Embedded Solutions and Point-of-Sale and Software Solutions reporting units, and determined on the basis of those assessments that the fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its respective carrying amount, indicating no impairment. Additionally, our International Merchant Solutions reporting unit was an aggregation of our former Europe, Spain and Asia-Pacific reporting units, and was not more likely than not less than its respective carrying amounts. The realignment did not affect our Issuer Solutions reporting unit. \nSee \"Note 6\n—\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" for further information.\nOther intangible assets\n -\n Other intangible assets include customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists, merchant contracts and referral agreements), contract-based intangible assets (such as noncompete agreements, distributor agreements and processing rights), acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names associated with business combinations. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements. The useful lives of acquired technologies are based on an estimate of the period over which we expect to receive economic benefit. The useful lives of amortizable trademarks and trade names are based on an estimate of the period over which we will earn revenues for the related assets, including contemplation of any future plans to use the trademarks and trade names in the applicable markets. \nWe use the straight-line method of amortization for our amortizable acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names and certain contract-based intangible assets. Amortization for most of our customer-related intangible assets and certain contract-based intangible assets is determined using an accelerated method. Under this accelerated method, we determine amortization expense for any period by first dividing the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquisition-date fair value of the asset by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We then multiply that ratio by the initial carrying amount of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. If the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates, we adjust the amortization schedule prospectively. We believe that our accelerated method reflects the expected pattern of the benefit to be derived. See \"Note 6\n—\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" for further information.\nImplementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement\n - \nWe capitalize implementation costs associated with cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts, and we amortize these capitalized implementation costs to expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable hosting arrangement. Our cloud computing arrangements involve services we use to support certain internal corporate functions as well as technology associated with revenue-generating activities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, capitalized implementation costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $\n215.4\n million and $\n206.5\n million, respectively, and are presented within other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n7.6\n million, $\n3.8\n million and $\n3.1\n million, respectively, and is presented in the same line item in the consolidated statements of income as the expense for the associated cloud services arrangement. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we also recognized a charge of $\n28.5\n million for technology assets that will no longer be utilized under a revised technology architecture development strategy, which was included within \nselling, general and administrative expenses\n in our consolidated statements of income and included within Corporate expenses for segment reporting purposes.\n76\nTable of Contents\nLeases\n - \nWe evaluate each of our lease and service arrangements at inception to determine if the arrangement is, or contains, a lease and the appropriate classification of each identified lease. A lease exists if we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of, and have the right to control the use of, an asset for a period of time. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease agreement. We recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date based on the present values of fixed lease payments over the term of the lease. Right-of-use assets may also be adjusted to reflect any prepayments made or any incentive payments received. Operating lease costs and depreciation expense for finance leases are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We consider a termination or renewal option in the determination of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Because our leases generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit interest rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate to measure the lease liability and associated right-of-use asset at the lease commencement date. The incremental borrowing rate used is a fully collateralized rate that considers our credit rating, market conditions and the term of the lease at the lease commencement date. We have made an accounting policy election to not recognize assets or liabilities for leases with a term of less than 12 months and to account for all components in a lease arrangement as a single combined lease component for all asset classes with the exception of computer equipment, for which we account for lease and nonlease components separately.\n See \"Note 7\n—\nLeases\" for further information.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n - \nWe regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment, capitalized software, lease right-of-use assets and finite-life intangible assets may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The evaluation is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If the carrying amount of the asset group is determined to be not recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recognized. Fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable. We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may warrant revision.\nAssets held for sale\n -\n We classify an asset or business as a held for sale disposal group if we have committed to a plan to sell the asset or business within one year and are actively marketing the asset or business in its current condition for a price that is reasonable in comparison to its estimated fair value. Disposal groups held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Long-lived assets classified as held for sale are not subject to depreciation or amortization, and both the assets and any liabilities directly associated with the disposal group are presented net within separate current and noncurrent held for sale line items in our consolidated balance sheets. Subsequent changes to the estimated selling price of an asset or disposal group held for sale are recognized as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of income and any subsequent gains are limited to the cumulative losses previously recognized.\nNotes receivable and allowance for credit losses\n -\n During the year ended December 31, 2023, we provided seller financing in connection with the sale of our former consumer and gaming businesses. We classify notes receivable as held for investment based on the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, and the notes are presented at amortized cost within notes receivable in our consolidated balance sheet. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which includes the accretion of the difference between the fair value at inception and the face value of the notes.\nWe are exposed to credit losses on the notes. We utilize a probability-of-default and loss given default method to develop an estimate of current expected credit losses applied at the loan level. A variety of factors are considered to estimate the expected credit loss, including the probability of default (representing the probability the asset will default within a given time frame), the loss given default (representing the percentage of the asset that is not expected to be collected due to default), leverage ratios, interest rates, market and industry data, and forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The estimation process also includes consideration of qualitative and quantitative risk factors associated with expected timing of payment, industry trends and current and anticipated future economic conditions. Expected credit losses are estimated over the life of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. We recognized a noncash charge as an allowance for estimated future credit losses on the notes of $\n15.2\n million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is included as a component of interest and other expense in our consolidated statements of income. Notes receivable are presented net of an allowance for credit losses of $\n15.2\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \n77\nTable of Contents\nEquity method investments\n - We have certain investments, including a \n45\n% interest in China UnionPay Data Co., Ltd. that we account for using the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are recognized initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our portion of equity in earnings, cash contributions and distributions, and foreign currency translation adjustments. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had total equity method investments of $\n999.3\n million and $\n989.6\n million, respectively, presented within other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\n \nAccrued buyout liability\n -\n Certain of our Merchant Solutions salespersons in the United States are paid residual commissions based on the profitability generated by certain merchant customers. We have the right, but not the obligation, to buy out some or all of these commissions and intend to do so periodically. Such purchases of the commissions are at a fixed multiple of the last 12 months of commissions. Because of our intent and ability to execute purchases of the residual commissions, and the mutual understanding between us and our salespersons, we have accounted for this deferred compensation arrangement pursuant to the substantive nature of the plan. Therefore, we recognize a liability for the amount that we would have to pay (the \"settlement cost\") to buy out related commissions in their entirety from vested salespersons, and an estimated amount for unvested salespersons based on their progress towards vesting and the expected percentage that will become vested. As the liability increases over the first year of the related merchant contract, we recognize a related asset. Subsequent changes in the estimated accrued buyout liability due to merchant attrition, same-store sales growth or contraction and changes in profitability are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income. The classification of the accrued buyout liability between current and noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet is based upon our estimate of the amount of the accrued buyout liability that we reasonably expect to pay over the next 12 months.\nIncome taxes\n - \nDeferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax laws and rates. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe periodically assess our tax exposures related to periods that are open to examination. Based on the latest available information, we evaluate our tax positions to determine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. If we do not reach a more-likely-than-not determination, no benefit is recognized. If we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled. We present interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in interest and other expense and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in our consolidated statements of income.\n See \"Note 12\n—\nIncome Tax\" for further information.\nDerivative instruments\n - \nWe may use interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to manage a portion of our exposure to the variability in interest rates. Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuation in interest rates is to better control this element of cost and to mitigate the earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in applicable rates. We have established policies and procedures that encompass risk-management philosophy and objectives, guidelines for derivative instrument usage, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of derivative activity. We do not use derivative instruments for speculation. \nAt inception, we formally designate and document instruments that qualify for hedge accounting of underlying exposures. When qualified for hedge accounting, these financial instruments are recognized at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within equity in our consolidated balance sheets. Cash flows resulting from settlements are presented as a component of cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows. \nWe formally assess, both at inception and at least quarterly, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of the related underlying exposure. Fluctuations in the value of these instruments generally are offset by changes in the forecasted cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. This offset is driven by the high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument. We designated each of our active interest rate swap agreements as a cash flow hedge of interest payments on variable rate borrowings.\n78\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we designated our Euro-denominated senior notes as a hedge of our net investment in our Euro-denominated operations. The purpose of the net investment hedge is to offset the volatility of our net investment in our Euro-denominated operations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses associated with the Euro-denominated senior notes and our Euro-denominated operations are presented within the same components of other comprehensive income and accumulated comprehensive income.\nSee \"Note 10\n—\nDerivatives and Hedging Instruments\" for further information about our derivative instruments.\nFair value measurements\n -\n Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are based on other observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as interest rates and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our assumptions and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability.\nFair value of financial instruments\n - \nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, settlement lines of credit, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value given the short-term nature of these items. \nThe estimated fair value of our senior notes was based on quoted market prices in an active market and is considered to be a Level 1 measurement of the valuation hierarchy. The estimated fair value of our $\n2.0\n billion \n1.500\n% convertible notes was based on quoted market prices in an active market and is considered to be a Level 1 measurement of the valuation hierarchy and our $\n1.5\n billion \n1.000\n% convertible notes was based on a lattice pricing model and is considered to be a Level 3 measurement of the valuation hierarchy. Certain of our long-term debt arrangements include variable interest rates. The fair value of long-term debt with variable interest rates was determined using Level 2 inputs, and approximated carrying amount, exclusive of debt issuance costs. The fair values of our swap agreements were determined based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows using implied rates in the applicable yield curve as of the valuation date and classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. See \"Note 9\n—\nLong-Term Debt and Lines of Credit\" and \"Note 10\n—\nDerivatives and Hedging Instruments\" for further information. \nThe estimated fair value of our notes receivable was based on a discounted cash flow approach and is considered to be a Level 3 measurement of the valuation hierarchy. See \"Note 3\n—\nBusiness Dispositions\" for further information.\nWe also have investments in equity instruments without readily determinable fair values. As permitted, we have elected a measurement alternative for equity instruments that do not have readily determinable fair values. Under such alternative, these instruments are measured at cost plus or minus any changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer less any impairments. Any resulting change in carrying amount would be reflected in net income.\n \nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n - \nRedeemable noncontrolling interests refers to noncontrolling interests that are redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control and is reported in the mezzanine section between total liabilities and shareholders' equity, as temporary equity in our consolidated balance sheets. The redeemable noncontrolling interests for each subsidiary are adjusted each reporting period to the higher of: (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest's share of comprehensive income (loss), capital contributions and distributions or (ii) the redemption price. In determining the measurement method of redemption price, we have elected to accrete changes in the redemption price over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the instrument using the effective interest method, applied prospectively. We have also elected to recognize the entire amount of any redemption price adjustments in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income. Certain of our redeemable noncontrolling interests are redeemable at fair value and are considered to be a Level 3 measurement of the valuation hierarchy.\n See \"Note 16\n—\nNoncontrolling Interests\" for further information. \n79\nTable of Contents\nForeign currencies\n - \nWe have significant operations in a number of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency. The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated into the reporting currency at the period-end rate of exchange. Income statement items are translated at the weighted-average rates prevailing during the period. The resulting translation adjustment is presented as a component of other comprehensive income and is included in accumulated comprehensive income within equity in our consolidated balance sheets.\nGains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are generally included in determining net income for the period. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our transaction gains and losses were insignificant. Transaction gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature are presented as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and included in accumulated comprehensive income (loss) within equity in our consolidated balance sheets. When a foreign subsidiary is disposed of in its entirety, the associated accumulated foreign currency translation gains or losses are reclassified from the separate component of equity into our consolidated statement of income.\nEarnings per share\n - \nBasic earnings per share (\"EPS\") is computed by dividing net income attributable to Global Payments by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Earnings available to common shareholders is the same as net income attributable to Global Payments for all periods presented.\n \nDiluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Global Payments by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period, including the effect of share-based awards, convertible notes or other potential securities that would have a dilutive effect on EPS. All stock options with an exercise price lower than the average market share price of our common stock for the period are assumed to have a dilutive effect on EPS. The dilutive share base for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 excluded approximately \n293,422\n, \n191,353\n and \n700,119\n, respectively, shares related to stock options that would have an antidilutive effect on the computation of diluted earnings per share.\nThe effect of the potential shares needed to settle the conversion spread on our convertible notes is included in diluted EPS if the effect is dilutive. The effect depends on the market share price of our common stock at the time of conversion and would be dilutive if the average market share price of our common stock for the period exceeds the conversion price. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the convertible notes were not included in the computation of diluted EPS as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. Furthermore, the effect of the related capped call transactions is not included in the computation of diluted EPS as it is always anti-dilutive.\n \nThe following table sets forth the computation of the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding for all periods presented:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nBasic weighted-average number of shares outstanding\n254,291\n \n261,126\n \n275,191\n \nPlus: Dilutive effect of stock options and other share-based awards\n554\n \n572\n \n385\n \nDiluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding\n254,845\n \n261,698\n \n275,576\n \nRepurchased shares\n - \nWe account for the retirement of repurchased shares using the par value method under which the repurchase price is charged to paid-in capital up to the amount of the original issue proceeds of those shares. When the repurchase price is greater than the original issue proceeds, the excess is charged to retained earnings. We use a last-in, first-out cost flow assumption to identify the original issue proceeds of the shares repurchased. See \"Note 13\n—\nShareholders' Equity\" for further information.\n80\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 2— \nACQUISITIONS\nEVO Payments, Inc.\nIn March 2023, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of EVO Payments, Inc. (“EVO”). EVO is a payment technology and services provider, offering payment solutions to merchants ranging from small and middle market enterprises to multinational companies and organizations across the Americas and Europe. The acquisition aligns with our technology-enabled payments strategy, expands our geographic presence in attractive markets and augments our business-to-business software and payment solutions business. \nTotal purchase consideration was $\n4.3\n billion, which consisted of the following (in thousands):\nCash paid to EVO shareholders\n (1)\n$\n3,273,951\n \nCash paid for equity awards attributable to purchase consideration \n(2)\n58,510\n \nValue of replacement awards attributable to purchase consideration \n(3)\n2,484\n \nTotal purchase consideration transferred to EVO shareholders\n3,334,945\n \nRepayment of EVO's unsecured revolving credit facility (including accrued interest and fees)\n665,557\n \nPayment of certain acquiree transaction costs and other liabilities on behalf of EVO\n (4)\n269,118\n \nTotal purchase consideration\n$\n4,269,620\n \n(1) \nHolders of EVO common stock, convertible preferred stock and common units received $\n34\n for each share of EVO common stock held at the effective time of the transaction.\n(2)\n Pursuant to the merger agreement, we cash settled vested options and certain unvested equity awards of EVO equity award holders.\n(3)\n Pursuant to the merger agreement, we granted equity awards for approximately \n0.3\n million shares of Global Payments common stock to certain EVO equity award holders. Each such replacement award is subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and exercisability) that applied to the corresponding EVO equity award. We apportioned the fair value of the replacement awards between purchase consideration (the portion attributable to pre-acquisition services in relation to the total vesting term of the award) and amounts to be recognized in periods following the acquisition as share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the replacement awards.\n(4) \nCertain acquiree transaction costs and liabilities, including amounts outstanding under EVO’s tax receivable agreement, were required to be repaid by us upon consummation of the acquisition.\n \n81\nTable of Contents\nThe cash portion of the purchase consideration was funded through cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nWe accounted for the EVO acquisition as a business combination, which generally requires that we recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the acquisition date. \nThe final estimated acquisition-date fair values of major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including a reconciliation to the total purchase consideration, were as follows (in thousands):\nFinal Amounts\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n324,859\n \nAccounts receivable\n51,470\n \nSettlement processing assets\n134,712\n \nDeferred income tax assets\n1,734\n \nProperty and equipment\n72,100\n \nIdentifiable intangible assets\n1,478,995\n \nOther assets\n148,567\n \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n(\n289,360\n)\nSettlement lines of credit\n(\n7,587\n)\nSettlement processing obligations\n(\n163,535\n)\nDeferred income tax liabilities\n(\n253,221\n)\nOther liabilities\n(\n61,207\n)\nTotal identifiable net assets\n1,437,527\n \nRedeemable noncontrolling interests\n(\n471,119\n)\nGoodwill\n3,303,212\n \nTotal purchase consideration\n$\n4,269,620\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we made measurement-period adjustments that increased the amount of goodwill by $\n19.9\n million, primarily related to deferred income taxes as a result of finalizing the evaluation of the differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. The effects of the measurement-period adjustments on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2024 were not material. \nGoodwill arising from the acquisition was included in the Merchant Solutions segment and was attributable to expected growth opportunities, potential synergies from combining the acquired business into our existing businesses and an assembled workforce. We expect that approximately $\n1.2\n billion of the goodwill from this acquisition will be deductible for income tax purposes.\n82\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reflects the estimated acquisition-date fair values of the identified intangible assets of EVO and their respective weighted-average estimated amortization periods:\nEstimated Fair Value\nWeighted-Average Estimated Amortization Periods\n(in thousands)\n(years)\nCustomer-related intangible assets\n$\n916,000\n \n11\nContract-based intangible assets\n470,000\n \n12\nAcquired technologies\n86,995\n \n7\nTrademarks and trade names\n6,000\n \n2\nTotal estimated identifiable intangible assets\n$\n1,478,995\n \n11\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, and during the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2023, the acquired operations of EVO contributed less than \n10\n% to our consolidated revenues and operating income. The historical revenue and earnings of EVO were not material for the purpose of presenting pro forma information. In addition, transaction costs associated with this business combination were not material.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we completed other acquisitions that were insignificant, individually and in the aggregate, to the consolidated financial statements. For one of the acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2024, $\n47.3\n million of consideration is payable in the year ending December 31, 2025 and $\n8.8\n million is payable in the year ending December 31, 2026.  \nValuation of Identified Intangible Assets\nFor the acquisitions discussed above, the estimated fair values of customer-related and contract-based intangible assets were generally determined using the income approach, which was based on projected cash flows discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows. The discount rates used represented a risk adjusted market participant weighted-average cost of capital, derived using customary market metrics. Acquired technologies were valued using the replacement cost method, which required us to estimate the costs to construct an asset of equivalent utility at prices available at the time of the valuation analysis, with adjustments in value for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence. Trademarks and trade names were valued using the \"relief-from-royalty\" approach. This method assumes that trademarks and trade names have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method required us to estimate the future revenues for the related assets, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted-average cost of capital.\n \nNOTE 3—\nBUSINESS DISPOSITIONS\nAdvancedMD, Inc.\n - In December 2024, we completed the sale of AdvancedMD, Inc. (\"AdvancedMD\") for approximately $\n1\n billion, subject to certain closing adjustments, and up to $\n125\n million contingent upon the purchaser achieving certain specified returns. AdvancedMD is a provider of software-as-a-service solutions to small-to-medium sized ambulatory physician practices in the United States, and was included in our Merchant Solutions segment prior to disposition. We recognized a gain on the sale of $\n273.1\n million during the year ended December 31, 2024. \nGaming Business\n - In April 2023, we completed the sale of our gaming business for approximately $\n400\n million, subject to certain closing adjustments. The gaming business was included in our Merchant Solutions segment prior to disposition, and had been presented as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet since December 31, 2022. We recognized a \ngain on the sale\n of $\n106.9\n million during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n83\nTable of Contents\nConsumer Business\n - \nIn April 2023, we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our Netspend business for approximately $\n1\n billion, subject to certain closing adjustments. The consumer business comprised our former Consumer Solutions segment prior to disposition, and had been presented as held for sale with certain adjustments to report the disposal group at fair value less costs to sell in our consolidated balance sheet since June 30, 2022. We recognized a loss on this business disposition in our consolidated statements of income of $\n243.6\n million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The loss during the year ended December 31, 2023 included the effects of incremental negotiated closing adjustments, changes in the estimated fair value of the seller financing and the effects of the final tax structure of the transaction. We also recognized charges within net loss on business dispositions in our consolidated statements of income of $\n71.9\n million during the year ended December 31, 2022 to reduce the disposal group to estimated fair value less costs to sell, which related primarily to estimated costs to sell and changes in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate seller financing commitment. As further discussed in \"Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $\n833.1\n million during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to our former Business and Consumer Solutions reporting unit. \nNotes Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\n \nIn connection with the sale of our consumer business, we provided seller financing consisting of the following: (1) a first lien \nseven-year\n secured term loan facility with an aggregate principal amount of $\n350\n million bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of \n9.0\n%, including \n3.5\n% payable quarterly in cash and \n5.5\n% settled quarterly via the issuance of additional paid-in-kind (\"PIK\") notes with the same terms as the original notes until December 2024, after which interest will be payable quarterly in cash along with quarterly principal payments of $\n4.375\n million with the remaining balance due at maturity; and (2) a second lien \ntwenty-five year\n secured term loan facility with an aggregate principal amount of $\n325\n million bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of \n13.0\n% PIK due at maturity. The aggregate fair value of the first and second lien term loans upon the closing of the transaction was $\n653.9\n million, calculated using a discounted cash flow approach. In addition, during the second quarter of 2023, we provided the purchasers a \nfive-year\n $\n50\n million secured revolving facility, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of \n9.0\n% payable quarterly in cash, initial drawings on which were subsequently repaid during the third quarter of 2023. \nIn connection with the sale of our gaming business in April 2023, we provided seller financing consisting of an unsecured promissory note due April 1, 2030 with an aggregate principal amount of $\n32\n million bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of \n11.0\n%. \nWe recognized interest income of $\n89.9\n million on the notes during the year ended December 31, 2024 and $\n58.3\n million during the year ended December 31, 2023, as a component of interest and other income in the consolidated statements of income. The issuance of the notes in connection with the sale transactions was a noncash investing activity in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was an aggregate principal amount of $\n810.2\n million and $\n753.5\n million, respectively, outstanding on the notes, including PIK interest, and the notes are presented net of the allowance for credit losses of $\n15.2\n million within notes receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. Principal payments due within 12 months are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The estimated fair value of the notes receivable was $\n809.3\n million and $\n735.6\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated fair value of notes receivable was based on \na discounted cash flow approach and is considered to be a Level 3 measurement of the valuation hierarchy.\nSale of Merchant Solutions Business in Russia\n - \nWe sold our Merchant Solutions business in Russia in April 2022 for cash proceeds of $\n9\n million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a loss of $\n127.2\n million associated with the sale, comprised of the difference between the consideration received and the net carrying amount of the business and the reclassification of $\n62.9\n million of associated accumulated foreign currency translation losses from the separate component of equity.

On June 21, 2016, Visa Inc. (\"Visa\") acquired all of the membership interests in Visa Europe, and we received consideration in the form of cash and Series B and C convertible preferred shares of Visa. We assigned the preferred shares a value of \nzero\n based on transfer restrictions, Visa's ability to adjust the conversion rate and the estimation uncertainty associated with those factors. Based on the outcome of any current or potential litigation involving Visa Europe in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe, the conversion rate of the preferred shares could be adjusted down such that the number of Visa common shares we receive could be as low as \nzero\n. \nThe Series B and C convertible preferred shares become convertible in stages based on developments in the litigation and become fully convertible no later than 2028 (subject to a holdback to cover any then pending claims). In July 2022, in connection with the second mandatory release assessment, a portion of the Series B and C convertible preferred shares was converted by Visa. We recognized a gain of\n $\n13.2\n million\n reported in interest and other income in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022 based on the fair value of the shares received and subsequently sold.\nIn July 2024, in connection with the third mandatory release assessment, a portion of the Series B and C convertible preferred shares was converted by Visa. We recognized a gain of\n \n$\n18.8\n million reported in interest and other income in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2024 based on the fair value of the shares received and subsequently sold. The remaining Series B and C convertible preferred shares continue to be carried at an assigned value of \nzero\n based on the aforementioned factors.\nIn addition, through the acquisition of EVO in 2023, we obtained Series A and C convertible preferred shares of Visa. The Series C preferred shares are carried at an assigned value of \nzero\n based on the aforementioned factors. The Series A convertible preferred shares were not restricted and were convertible into a fixed number of Visa Class A common shares. In November 2023, the Series A convertible preferred shares were converted into a fixed number of Visa Class A common shares and sold for cash proceeds of $\n42.1\n million. Prior to sale, the Visa Class A common shares were presented at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in interest and other income in our consolidated statement of income.\n \n93\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 9—\nLONG-TERM DEBT AND LINES OF CREDIT\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, long-term debt consisted of the following:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in thousands)\nLong-term Debt\n1.500\n% senior notes due November 15, 2024\n$\n—\n \n$\n499,143\n \n2.650\n% senior notes due February 15, 2025\n999,791\n \n998,172\n \n1.200\n% senior notes due March 1, 2026\n1,097,764\n \n1,095,848\n \n4.800\n% senior notes due April 1, 2026\n764,125\n \n775,425\n \n2.150\n% senior notes due January 15, 2027\n747,447\n \n746,196\n \n4.950\n% senior notes due August 15, 2027\n497,425\n \n496,444\n \n4.450\n% senior notes due June 1, 2028\n465,012\n \n469,406\n \n3.200\n% senior notes due August 15, 2029\n1,242,715\n \n1,241,169\n \n5.300\n% senior notes due August 15, 2029\n496,762\n \n496,063\n \n2.900\n% senior notes due May 15, 2030\n993,708\n \n992,537\n \n2.900\n% senior notes due November 15, 2031\n744,233\n \n743,394\n \n5.400\n% senior notes due August 15, 2032\n743,730\n \n742,908\n \n4.150\n% senior notes due August 15, 2049\n741,215\n \n740,860\n \n5.950\n% senior notes due August 15, 2052\n738,975\n \n738,576\n \n4.875\n% senior notes due March 17, 2031\n820,952\n \n873,747\n \n1.000\n% convertible senior notes due August 15, 2029\n1,461,761\n \n1,453,493\n \n1.500\n% convertible senior notes due March 1, 2031\n1,970,577\n \n—\n \nRevolving credit facility\n1,500,000\n \n1,570,000\n \nCommercial paper notes\n—\n \n1,371,639\n \nFinance lease liabilities\n16,382\n \n24,525\n \nOther borrowings\n197,793\n \n243,337\n \nTotal long-term debt\n16,240,367\n \n16,312,882\n \nLess current portion\n1,075,708\n \n620,585\n \nLong-term debt, excluding current portion\n$\n15,164,659\n \n$\n15,692,297\n \nThe carrying amounts of our senior notes and convertible notes in the table above are presented net of unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs, as applicable.

(\"TSYS\") in September 2019 (the \"TSYS Merger\"). Interest on the senior notes is payable annually or semi-annually at various dates. Each series of the senior notes is redeemable, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at the redemption prices set forth in the related indenture.\nOn March 17, 2023, we issued €\n800\n million aggregate principal amount of \n4.875\n% senior unsecured notes due March 2031 and received net proceeds of €\n790.6\n million, or $\n843.6\n million based on the exchange rate on the issuance date. We issued the senior notes at a discount of $\n2.8\n million, and we incurred debt issuance costs of $\n7.2\n million, including underwriting fees, professional services fees and registration fees, which were capitalized and reflected as a reduction of the related carrying amount of the notes in our consolidated balance sheet.

Interest on the senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 for the 2024 and 2031 notes and January 15 and July 15 on the 2027 note, commencing May 15, 2022 for the 2024 note and the 2031 note and July 15, 2022 for the 2027 note. The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

Each series of the senior notes is redeemable, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at the redemption prices set forth in the related indenture. We issued the senior notes at a total discount of $\n6.1\n million and capitalized related debt issuance costs of $\n29.6\n million. \nIn addition, in connection with the TSYS Merger, we assumed $\n3.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes of TSYS, consisting of the following: (i) $\n750.0\n million aggregate principal amount of \n3.800\n% senior notes due 2021, which were redeemed in February 2021; (ii) $\n550.0\n million aggregate principal amount of \n3.750\n% senior notes due 2023, which were redeemed in June 2023; (iii) $\n550.0\n million aggregate principal amount of \n4.000\n% senior notes due 2023, which were redeemed in June 2023; (iv) $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of \n4.800\n% senior notes due 2026; and (v) $\n450\n million aggregate principal amount of \n4.450\n% senior notes due 2028.

For the \n4.450\n% senior notes due 2028, interest is payable semi-annually each June 1 and December 1. The difference between the acquisition-date fair value and face value of senior notes assumed in the TSYS Merger is recognized over the terms of the respective notes as a reduction of interest expense. The amortization of this fair value adjustment was $\n15.7\n million, $\n15.7\n million, and $\n27.4\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n96\nTable of Contents\nConvertible Notes\n1.500\n% Convertible Notes due March 1, 2031\nOn February 23, 2024, we issued $\n2.0\n billion in aggregate principal amount of \n1.500\n% convertible senior notes due March 2031 through a private placement. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $\n1.97\n billion reflecting debt issuance costs of $\n33.5\n million, which were capitalized and reflected as a reduction of the related carrying amount of the convertible notes in our consolidated balance sheet. Interest on the convertible notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024, to the holders of record on the preceding February 15 and August 15, respectively. \nPrior to December 1, 2030, the notes are convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions, including: (i) if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least \n130\n% of the conversion price for at least \n20\n trading days within the last \n30\n consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (ii) for a \nfive\n business day period following a \nten\n-day consecutive trading period where the trading price of the notes is less than \n98\n% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate; (iii) if we call any or all of the notes for redemption; or (iv) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events. On or after December 1, 2030, the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the second scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date. The notes are convertible into cash and shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of 6.371 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes (which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $\n156.96\n per share), subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. Upon conversion, the principal amount of, and interest due on, the convertible notes are required to be settled in cash and any other amounts may be settled in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash at our election.\nWe may not redeem the notes prior to March 6, 2028. On or after March 6, 2028, we have the option to redeem all or any portion of the notes for cash if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least \n130\n% of the conversion price for at least \n20\n trading days within the last \n30\n consecutive trading day period at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If certain corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occur, any holder of the notes may require that we repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a purchase price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occur, then the conversion rate will in certain circumstances be increased. The notes include customary covenants for notes of this type, as well as customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the convertible notes.\nIn connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the notes and other financial institutions to cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the notes. The economic effect of the capped call transactions is to hedge the potential dilutive effect upon the conversion of the notes, or offset our cash obligation if the cash settlement option is elected, for amounts in excess of the principal amount of converted notes subject to a cap. The initial cap price of the capped call transactions is $\n228.90\n per share. The capped call transactions meet the accounting criteria to be reflected in stockholders’ equity and not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of $\n256.3\n million incurred in connection with the capped call transactions was reflected as a reduction to paid-in-capital in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, net of applicable income taxes.\n1.000\n% Convertible Notes due August 15, 2029\nOn August 8, 2022, we issued $\n1.5\n billion in aggregate principal amount of \n1.000\n% convertible unsecured senior notes due August 2029 in a private placement pursuant to an investment agreement with Silver Lake Partners. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $\n1.44\n billion, reflecting an issuance discount of $\n37.5\n million and $\n20.4\n million of debt issuance costs, which were capitalized and reflected as a reduction of the related carrying amount of the convertible notes in our consolidated balance sheet. Interest on the convertible notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2023, to the holders of record on the preceding February 1 and August 1, respectively. \n97\nTable of Contents\nThe notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time after the date that is \n18\n months after issuance (or earlier, upon the occurrence of certain corporate events) until the scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date and are presented within long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet based on our intent and ability to refinance on a long-term basis should a conversion event occur. The notes are convertible into cash and shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of 7.1727 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes (which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $\n139.42\n per share), subject to customary anti-dilution and other adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. Upon conversion, the principal amount of, and interest due on, the convertible notes are required to be settled in cash and any other amounts may be settled in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash at our election. \nThe notes are not redeemable by us. If certain corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occur, any holder of the notes may require that we repurchase all or any portion of their notes for cash at a purchase price of par plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) occur, then the conversion rate will in certain circumstances be increased for a specified period of time. The notes include customary covenants for notes of this type, as well as customary events of default, which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the convertible notes.\nOn August 8, 2022, in connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions to cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the notes. The economic effect of the capped call transactions is to hedge the potential dilutive effect upon conversion of the notes, or offset our cash obligation if the cash settlement option is elected, up to a cap price determined based on a hedging period that commenced on August 9, 2022 and concluded on August 25, 2022. The capped call had an initial strike price of $\n140.67\n per share and a cap price of $\n229.26\n per share. The capped call transactions meet the accounting criteria to be reflected in stockholders’ equity and not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of $\n302.4\n million incurred in connection with the capped call transactions was reflected as a reduction to paid-in-capital in our consolidated statement of changes in equity during the year ended December 31, 2022, net of applicable income taxes.\n Revolving Credit Facility\nOn August 19, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions, as lenders and other agents. The credit agreement provides for an unsubordinated unsecured $\n5.75\n billion revolving credit facility. We capitalized debt issuance costs of $\n12.3\n million in connection with the issuances under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility matures in August 2027. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid prior to maturity without premium or penalty, subject to payment of certain customary expenses of lenders and customary notice provisions.\nBorrowings under the revolving credit facility are available to be made in US dollars, euros, sterling, Canadian dollars and, subject to certain conditions, certain other currencies at our option. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) for SOFR based currencies or certain alternative currencies, a secured overnight financing rate (subject to a \n0.00\n% floor) plus a \n0.10\n% credit spread adjustment or an alternative currency term rate (subject to a \n0.00\n% floor), as applicable, (ii) for US dollar borrowings, a base rate, (iii) for US dollar borrowings, a daily floating secured overnight financing rate (subject to a \n0.00\n% floor on or after January 1, 2023) plus a \n0.10\n% credit spread adjustment or (iv) for certain alternative currencies, a daily alternative currency rate (subject to a \n0.00\n% floor), in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility will range from \n1.125\n% to \n1.875\n% depending on our credit rating. In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee with respect to the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at an applicable rate per annum ranging from \n0.125\n% to \n0.300\n% depending on our credit rating.\nWe may issue standby letters of credit of up to $\n250\n million in the aggregate under the revolving credit facility. Outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us. The amounts available to borrow under the revolving credit facility are also determined by a financial leverage covenant. As of December 31, 2024, there were borrowings of $\n1.5\n billion outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an interest rate of \n5.86\n%, and the total available commitments under the revolving credit facility were $\n3.7\n billion.\n98\nTable of Contents\nCommercial Paper\nWe have a $\n2.0\n billion commercial paper program under which we may issue senior unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities of up to \n397\n days from the date of issue. Commercial paper notes are expected to be issued at a discount from par, or they may bear interest, each at commercial paper market rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. The proceeds from issuances of commercial paper notes will be used primarily for general corporate purposes but may also be used for acquisitions, to pay dividends, for debt refinancing or for other purposes.\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had \nno\n borrowings outstanding under our comm\nercial paper program. The commercial program is backstopped by our revolving credit agreement, in that the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding cannot exceed the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility. As suc\nh, we could draw on the revolving credit facility to repay commercial paper notes that cannot be rolled over or refinanced with similar debt\n.\nPrior Credit Facility\nPrior to the revolving credit facility, we were party to a prior credit facility agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions, as lenders and other agents (as amended from time to time). The prior credit facility provided for a senior unsecured $\n2.0\n billion term loan facility and a senior unsecured $\n3.0\n billion revolving credit facility. In August 2022, all borrowings outstanding and other amounts due under the prior credit facility were repaid and the prior credit facility was terminated.\nBridge Facility\nOn August 1, 2022, in connection with our entry into the EVO merger agreement, we obtained commitments for a $\n4.3\n billion, \n364-day\n senior unsecured bridge facility. Upon the execution of permanent financing, including the issuance of our senior unsecured notes and entry into the revolving credit facility described above, the aggregate commitments under the bridge facility were reduced to zero and terminated. \nFair Value of Long-Term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2024, our senior notes had a total carrying amount of $\n11.1\n billion and an estimated fair value of $\n10.5\n billion. As of December 31, 2024, our \n1.500\n% convertible senior notes due March 1, 2031 had a total carrying amount of $\n2.0\n billion and an estimated fair value of $\n2.0\n billion. The estimated fair value of our senior notes and \n1.500\n% convertible senior notes were based on quoted market prices in an active market and is considered to be a Level 1 measurement of the valuation hierarchy. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our \n1.000\n% convertible notes had a total carrying amount of $\n1.5\n billion and an estimated fair value of $\n1.6\n billion. The estimated fair value of our \n1.000\n% convertible notes was based on a lattice pricing model and is considered to be a Level 3 measurement of the valuation hierarchy.\nThe fair value of other long-term debt approximated its carrying amount at December 31, 2024.\nCompliance with Covenants\nThe convertible notes include customary covenants and events of default for convertible notes of this type. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on net leverage and interest coverage ratios, and customary events of default. The required leverage ratio was increased as a result of the acquisition of EVO and will gradually step-down over \neight\n quarters to the original required ratio of \n3.75\n to 1.00. As of December 31, 2024, the required leverage ratio was \n4.00\n to 1.00, and the required interest coverage ratio was \n3.00\n to 1.00. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2024.\n99\nTable of Contents\nSettlement Lines of Credit\nIn various markets where our Merchant Solutions segment does business, we have specialized lines of credit, which are restricted for use in funding settlement. The settlement lines of credit generally have variable interest rates, are subject to annual review and are denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. For certain of our lines of credit, the available credit is increased by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender. Accordingly, the amount of the outstanding lines of credit may exceed the stated credit limit. As of December 31, 2024, a total of $\n71.2\n million of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $\n503.4\n million outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity to fund settlement of $\n2,280.3\n million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the maximum and average outstanding balances under these lines of credit were $\n1,283.4\n million and $\n502.7\n million, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was \n5.24\n% at December 31, 2024.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $\n619.5\n million, $\n629.8\n million and $\n437.0\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNOTE 10—\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS\nNet Investment Hedge\nWe have designated our aggregate €\n800\n million Euro-denominated \n4.875\n% senior notes due March 2031 as a hedge of our net investment in our Euro-denominated operations. The purpose of the net investment hedge is to reduce the volatility of our net investment in our Euro-denominated operations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nInvestments in foreign operations with functional currencies other than the reporting currency are subject to foreign currency risk as the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into the reporting currency at the period-end rate of exchange with the resulting foreign currency translation adjustment presented as a component of other comprehensive income and included in accumulated comprehensive income within equity in our consolidated balance sheets. Under net investment hedge accounting, the foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses associated with our Euro-denominated senior notes are presented within the same components of other comprehensive income and accumulated comprehensive income, partially offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment for our foreign subsidiaries. \nWe recognized a gain (loss) on the net investment hedge of $\n28.9\n million and $(\n27.0\n) million within foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nInterest Rate Swaps\nWe have interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to hedge changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate risk on a portion of our variable-rate debt instruments. In the first quarter of 2023, we entered into new interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $\n1.5\n billion to convert eligible borrowings under our revolving credit facility from a floating term Secured Overnight Financing Rate to a fixed rate. Net amounts to be received or paid under the swap agreements are reflected as adjustments to interest expense. Since we have designated the interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges, unrealized gains or losses resulting from adjusting the swaps to fair value are recognized as components of other comprehensive income. The fair values of our interest rate swaps are determined based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows using implied rates in the applicable yield curve as of the valuation date. These derivative instruments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. \n100\nTable of Contents\nIn August 2022, in connection with entry into the revolving credit agreement and repayment of amounts outstanding under our prior credit facility, we terminated and settled our interest rate swap agreements existing at that time. The termination resulted in the recognition of a net gain of $\n1.2\n million, including the reclassification of $\n0.5\n million of accumulated losses from the separate component of equity. The net gain was presented in interest and other expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. \nUpon issuance of our senior unsecured notes in August 2019, we made settlement payments of $\n48.3\n million related to the termination of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, for which the effective portion of the unrealized losses on the swaps was included in other comprehensive loss. We have and will continue to reclassify the effective portion of the realized loss from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense over the terms of the related senior notes.\nThe table below presents information about our interest rate swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, included in the consolidated balance sheets:\nFair Values\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nBalance Sheet Location\nWeighted-Average Fixed Rate of Interest at December 31, 2024\nRange of Maturity Dates at December 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in thousands)\nInterest rate swaps (Notional of $\n1.5\n billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023)\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n4.26\n \n%\nApril 17, 2027 - August 17, 2027\n$\n7,768\n \n$\n28,187\n \nThe table below presents the effects of our interest rate swaps on the consolidated statements of income and statements of comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nNet unrealized gains (losses) recognized in other comprehensive loss\n$\n34,399\n \n$\n(\n19,683\n)\n$\n12,915\n \nNet unrealized gains (losses) reclassified out of other comprehensive loss to interest expense\n$\n8,731\n \n$\n4,609\n \n$\n(\n21,327\n)\nAs of December 31, 2024, the amount of net unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our interest rate swaps that is expected to be reclassified into interest expense during the next 12 months was $\n6.5\n million.\n101\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 11—\nACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\n \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts payable and accrued liabilities consisted of the following:\n \n \n2024\n2023\n \n(in thousands)\nFunds held for customers\n$\n938,416\n \n$\n817,180\n \nTrade accounts payable\n320,085\n \n290,437\n \nCompensation and benefits\n248,970\n \n276,441\n \nContract liabilities\n242,769\n \n229,686\n \nPayment network fees\n222,621\n \n246,102\n \nIncome taxes\n209,037\n \n139,825\n \nInterest\n171,220\n \n166,039\n \nThird-party commissions\n87,431\n \n93,387\n \nOperating leases\n71,607\n \n81,696\n \nMiscellaneous taxes and withholdings\n69,523\n \n59,601\n \nThird-party processing fees\n36,251\n \n29,593\n \nUnclaimed property\n24,413\n \n22,560\n \nAudit and legal\n22,995\n \n22,748\n \nCurrent portion of accrued buyout liability\n(1)\n14,358\n \n13,719\n \nOther\n400,228\n \n335,965\n \n$\n3,079,924\n \n$\n2,824,979\n \n(1) \nThe noncurrent portion of accrued buyout liability of $\n23.5\n million and $\n69.1\n million is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, certain actions were taken to align our workforce to our new operating model.

The purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased in such transactions equaled the closing price of the common stock on February 20, 2024, which was $\n130.80\n per share. The share repurchase activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 also included the repurchase of \n5,320,781\n shares at an average price of $\n112.77\n per share under an ASR agreement we entered into on October 30, 2024 with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of $\n600.0\n million of our common stock during the ASR program purchase period. This ASR program was completed on December 20, 2024. On February 13, 2025, we entered into an ASR agreement to repurchase an aggregate $\n250.0\n million of shares of common stock during the program purchase period, which will end prior to March 31, 2025. The total number of shares to be repurchased under the program will generally be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the repurchase period less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms of the program.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act into law, which, among other things, implemented a 1% excise tax on share repurchases effective beginning January 1, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we reflected excise taxes of $\n15.6\n million and $\n3.9\n million, respectively, within equity as part of the cost of common stock repurchased, net of share issuances, during the period.\n107\nTable of Contents\nOn October 24, 2024, our board of directors approved an increase to our existing share repurchase program authorization, which raised the total available authorization to $\n2.5\n billion. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining amount available under our share repurchase program was $\n1,850.0\n million.\nOn January 30, 2025, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $\n0.25\n per share payable on March 28, 2025 to common shareholders of record as of March 14, 2025.\nNOTE 14—\nSHARE-BASED AWARDS AND OPTIONS\nWe have granted nonqualified stock options, restricted stock and performance unit awards to key employees, officers and directors under a long-term incentive plan, which permits grants of equity to employees, officers, directors and consultants. A total of \n14.0\n million shares of our common stock has been reserved and made available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2011 Amended and Restated Incentive Plan.\nThe following table summarizes share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit recognized for our share-based awards and stock options:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nShare-based compensation expense\n$\n164,244\n \n$\n208,994\n \n$\n163,261\n \nIncome tax benefit\n$\n35,528\n \n$\n48,446\n \n$\n38,059\n \nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock awards vest in approximately equal annual installments, generally on each of the first \nthree\n or \nfour\n anniversaries of the grant date or, in some cases, in one installment on the third anniversary of the grant date, in either case subject to the holder's continued service on each applicable vesting date. Restricted shares cannot be sold or transferred until they have vested. The grant date fair value of restricted stock awards, which is based on the quoted market value of our common stock on the grant date, is recognized as share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Our restricted stock agreements provide for accelerated vesting under certain conditions.\nPerformance Units\nCertain of our executives have been granted performance-based restricted stock units (\"performance units\") that, after a specified performance period, may convert on a \n1\n-for-1 basis into shares of our common stock based upon the level of achievement of certain pre-established performance measures during the performance period and subject to the holders' continued service on the vesting date. The Compensation Committee of our board of directors (\"Compensation Committee\") establishes performance measures and may set a range of possible performance-based outcomes for performance units. Performance units are converted into shares of common stock only after the Compensation Committee certifies the level of achievement against the performance measures. Our performance unit agreements provide for accelerated vesting under certain conditions.\nFor these awards, we recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable performance or service period using the grant date fair value of the award and the number of shares expected to be earned according to the level of achievement of performance measures. When the estimated number of common shares expected to be earned is changed during the performance period, we make a cumulative adjustment to share-based compensation expense based on the revised estimate. The performance periods for awards granted generally range from \none\n to \nthree years\n.\n108\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the changes in unvested restricted stock awards and performance units for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nShares\nWeighted-Average\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\n(in thousands)\nUnvested at December 31, 2021\n1,640\n \n$\n184.90\nGranted\n1,496\n \n137.51\nVested\n(\n756\n)\n170.79\nForfeited\n(\n235\n)\n164.06\nUnvested at December 31, 2022\n2,145\n \n159.04\nReplacement Awards\n202\n \n98.44\nGranted\n1,322\n \n112.81\nVested\n(\n1,041\n)\n157.33\nForfeited\n(\n147\n)\n128.18\nUnvested at December 31, 2023\n2,481\n \n131.41\nGranted\n1,225\n \n128.97\nVested\n(\n1,224\n)\n140.79\nForfeited\n(\n230\n)\n119.07\nUnvested at December 31, 2024\n2,252\n \n$\n126.07\nThe total fair value of restricted stock and performance units vested was $\n172.3\n million, $\n163.8\n million and $\n129.2\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nFor restricted stock and performance units, we recognized compensation expense of $\n151.6\n million, $\n186.9\n million and $\n151.5\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there was $\n131.8\n million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock awards and performance units that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of \n1.8\n years. \nStock Options\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to \n100\n% of fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and have a term of \nten years\n. Stock options vest in equal installments, generally on each of the first \nthree\n or \nfour\n anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the holder's continued service on each applicable vesting date. Our stock option agreements provide for accelerated vesting under certain conditions.\n109\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes changes in stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022: \nOptions\nWeighted-Average Exercise Price\nWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term\nAggregate Intrinsic Value\n(in thousands)\n(years)\n(in millions)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021\n1,172\n \n$\n107.44\n5.8\n$\n47.4\nGranted\n154\n \n136.02\nForfeited\n(\n89\n)\n147.65\nExercised\n(\n98\n)\n65.69\n5.5\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022\n1,139\n \n111.75\n5.4\n17.3\nReplacement Awards\n142\n \n98.44\nGranted\n233\n \n110.83\nForfeited\n(\n297\n)\n155.35\nExercised\n(\n296\n)\n89.08\n9.4\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n921\n \n99.54\n5.0\n32.1\nGranted\n168\n \n127.99\nForfeited\n(\n77\n)\n150.55\nExercised\n(\n234\n)\n59.16\n16.0\nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n778\n \n$\n112.91\n5.5\n$\n9.0\nOptions vested and exercisable at December 31, 2024\n521\n \n$\n110.07\n4.0\n$\n7.9\nWe recognized compensation expense for stock options of $\n7.5\n million, $\n17.0\n million and $\n6.4\n million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had $\n7.4\n million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of \n1.9\n years.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted, including replacement awards granted in connection with the EVO acquisition, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n53.19\n, $\n46.17\n and $\n48.88\n, respectively. \nFair value was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.13\n%\n3.84\n%\n1.87\n%\nExpected volatility\n45\n%\n45\n%\n40\n%\nDividend yield\n0.90\n%\n0.81\n%\n0.56\n%\nExpected term (years)\n5\n5\n5\nThe risk-free interest rate was based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant. Our assumption on expected volatility was based on our historical volatility. The dividend yield assumption was determined using our average stock price over the preceding year and the annualized amount of our most current quarterly dividend per share. We based our assumptions on the expected term of the options on our analysis of the historical exercise patterns of the options and our assumption on the future exercise pattern of options.\n110\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 15—\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nSupplemental cash flow disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in thousands)\nIncome taxes paid, net of refunds\n$\n523,263\n \n$\n640,784\n \n$\n431,148\n \nInterest paid\n$\n618,865\n \n$\n603,486\n \n$\n350,075\n \nNOTE 16—\nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n$\n73,788\n \n$\n42,590\n \n$\n31,820\n \nForeign currency translation attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(\n54,468\n)\n50,397\n \n(\n13,301\n)\nComprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n$\n19,320\n \n$\n92,987\n \n$\n18,519\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid $\n108.8\n million to acquire the remaining \n45.23\n% interest for \n100\n% ownership in one of our majority-owned subsidiaries in Europe. The transaction resulted in a reduction in equity attributable to noncontrolling interests of approximately $\n37.7\n million and a reduction in total equity attributable to Global Payments of approximately $\n71.1\n million. The net effects of the transaction include a reclassification of an accumulated other comprehensive gain related to foreign currency translation of $\n0.7\n million from noncontrolling interests to equity attributable to Global Payments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we received $\n26.2\n million from a noncontrolling shareholder in exchange for a \n20\n% ownership interest in \none\n of our majority-owned subsidiaries in Spain, which resulted in a reallocation between equity attributable to Global Payments and equity attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nThe portions of equity in certain of our consolidated subsidiaries that are not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us, are redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. \nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we formed a new joint venture in Germany, of which we hold a \n51\n% controlling interest. Under the shareholder agreement, the minority shareholder has the option to compel us to purchase their shares at fair market value upon the occurrence of a specific change in control event. As of December 31, 2024, the option is not considered probable of becoming redeemable. We also own \n51\n% of our subsidiary in Greece and \n50.1\n% of our subsidiary in Chile. Under the respective shareholder agreements, the minority shareholders have the option to compel us to purchase their shares at a price per share based on the fair value of the shares, or under certain circumstances for our subsidiary in Greece, at a price determined by calculations stipulated in the shareholder agreement. The options have no expiration date.\nBecause the exercise of each of these redemption options is not solely within our control, the redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented in the mezzanine section between total liabilities and shareholders’ equity, as temporary equity, in our consolidated balance sheets. The redeemable noncontrolling interest for each subsidiary is reflected at the higher of: (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest's share of comprehensive income (loss), capital contributions and distributions or (ii) the redemption price. \n111\nTable of Contents\nThe option held by the minority shareholder in Greece, which is redeemable at a price other than fair value, is considered probable of becoming redeemable on December 8, 2025. In determining the measurement method of redemption price, we have elected to accrete changes in the redemption price over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the instrument using the effective interest method, applied prospectively, which amounted to $\n20.0\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024. We have also elected to recognize the entire amount of any redemption price adjustments in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income.  \nIn addition, we own \n66\n% of our subsidiary in Poland. The redemption option held by the minority shareholder in Poland expired on January 1, 2024, and the redeemable noncontrolling interest was reclassified to nonredeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2024.\nNOTE 17—\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nThe changes in the accumulated balances for each component of other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nForeign Currency Translation Gains (Losses)\nNet Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Hedging Activities\nOther\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\n(in thousands)\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n$\n(\n182,949\n)\n$\n(\n48,490\n)\n$\n(\n2,743\n)\n$\n(\n234,182\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n197,635\n)\n26,070\n \n(\n222\n)\n(\n171,787\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n(\n380,584\n)\n(\n22,420\n)\n(\n2,965\n)\n(\n405,969\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n165,044\n \n(\n18,439\n)\n439\n \n147,044\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n(\n215,540\n)\n(\n40,859\n)\n(\n2,526\n)\n(\n258,925\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n374,388\n)\n19,441\n \n141\n \n(\n354,806\n)\nEffect of purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interest\n739\n \n—\n \n—\n \n739\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n(\n589,189\n)\n$\n(\n21,418\n)\n$\n(\n2,385\n)\n$\n(\n612,992\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, which relates only to foreign currency translation, was $(\n54.5\n) million, $\n50.4\n million and $(\n13.3\n) million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \nNOTE 18—\nSEGMENT INFORMATION \nInformation About Profit and Assets\nWe operate in \ntwo\n reportable segments: Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions. As described in \"Note 3—Business Dispositions,\" during the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of the consumer portion of our Netspend business, which comprised our former Consumer Solutions segment. Our former Consumer Solutions segment is presented below for periods prior to disposition.\nOur Merchant Solutions payment technology is similar around the world in that we enable our customers to accept card and other digital-based payments. Through this segment, our offerings include, but are not limited to, authorization, settlement and funding services, customer support, chargeback resolution, terminal rental, sales and deployment, payment security services, consolidated billing and on-line reporting. In addition, we offer a wide array of enterprise software solutions that streamline business operations to customers in numerous vertical markets. We also provide a variety of value-added solutions and services, including specialty point-of-sale software, analytics and customer engagement, human capital management and payroll and reporting that assist our customers with driving demand and operating their businesses more efficiently.\n112\nTable of Contents\nThrough our Issuer Solutions segment, we provide financial institutions and retailers technologies to manage their card portfolios, reduce technical complexity and overhead and offer a seamless experience for cardholders on a single platform. In addition, we provide flexible commercial payments, accounts payable and electronic payment alternative solutions that support B2B payment processes for businesses and governments. We also offer complementary services including account management and servicing, fraud solution services, analytics and business intelligence, cards, statements and correspondence, customer contact services and risk management solutions. Additionally, our Issuer Solutions segment provides B2B payment services and other financial service solutions marketed to businesses, including SaaS offerings that automate key procurement processes, provide invoice capture, coding and approval, and enable virtual cards and integrated payments options across a variety of key vertical markets.\nThrough our former Consumer Solutions segment, we provided general purpose reloadable prepaid debit and payroll cards, demand deposit accounts and other financial service solutions to the underbanked and other consumers and businesses in the United States. \nOur segment structure reflects the financial information and reports used by our chief operating decision maker to make decisions regarding the business, including resource allocations and performance assessments. Our Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"). We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on the operating income of each operating segment. The CODM uses segment operating income in the annual budget and forecasting process, and considers budget-to-actual and forecast-to-actual variances on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. The operating income of each operating segment includes the revenues of the segment less expenses that are directly related to those revenues. Operating overhead, shared costs and share-based compensation costs are included in Corporate. Impairment of goodwill and gains or losses on business dispositions are not included in determining segment operating income. Interest and other income, interest and other expense, income tax expense and equity in income of equity method investments are not allocated to the individual segments. The CODM does not evaluate the performance of or allocate resources to our operating segments using asset data. The accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in \"Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\n113\nTable of Contents\nInformation on segments and reconciliations to consolidated revenues, consolidated operating expenses, consolidated operating income and consolidated depreciation and amortization were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nRevenues\n(1)\n:\nMerchant Solutions\n$\n7,688,703\n \n$\n7,151,793\n \n$\n6,204,917\n \nIssuer Solutions\n2,483,657\n \n2,398,870\n \n2,245,623\n \nConsumer Solutions\n—\n \n182,740\n \n620,482\n \nIntersegment eliminations\n(\n66,466\n)\n(\n78,984\n)\n(\n95,507\n)\nConsolidated revenues\n$\n10,105,894\n \n$\n9,654,419\n \n$\n8,975,515\n \nOperating expenses\n(1)\n:\nMerchant Solutions:\nCost of service\n$\n2,008,126\n \n$\n1,925,880\n \n$\n1,798,300\n \nSelling, general and administrative\n3,067,662\n \n2,880,658\n \n2,366,362\n \nTotal Merchant Solutions expenses\n5,075,788\n \n4,806,538\n \n4,164,662\n \nIssuer Solutions:\nCost of service\n1,795,001\n \n1,738,047\n \n1,633,708\n \nSelling, general and administrative\n246,214\n \n251,016\n \n255,700\n \nTotal Issuer Solutions expenses\n2,041,215\n \n1,989,063\n \n1,889,408\n \nConsumer Solutions\n(2)\n—\n \n186,648\n \n566,888\n \nCorporate\n994,886\n \n898,024\n \n777,744\n \nIntersegment eliminations\n(\n66,466\n)\n(\n78,984\n)\n(\n95,507\n)\nOperating income (loss)\n(1)\n:\nMerchant Solutions\n$\n2,612,915\n \n$\n2,345,255\n \n$\n2,040,255\n \nIssuer Solutions\n442,442\n \n409,807\n \n356,215\n \nConsumer Solutions\n—\n \n(\n3,908\n)\n53,594\n \nCorporate\n(\n994,886\n)\n(\n898,024\n)\n(\n777,744\n)\nImpairment of goodwill\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n833,075\n)\nNet gain (loss) on business dispositions\n273,134\n \n(\n136,744\n)\n(\n199,094\n)\nConsolidated operating income\n$\n2,333,605\n \n$\n1,716,386\n \n$\n640,151\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n(1)\n:\nMerchant Solutions\n$\n1,179,845\n \n$\n1,109,186\n \n$\n981,297\n \nIssuer Solutions\n658,186\n \n646,118\n \n623,755\n \nConsumer Solutions\n—\n \n—\n \n35,773\n \nCorporate\n24,300\n \n21,388\n \n21,630\n \nConsolidated depreciation and amortization\n$\n1,862,331\n \n$\n1,776,692\n \n$\n1,662,455\n \n(1) \nRevenues, operating expenses, operating income and depreciation and amortization reflect the effects of acquired businesses from the respective acquisition dates and the effects of disposed businesses through the respective disposal dates.

Certain of the agreements included the purchase of assets previously leased.\nLegal Matters\nWe are party to a number of claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. In our opinion, the liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from the outcome of such matters, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\n \nOperating Taxes\nWe are subject to certain taxes that are not derived based on earnings (e.g., sales, gross receipts, property, value-added and other business taxes). During the course of operations, we must interpret the meaning of various operating tax regulations in the United States and in the foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. We are subject to ongoing audits in certain jurisdictions, and taxing authorities in those various jurisdictions may arrive at different interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations which could result in the payment of additional taxes in those jurisdictions.\nBIN/ICA Agreements\nIn certain markets, we enter into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with banks. These agreements allow us to use the banks' identification numbers, referred to as Bank Identification Number (\"BIN\") for Visa transactions and an Interbank Card Association (\"ICA\") number for Mastercard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through Visa and Mastercard. Certain of these agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2024.\n116\nTable of Contents\nGLOBAL PAYMENTS INC.\nSCHEDULE II\n \nValuation and Qualifying Accounts\n(in thousands)\n \n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\nDescription\nBalance at\n \nBeginning of Period\n \n  \nAdditions: Charged to\n \nCosts and\n \nExpenses\n(2)\n  \nDeductions: Uncollectible Accounts Write-Offs (Recoveries)\n  \nBalance at\n \nEnd\n \nof Period\n \nAllowance for credit losses - accounts receivable\nDecember 31, 2022\n$\n17,389\n \n$\n14,951\n \n$\n11,320\n \n$\n21,020\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n(3)\n$\n21,020\n \n$\n23,267\n \n$\n25,282\n \n$\n19,005\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n(4)\n$\n19,005\n \n$\n25,027\n \n$\n19,327\n \n$\n24,705\n \nAllowance for credit losses - settlement assets\n (1)\nDecember 31, 2022\n$\n2,974\n \n$\n12,984\n \n$\n13,671\n \n$\n2,287\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n$\n2,287\n \n$\n19,242\n \n$\n11,799\n \n$\n9,730\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n$\n9,730\n \n$\n22,387\n \n$\n22,161\n \n$\n9,956\n \nReserve for sales allowances\nDecember 31, 2022\n$\n8,516\n \n$\n24,517\n \n$\n25,073\n \n$\n7,960\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n$\n7,960\n \n$\n29,498\n \n$\n28,425\n \n$\n9,033\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n$\n9,033\n \n$\n29,906\n \n$\n28,811\n \n$\n10,128\n \nAllowance for credit and operating losses - check guarantee\nDecember 31, 2022\n$\n2,536\n \n$\n12,291\n \n$\n11,383\n \n$\n3,444\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n(3)\n$\n3,444\n \n$\n3,074\n \n$\n6,518\n \n$\n—\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nReserve for contract contingencies and processing errors\nDecember 31, 2022\n$\n1,337\n \n$\n1,212\n \n$\n972\n \n$\n1,577\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n$\n1,577\n \n$\n3,194\n \n$\n3,158\n \n$\n1,613\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n$\n1,613\n \n$\n2,666\n \n$\n2,872\n \n$\n1,407\n \nReserve for cardholder losses\nDecember 31, 2022\n$\n10,058\n \n$\n58,673\n \n$\n58,541\n \n$\n10,190\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n(3)\n$\n10,190\n \n$\n15,861\n \n$\n26,051\n \n$\n—\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nDeferred income tax asset valuation allowance\nDecember 31, 2022\n$\n112,259\n \n$\n(\n2,216\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n110,043\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n$\n110,043\n \n$\n104,280\n \n$\n3,274\n \n$\n211,049\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n$\n211,049\n \n$\n30,148\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n241,197\n \nAllowance for credit losses - notes receivable\nDecember 31, 2023\n$\n—\n \n$\n15,245\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n15,245\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n$\n15,245\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n15,245\n \n117\nTable of Contents\n(1)\n Included in settlement processing obligations.\n(2)\n In addition to amounts charged to costs and expenses, amounts in this column include additions, as applicable, resulting from business combinations.\n(3)\n Includes certain amounts related to our consumer and gaming business disposal groups that were presented as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the\n Internal Control \n—\n Integrated Framework (2013)\n.\nBased on the results of its evaluation, management believes that as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Due to such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, such risk.\n \nAttestation Report of Public Accounting Firm \nDeloitte & Touche LLP has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein as the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm under \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n118\nTable of Contents\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nITEM 9B - OTHER INFORMATION \n \n(b) Insider Trading Plans and Arrangements \nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, none of our directors or officers notified us that they \nadopted\n, modified or \nterminated\n any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9C - DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS \n \nNot Applicable.\n119\nTable of Contents\nPART III\nITEM 10 - DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE \n \nWe incorporate by reference in this Item 10 information about our directors, executive officers and our corporate governance contained under the headings \"Proposal 1: Election of Directors for a One-Year Term,\" \"Biographical Information About Executive Officers,\" \"Anti-Hedging Policy; Insider Trading Policy\" and \"Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports\" from our proxy statement to be delivered in connection with our Proxy Statement and Notice of 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 24, 2025 (our \"2025 Proxy Statement\").\n \nWe have adopted codes of ethics that apply to our senior financial officers.
