  "item1_summary": " The profitability of the Companies’ businesses is dependent on their ability, through the rates that they are permitted to charge, to recover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital investment . At the state level, Virginia Power’s retail base rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services are based on state and federal regulatory agencies . A failure by the Companies to support these rates could result in rate decreases from current rate levels .\n Legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023 reset the frequency of base rate reviews to a biennial period commencing with the 2023 Biennial Review . Virginia Power may be required to refund a portion of its earnings to customers through a refund process and to reduce its rates . Dominion Energy’s rates for gas distribution to retail customers are similarly regulated at the state level .\n The Companies’ generation stations operating in RTO markets sell capacity, energy and ancillary services into wholesale electricity markets regulated by FERC . The wholesale markets allow these generation stations to take advantage of market price opportunities, but also expose them to market risk . Properly functioning competitive wholesale markets depend upon FERC’s continuation of clearly identified market rules .\n The Companies’ operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations . Failure to comply with these market manipulation rules could lead to civil and criminal penalties . Management believes that the necessary approvals have been obtained for existing operations and that the businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws . New laws or regulations, the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws, the imposition of new tariffs, changes in enforcement practices of regulators .\n Recent legislative and regulatory changes that are impacting the Companies include legislation enacted in Virginia in April 2023, the IRA, the VCEA, the 2017 Tax Reform Act and tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the U.S. government in 2018 . Adverse developments in tax laws, credits or other incentives could result in material modifications to business models .\n Virginia has adopted the VCEA which establishes renewable energy and CO2 reduction targets . 100% of Virginia Power’s electricity come from zero-carbon generation by the end of 2045 . The legislation mandates the development of 16.1 GW of solar or onshore wind capacity by 2035 . Virginia also authorizes Virginia to participate in a program consistent with RGGI, requiring the purchase of carbon credits to offset emissions .\n In February 2020, Dominion Energy announced its commitment to achieve net zero carbon and methane emissions by 2050 . The ability to realize this commitment will require the ability to obtain significant regulatory approval from various regulatory bodies for the sitting and construction of such new facilities, such as wind and solar facilities . In February 2022, the company expanded this commitment to cover Scope 2 emissions and material categories of Scope 3 emissions .\n There are also potential impacts on Dominion Energy’s natural gas business from its net zero emissions commitment as well as federal or state GHG regulations . GHG requirements could result in increased demand for energy conservation and renewable products . The Companies cannot estimate the aggregate effect of future actions taken in furtherance of this commitment on their results of operations .\n The Companies expect that existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and/or new laws may be adopted including regulation of GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units . The Companies are also subject to federal water and waste regulations, including regulations concerning cooling water intake structures, coal combustion by-product handling and disposal practices, wastewater discharges from steam electric generating stations .\n The Companies historically produced and continue to produce coal ash, or CCRs, as a by-product of their coal-fired generation operations . The ash is stored and managed in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills located at 11 different facilities, eight of which are at Virginia Power . The Companies believe they may have inactive or closed units or areas that could be subject to the final rule at up to 19 different locations .\n The construction of the CVOW Commercial Project involves significant risks . A release of coal ash with a significant environmental impact could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs, and reputational damage . The Companies’ ability to complete the CVW Commercial Project within the currently proposed timeline is subject to various risks and uncertainties .\n Construction of the CVOW Commercial Project is also dependent on the ability of certain key suppliers and contractors to timely satisfy their obligations under contracts entered into or expected to be entered into . The final determination of such costs is outside the control of the project and may be impacted by events affecting the developers of such transmission lines . In May 2022, Virginia Power entered into forward purchase agreements with  Virginia Power .\n The Companies’ ability to recover unforeseen cost increases associated with construction of the CVOW Commercial Project is potentially limited . Adverse fluctuations in the price of fuel used for transportation and installation, would likely adversely affect the overall costs to construct the project . The Companies are subject to a cost sharing mechanism in which Virginia Power will be eligible to recover 50% of such incremental costs .\n Virginia Power completed the sale of a 50% noncontrolling interest to Stonepeak in October 2024 . Virginia Power and Stonepeak will each contribute 50% of the remaining capital necessary to fund construction of the CVOW Commercial Project provided the total project cost, excluding financing costs, is less than $11.3 billion . A decline in the Companies’ credit worthiness, an unfavorable market reputation of either the Companies or their industry or general market disruptions could adversely impact financing costs .\n Virginia Power and Stonepeak have the right to provide capital contributions for any total project costs, excluding financing costs, in excess of $13.7 billion . The inability of Stonepeak to satisfy its share of funding requirements in a timely manner could have a negative effect on the Companies . The construction of the CVOW Commercial Project involves the use of evolving turbine technology and takes place in a marine environment, which presents unique challenges .\n The Companies compete for projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including some that may have competitive advantages . Commencing construction on announced and future projects may require approvals from applicable state and federal agencies . Projects may not be able to be completed on time or in accordance with estimated costs as a result of weather conditions, need for new land and right of ways .\n The Companies are currently developing or constructing several electric generation projects, including subsequent license renewal projects at  Dominion Energy . The development, construction and commissioning of several large-scale infrastructure projects simultaneously involves significant execution risk . The total costs of the projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of the business of the Companies following completion may not meet expectations .\n The advancement of the Companies’ ventures is also affected by the interventions, litigation or other activities of stakeholder and advocacy groups, some of which oppose natural gas-related and energy infrastructure projects . The Companies are dependent on their contractors for the successful and timely completion of the projects . Failure to comply with regulatory approval conditions or an adverse ruling in any future litigation could adversely affect the Companies' ability to execute their business plan .\n The construction of such projects is expected to take several years and could be subject to delays, supply chain disruption, cost overruns, inflation, labor disputes or shortages . The Companies’ financial performance and condition can be affected by changes in the weather, including the effects of global climate change . An inability to obtain financing or otherwise provide liquidity for the projects on acceptable terms could negatively affect the Companies' financial condition .\n The Companies own assets deemed as critical infrastructure, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems . Cyber intrusions could severely impair the Companies’ operations, lead to the disclosure of confidential information, damage the reputation of the Companies and otherwise have an adverse effect on the companies’ business . There appears to be an increasing level of activity, sophistication and maturity of threat actors, in particular .\n A successful cyber attack through third-party or insider action could severely disrupt business operations . The breach of certain business systems could affect the Companies’ ability to correctly record, process and report financial information . A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage . The misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses .\n The Companies’ financial results can be adversely affected by various factors driving supply and demand for electricity and related services . Demand for Virginia Power’s services can be driven by changing populations within its utility service territories, significant new commercial or industrial customers or other changes in consumer habits . Technology advances may enhance energy efficiency in end-use devices, including lighting, furnaces and electric heat pumps and could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption .\n Virginia Power has an exclusive franchise to serve retail electric customers in Virginia . Virginia’s Retail Access Statutes allow certain electric generation customers exceptions to this franchise . The ability of the Companies to construct new facilities is dependent upon factors outside of their control, including obtaining regulatory approvals, environmental and other permits . The Companies’ operations are subject to operational hazards, equipment failures, supply chain disruptions and personnel issues .\n The risk of potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, fuel supply, accidents, accidents or work stoppages . Unplanned outages of the Companies’ facilities and extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems occur from time to time . The Companies' transmission facilities, pipelines and other facilities are interconnected with those of third parties .\n There are many risks associated with the Companies’ principal operations including nuclear accidents, fires, explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, pole strikes and pole strikes . Such incidents could result in loss of human life or injuries among employees, customers or the public in general . If the Companies are unable to perform their contractual obligations, penalties or liability for damages could result .\n Dominion Energy or Virginia Power may have a certain level of control or influence over these entities, but it may not have unilateral control over the day-to-day operations of these entities . The ability to comply with some or all of Dominion Energy’s voluntary commitments may be outside of its control . Disputes may arise amongst the owners of such partnership arrangements that may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses .\n Dominion Energy is dependent on the actions of third parties to meet the expanded commitment regarding Scope 2 emissions and Scope 3 emissions . If downstream customers or upstream suppliers do not sufficiently reduce their GHG emissions, Dominion Energy may not achieve its net zero emissions goal . Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials .\n The success of Dominion Energy’s contracted generation business depends upon favorable market conditions including the ability to sell power at prices sufficient to cover its operating costs . Dominion Energy operates in active wholesale markets that expose it to price volatility for electricity and nuclear fuel as well as the credit risk of counterparties . The failure of  Dominion Energy to maintain, renew or replace its existing long-term contracts on similar terms could result in a loss of revenue and/or decreased earnings and cash flows for Dominion Energy .\n Dominion Energy is exposed to nuclear fuel cost volatility for a portion of its nuclear fuel obtained through short-term contracts or on the spot market . Nuclear fuel prices can be volatile and the price that can be obtained for power produced may not change at the same rate as nuclear fuel costs . In the event that any of the contracted generation facilities experience a forced outage, Dominion Energy may not receive the level of revenue it anticipated .\n The Companies’ business strategy is dependent on their ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees . Failure to attract and retain key executive officers and an appropriately qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on the Companies' operations . The amount and scope of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses resulting from any such attack .\n The Companies have substantial ownership interests in and operate nuclear generating units . Nuclear facilities are subject to operational, environmental, health and financial risks . The Companies’ inability to attract and retain technical employees could adversely affect their business and future operating results . The companies maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure .\n The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities . The Companies have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at their plants . A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world, such as the nuclear events in Japan in 2011, could cause the NRC to adopt increased safety regulations .\n Companies rely on short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as significant sources of funding and liquidity for business plans . Dominion Energy’s ability to execute its business plan is further subject to the earnings and cash flows of its subsidiaries . Market disruptions could stem from general market disruption due to general credit market or political events .\n Market performance, interest rates and other changes may decrease the value of the Companies’ decommissioning trust funds and Dominion Energy’s benefit plan assets . The Companies have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts . These assets are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below expected return rates .\n The use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints . The Companies use derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, forwards, options and FTRs, to manage commodity, interest rate and/or foreign currency exchange rate risks . Non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user exception .\n Other intangible assets and long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable . The Companies are exposed to credit risks of their counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations . Counterparty performance may adversely affect the Companies’ financial results of operations .\n Public health crises and epidemics or pandemics could adversely affect the Companies’ business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and/or cash flows . Defaults or failure to perform by customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, financial institutions or other third parties may adversely affect financial results . The Companies have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integr. r operations .\n Consideration of cybersecurity risks is a key component of the Companies’ overall risk management and integrated into processes such as evaluation of potential new vendors or suppliers . The Companies are subject to mandatory cybersecurity regulatory requirements, interface regularly with a wide range of external organizations and participate in classified briefings to maintain an awareness of current cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities .\n The Companies have identified the risk that a hostile cyber intrusion could severely impair the Companies’ operations, lead to disclosure of confidential information . Cybersecurity incidents resulting in a material impact to their business strategy, results of operations or financial condition . Any cybersecurity incidents resulting from a cyber breach could have an adverse effect on business as disclosed under the Operational Risks header ."
