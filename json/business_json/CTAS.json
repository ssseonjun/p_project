Farmer when he left his family's industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric. In the early 1970's, Cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business. Over the years, Cintas developed additional products and services that complemented its core uniform business and broadened the scope of products and services available to its customers.\nBusiness Segments\nCintas’ reportable operating segments are the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services, as well as workplace water services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists of the Fire Protection Services operating segment and the Uniform Direct Sale operating segment, is included in All Other. \nThe following table sets forth Cintas' total revenue and the revenue derived from each reportable operating segment and the remaining operating segments included in All Other for the fiscal years ended May 31:\n(In thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nUniform Rental and Facility Services\n$\n7,976,073 \n$\n7,465,199 \n$\n6,897,130 \nFirst Aid and Safety Services\n1,218,090 \n1,067,334 \n951,496 \nAll Other\n1,146,018 \n1,064,082 \n967,143 \nTotal Revenue \n$\n10,340,181 \n$\n9,596,615 \n$\n8,815,769 \nAdditional information regarding each reportable operating segment and All Other is also included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" in \nNote 14\n entitled Operating Segment Information of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nCustomers\nWe provide our products and services to over one million businesses of all types, from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people. This diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of Cintas' total revenue. As a result, the loss of one account would not have a material financial impact on Cintas.\nCompetition\nThe primary markets served by each of the Cintas operating segments are local in nature and highly fragmented. Cintas competes with national, regional and local providers, large national retailers and small local retailers as well as companies with a significant online presence and the level of competition varies at each of Cintas' local operations. In addition, businesses may decide to perform certain services in-house instead of outsourcing these services. Product, design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our operating segments.\n3\nOperations and Distribution\nWithin the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, Cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches. Within the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, Cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives. At May 31, 2025, Cintas, in total, had approximately 12,100 local delivery routes, 478 operational facilities and 12 distribution centers. \nSourcing\nCintas is committed to sourcing responsibly. Cintas sources finished products from many outside suppliers. As mentioned on our website, www.cintas.com, each and every supplier must comply with a vendor code of conduct as a condition of doing business with Cintas. Cintas also conducts internal training to ensure that employee-partners who have direct responsibility for supply chain management are knowledgeable and aware of issues and concerns surrounding our supply chain. In addition to sourcing from third-party suppliers, Cintas operates five manufacturing facilities that provide for standard uniform needs. Cintas purchases fabric, used in the manufacturing of its products, from several suppliers. Cintas' ability to find qualified suppliers who meet its standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is subject to ongoing market risks. For a discussion of the risks associated with sourcing that may materially impact Cintas, please see \"",

    "item1b": "Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n13",
    "item1c": "Item 1C.  Cybersecurity\nWe have a cross-departmental approach to addressing cybersecurity risk, including input from employees and our Board of Directors (the Board). The Board, Audit Committee and senior management devote significant resources to cybersecurity and risk management processes to adapt to the changing cybersecurity landscape and respond to emerging threats in a timely and effective manner. \nOur cybersecurity risk management program is incorporated into our enterprise risk management program and leverages industry standards and best practices, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF 2.0), which organizes cybersecurity into six functions: govern, identify, protect, detect, respond and recover.\n We regularly assess the threat landscape and take a holistic view of cybersecurity risks, with a layered cybersecurity strategy based on prevention, detection and mitigation. We have a set of Company-wide policies and procedures concerning cybersecurity matters, which include numerous written information technology (IT) security policies, standards, procedures and guidelines as well as other policies that directly or indirectly relate to cybersecurity, such as policies related to encryption standards, antivirus protection, remote access, multifactor authentication, confidential information and the use of the internet, social media, email and wireless devices. These policies go through an internal review process and are approved by appropriate members of management.\n \nThe Company’s \nChief Information Security Officer\n (CISO) is responsible for developing and implementing and managing our cybersecurity security program and reporting on cybersecurity matters to the Audit Committee and the Board. \nOur CISO has over twenty-five years of IT and cybersecurity experience, has served over fifteen years in various cybersecurity management roles, and has various industry related degrees and certifications, including a master’s in information technology and the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) certifications.\n Our CISO is a part of, and is supported by, our IT security team, which includes other security leaders, security engineers, and security analysts. \nThe Board has ultimate oversight of cybersecurity risk, which it manages as part of our enterprise risk management program. That program is utilized in making decisions with respect to Company priorities, resource allocations and oversight structures. The Board is assisted by the Audit Committee, which regularly reviews our cybersecurity program with the CISO and other members of management and reports back to the Board. The Audit Committee receives reports from the CISO on, among other things, the Company’s cyber risks and threats, the status of projects to strengthen the Company’s information security systems, assessments of the Company’s security program and the emerging threat landscape. Cybersecurity reviews by the Audit Committee or the Board occur quarterly, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable.\nWe view cybersecurity as a shared responsibility. In an effort to detect and defend against cyber threats, the Company provides its employee-partners with various cybersecurity and data protection training programs and requires annual security awareness training participation. These programs cover timely and relevant topics, including social engineering, phishing, password protection, confidential data protection, asset use and mobile security, and these programs educate employee-partners on the importance of reporting all incidents promptly to the IT security team. We also require employee-partners in certain roles to complete additional role-based, specialized cybersecurity trainings.\nWe have continued to expand investments in IT security, including additional end-user training, using layered defenses, identifying and protecting critical assets, strengthening monitoring and alerting, and engaging experts. At the management level, our IT security team regularly monitors, alerts and meets to discuss threat levels, trends and remediation. The team also prepares a monthly cyber scorecard which covers cyber operational controls along with internal and external threats. Annual risk and cyber maturity assessments are conducted by independent third parties. Further, we conduct periodic external penetration tests and response testing to assess our processes and procedures against the evolving threat landscape. These tests and assessments are useful tools for maintaining a cybersecurity program that is designed to protect our investors, customers, employees, vendors and intellectual property.\n \nIn addition to assessing our own cybersecurity preparedness, we also consider and evaluate cybersecurity risks associated with use of third-party service providers. We seek to engage reliable, reputable service providers that maintain cybersecurity programs. Depending on the nature of the services provided, the sensitivity and quantity of information processed, and the identity of the service provider, our vendor management process may include reviewing the cybersecurity practices of such provider, conducting security assessments and conducting periodic reassessments during their engagement. \nOur IT security team conducts an annual review of third parties with a specific focus on any sensitive data shared with third parties\n. System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports are reviewed along with complementary user entity controls. If a third-party vendor is not able to provide a SOC 2 \n14\nreport, we take additional steps to assess their cybersecurity preparedness. Our assessment of risks associated with use of third-party providers is part of our overall cybersecurity risk management framework.\n \nWe maintain an Incident Response Plan that includes processes and procedures for reviewing and responding to cybersecurity incidents. We periodically test our readiness to respond to a cybersecurity incident through various scenario-based drills at technical and executive levels and incorporate external resources and advisors, as needed. \nThe Incident Response Plan includes processes for escalation to the CISO, the Executive Leadership Team, including the CEO and General Counsel, the Audit Committee and the Board. Our Incident Disclosure Committee has defined processes to determine whether a cybersecurity incident is material and may require disclosure in SEC filings.\nWe face a number of cybersecurity risks in connection with our business. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber intrusions, and we anticipate continuing to be subject to such attempts.\n \nAlthough such risks and attacks have not materially affected us, including our business strategy, consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition, to date, our security programs and measures may not prevent all intrusions, including malware and computer virus attacks\n.\n For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, see the information technology systems related risk factor in"
