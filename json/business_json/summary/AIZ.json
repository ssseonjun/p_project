Level 2 inputs utilize other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset . Level 3 inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing .\n The amounts presented below for short-term investments, other investments, cash equivalents, other assets, assets held in and liabilities related to separate accounts differ from the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets .

The financial balance sheets are shown below: The following table: The financial statements are presented at the bottom of the table .\n Three different valuation techniques can be used in determining fair value for financial assets and liabilities: the market, income or cost approaches .

The market approach valuation techniques use prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities .\n The Company’s investments and liabilities classified as Level 1 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of mutual funds and related obligations, money market funds and common stocks that are publicly listed and/or actively traded in an established market . The Company values Level 2 securities using various observable market inputs obtained from a pricing method . For all the classes of financial assets and liabilities included in the above hierarchy, the Company generally uses the market valuation technique .\n The fair value measurements and disclosures guidance defines observable market inputs as the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company . The extent of the use of each observable market input for a security depends on the type of security and the market conditions at the balance sheet date .\n The pricing service evaluates each security based on relevant market information including relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news .

The Company performs a periodic analysis to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of the financial assets’ fair values . This process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by investment and accounting professionals .\n In 2024 and 2023, as a result of third-party market observable transactions that were of the same issuer and determined to be similar, the Company marked certain of its equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative to fair value . These valuations utilize the market approach, or an option pricing model backsolve method, which can be used to determine the value of common shares for companies with complex capital structures .\n Guidance requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments that are not recognized or are not carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets . Guidance excludes certain financial instruments, including those related to insurance contracts and those accounted for under the equity method . For the financial instruments included within the following financial assets and financial liabilities, the carrying value in those assets equals or approximates fair value .\n The fair value of commercial mortgage loans on real estate utilizes a third-party matrix pricing model . Other investments include low income housing tax credits, business debentures, and credit tenant loans which are recorded at cost or amortized cost, as well as policy loans . The carrying value of dealer loans approximates fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments .\n The fair value of the Company’s policy reserves for investment-type contracts (those without significant mortality or morbidity risk) are reflected in the tables above .

The Company plans to indefinitely reinvest the earnings in other jurisdictions .\n Net operating loss carryforwards by jurisdiction are as follows as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2023 . $19.8% expires between 2025 and 2044, $.9% has an unlimited carryforward . $9,967.2/2022: Deferred Acquisition Costs $9,992.8/2023: depreciation expense for the years ended December 31 .\n During first quarter 2025, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Miami, Florida property to a buyer for a purchase price of $126.0 million . The Company expects to record a gain above the carrying value, less estimated costs to sell . There can be no assurance that the transaction will be consummated .\n A Dividend Discount Method (“DDM”) was used to value each of the reporting units based upon the present value of expected cash flows available for distribution over future periods . Cash flows were estimated for a discrete projection period based on detailed assumptions, and a terminal value was calculated to reflect the value attributable to cash flows beyond the discrete period .\n In the second quarter of 2022, $7.8 million of goodwill was allocated to the sharing economy and small commercial businesses which are included within non-core operations in Corporate and Other . The fair value of the  sharing economy was determined using a discounted cash flow method . The Company concluded that the estimated fair values of the Connected Living, Global Automotive and Global Housing reporting units exceeded their respective book values .\n The fair value calculated in the fourth quarter of 2022 was lower than the carrying value of the run-off businesses, resulting in the pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge of the entire goodwill of $7.8 million .
