Meier\n \n \nAttorney-in-Fact\n71\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Assurant, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Assurant, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nF-1\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Claims and Benefits Payable Reserves for Global Lifestyle and Global Housing Short Duration Insurance Contracts\nAs described in Notes 2 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company maintains claims and benefits payable reserves for short duration insurance contracts. Reserves are established using generally accepted actuarial methods and reflect judgments about expected future claim payments. The reserve liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s total liability for claims and benefits payable was $2.91 billion, which included $2.61 billion of liabilities for short duration contracts within the Global Lifestyle and Global Housing reporting segments. Claims and benefits payable reserves include case reserves for known claims which are unpaid as of the balance sheet date; incurred but not reported reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported as of the balance sheet date; and loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Factors used in the calculation of the reserves include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions. As described by management, the best estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense is generally selected from a blend of different actuarial methods that are applied consistently each period, considering significant assumptions including projected loss development factors and expected loss ratios.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of claims and benefits payable reserves for short duration insurance contracts is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining their estimates; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the actuarial methods and projected loss development factors and expected loss ratio assumptions; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of claims and benefits payable reserves for short duration insurance contracts, including controls over the selection of actuarial methods, completeness and accuracy of claims data and the development of the significant assumptions. On a test basis, these procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of historical claims data provided by management and the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in either (i) testing management’s process for determining the estimates by evaluating the appropriateness of management’s actuarial methods and the reasonableness of projected loss development factors and expected loss ratio assumptions; or (ii) developing an actuarially determined independent estimate utilizing actual historical data and loss development patterns, as well as industry data and other benchmarks, and comparing this independent estimate to management’s actuarially determined reserves.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n \nNew

\nNature of Operations \nAssurant, Inc. (the “Company”) is a leading global protection company that safeguards and services major consumer purchases through data-driven, technology solutions. The Company partners with the world’s foremost brands to deliver exceptional customer experiences that meet device, car and home needs. The Company operates in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific through \ntwo\n operating segments: Global Lifestyle and Global Housing. Through its Global Lifestyle segment, the Company provides mobile device solutions, extended service contracts and related services for consumer electronics and appliances, and credit and other insurance products (referred to as “Connected Living”); and vehicle protection services, commercial equipment services and other related services (referred to as “Global Automotive”). Through its Global Housing segment, the Company provides lender-placed homeowners, manufactured housing and flood insurance, as well as voluntary manufactured housing, condominium and homeowners insurance (referred to as “Homeowners”); and renters insurance and other products (referred to as “Renters and Other”).\nThe Company’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “AIZ.”\n \nF-8\n2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Amounts are presented in United States of America (“U.S.”) Dollars and all amounts are in millions, except for number of shares, per share amounts and number of securities. Certain prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the realignment of the composition of its reportable segments to correspond with changes to its operating structure effective January 1, 2023.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries, generally through a greater than 50% ownership of voting rights and voting interests. Equity investments in entities that the Company does not consolidate, but where the Company has significant influence or where the Company has more than a minor influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method. All material inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. In order to facilitate the Company’s closing process, financial information from certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates is reported on a one to three-month lag.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. The items affected by the use of estimates include but are not limited to, investments, reinsurance recoverables, premium and accounts receivables, deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances, goodwill, intangible assets, future policy benefits and expenses, unearned premiums, claims and benefits payable, deferred gain on disposal of businesses, pension and post-retirement liabilities and commitments and contingencies. The estimates are sensitive to market conditions, investment yields, mortality, morbidity, commissions and other acquisition expenses, policyholder behavior and other factors. Actual results could differ from the estimates recorded. The Company believes all amounts reported are reasonable and adequate.\nFair Value\nThe Company uses an exit price for its fair value measurements. An exit price is defined as the amount received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In measuring fair value, the Company gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.\n See Note 9 for additional information.\nForeign Currency\nFor foreign affiliates where the local currency is the functional currency, unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses net of deferred income taxes have been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). For Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico, deferred taxes have not been provided for unrealized currency translation gains and losses since the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings in these other jurisdictions. Transaction gains and losses on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations during the period in which they occur.\nManagement generally identifies highly inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rates over a three-year period exceeds 100%, in addition to considering other qualitative and quantitative factors. Beginning July 1, 2018, as a result of the classification of Argentina’s economy as highly inflationary, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiaries was changed from the local currency to U.S. Dollars. The subsidiaries’ non-U.S. Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities have been subject to remeasurement since July 1, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the remeasurement resulted in $\n3.0\n million, $\n29.4\n million and $\n16.7\n million, respectively, of net pre-tax losses which the Company classified within underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Based on the relative size of the subsidiaries’ operations and net assets subject to remeasurement, the Company does not anticipate the ongoing remeasurement to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company may enter into agreements with other entities that are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support or in which the equity investors, as a group, do not have the characteristic of a controlling financial interest are referred to as VIEs. A VIE is consolidated by the variable interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest (the “primary beneficiary”) as a result of having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be \nF-9\nsignificant to the VIE. The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of an entity subject to consolidation based on a qualitative assessment of the VIE’s capital structure, contractual terms, the nature of the VIE’s operations and purpose and the Company’s relative exposure to the related risks of the VIE on the date it becomes initially involved in the VIE. The Company only holds non-consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \nInvestments\nFixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale as defined in the investments guidance and are reported at fair value. If the fair value is higher than the amortized cost for fixed maturity securities, the excess is an unrealized gain; and, if lower than amortized cost, the difference is an unrealized loss. Net unrealized gains and losses on securities classified as available-for-sale, less deferred income taxes, are included in AOCI.\n  Presentation of credit-related impairments is shown as an allowance, recognizing credit impairments upon purchase of securities as applicable, and requiring reversals of previously recognized credit-related impairments when applicable. \nFor available for sale fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position for which the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes to the credit rating of the security by a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, industry or geographic area, among other factors. If this assessment indicates a potential credit loss may exist, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are compared to the security’s amortized cost basis. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit-related impairment exists, and a charge to income and an associated allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit-related impairment. Any impairment not related to credit losses is recorded through other comprehensive income. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Upon recognizing a credit-related impairment, the cost basis of the security is not adjusted. \nSubsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for, or reversal of, credit loss expense. For fixed maturities where the Company records a credit loss, a determination is made as to the cause of the impairment and whether the Company expects a recovery in the value. Write-offs are charged against the allowance when management concludes the financial asset is uncollectible. For fixed maturities where the Company expects a recovery in value, the effective yield method is utilized, and the investment is amortized to par. \nFor available for sale fixed maturity securities that the Company intends to sell, or for which it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire impairment loss, or difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security, is recognized in net realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities. The new cost basis of the security is the previous amortized cost basis less the impairment recognized and is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value.  \nThe Company reports receivables for accrued investment income separately from fixed maturities available for sale and elected not to measure allowances for credit losses for accrued investment income as uncollectible balances are written off in a timely manner.              \nEquity securities that have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The Company has certain equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and the Company has elected the measurement alternative to carry such investments at cost, less impairment and to mark to fair value when observable prices in identical or similar investments from the same issuer occur. \nEquity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative are impaired if a qualitative assessment based upon several indicators such as earnings performance, offers to sell or purchase, ability to continue as a going concern and macroeconomic factors indicates the equity investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. If a qualitative assessment indicates impairment, a quantitative analysis, which uses probability weighted potential outcomes, is performed to determine the amount of the impairment to be recognized that result in a fair value measurement. Equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative are included within other investments in the consolidated balance sheets.\nCommercial mortgage loans on real estate are reported at unpaid principal balances, adjusted for amortization of premium or discount, less any allowance for credit losses. The allowance for the Company’s commercial mortgage loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, utilizing a probability-of-default and loss given default methodologies, which incorporate various probability weighted economic scenarios. The probability of default is estimated using macroeconomic factors as well as individual loan characteristics, including loan-to-value (“LTV”) and debt service coverage ratios (“DSC”), loan term, collateral type, geography and underlying credit. The loss given default is \nF-10\ndriven primarily by the type and value of underlying collateral, and to a lesser extent by expected liquidation costs and time to recovery. Each loan is analyzed individually based on loan-specific data elements to estimate the expected loss and then aggregated. \nThe Company places loans on nonaccrual status after \n90\n days of delinquent payments (unless the loans are secured and in the process of collection). A loan may be placed on nonaccrual status before this time if information is available that suggests collection is unlikely. The Company charges off loan and accrued interest balances that are deemed uncollectible. Charge offs are recorded to net income in the period deemed uncollectible. Refer to Note 4 for further details on the allowance for credit losses on commercial mortgage loans. \nShort-term investments include securities and other investments with durations of one year or less, but greater than three months, between the date of purchase and maturity. These amounts are reported at cost or amortized cost, which approximates fair value. \nOther investments consist primarily of investments in joint ventures, partnerships, equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, invested assets associated with a modified coinsurance arrangement, invested assets associated with the Assurant Investment Plan (the “AIP”), the American Security Insurance Company Investment Plan (the “ASIC”) and the Assurant Deferred Compensation Plan (the “ADC”), as well as policy loans. The joint ventures and partnerships are valued according to the equity method of accounting. In applying the equity method, the Company uses financial information provided by the investee, generally on a three-month lag. The invested assets related to the modified coinsurance arrangement, the AIP, the ASIC and the ADC are classified as trading securities. Policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances, which do not exceed the cash surrender value of the underlying policies. \nRealized gains and losses on sales of investments are recognized on the specific identification basis.\nInvestment income is recorded as earned and reported net of investment expenses. The Company uses the interest method to recognize interest income on its commercial mortgage loans.\nThe Company anticipates prepayments of principal in the calculation of the effective yield for mortgage-backed securities and structured securities. The retrospective method is used to adjust the effective yield for the majority of the Company’s mortgage-backed and structured securities. For credit-sensitive or credit impaired structured securities, the effective yield is recalculated on a prospective basis, primarily our commercial mortgage-backed, residential mortgage-backed and asset backed securities.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid securities and other investments with durations of three months or less between the date of purchase and maturity to be cash equivalents. These amounts are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash balances are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine if negative cash balances exist. If negative cash balances exist, the cash accounts are netted with other positive cash accounts of the same bank provided the right of offset exists between the accounts. If the right of offset does not exist, the negative cash balances are reclassified to accounts payable and other liabilities.\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents, of $\n122.4\n million and $\n43.6\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, principally related to cash deposits involving insurance programs with restrictions as to withdrawal and use, are classified within cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.\nReinsurance\nFor both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met for reinsurance accounting to apply. If risk transfer requirements are not met, the contract is accounted for as a deposit, resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of both underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. Similar risk transfer criteria are used to determine whether directly written insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or as a deposit. \nReinsurance recoverables include amounts related to paid benefits and estimated amounts related to unpaid policy and contract claims, future policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits. The cost of reinsurance is recognized as a reduction to premiums earned over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported in the consolidated balance sheets. The cost of reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is recognized over the life of the underlying reinsured policies. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the Company’s primary liability to insureds, thus a credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligation assumed in the reinsurance agreements. To mitigate this exposure to reinsurer insolvencies, the Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers \nF-11\nand typically holds collateral (in the form of funds withheld, trusts and letters of credit) as security under the reinsurance agreements.\nThe Company accounts for credit losses using the expected credit loss model for reinsurance recoverables. The Company uses a probability of default and loss given default methodology in estimating the allowance, whereby the credit ratings of reinsurers are used in determining the probability of default. The allowance is established for reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid future policy benefits and claims and benefits. Prior to applying default factors, the net exposure to credit risk is reduced for any collateral for which the right of offset exists, such as funds withheld, assets held in trust and letters of credit, which are part of the reinsurance arrangements, with adjustments to include consideration of credit exposure on the collateral. The methodology used by the Company incorporates historical default factors for each reinsurer based on their credit rating using comparably rated bonds as published by a major ratings service. The allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing and other relevant factors. \nFunds held under reinsurance represent amounts contractually held from assuming companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements, primarily from collateral considerations.\nReinsurance premiums assumed are calculated based upon payments received from ceding companies together with accrual estimates, which are based on both payments received and in force policy information received from ceding companies. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined.\nPremiums and Accounts Receivable\nPremiums and accounts receivable includes insurance premiums receivable from policyholders and amounts due from sponsors or agents. The Company accounts for credit losses using the expected credit loss model for premiums and accounts receivable. For receivables due directly from the insured or consumer, the allowance for credit losses is generally calculated by aging the receivable balances and applying default factors based on the Company’s historical collection data. For receivables due from product sponsors or agents, receivable balances are generally segregated by the sponsor or agent and an appropriate default factor is determined based on creditworthiness, billing terms and aging of balances. The financial exposure of a credit loss is determined net of offsets (such as related unearned premium reserves for consumer receivables and receivables net of commissions payable, profit share liabilities and captive reinsurance for balances due from sponsors/agents) prior to applying a default factor.\n \nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nOnly direct and incremental costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts are deferred to the extent that such costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums. Acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions and premium taxes. Certain direct response advertising expenses are deferred when the primary purpose of the advertising is to elicit sales to customers who can be shown to have specifically responded to the advertising and the direct response advertising results in probable future benefits.\nAll other acquisition-related costs, including those related to general advertising and solicitation, market research, agent training, product development, unsuccessful sales and underwriting efforts, as well as all indirect costs, are expensed as incurred. \nPremium deficiency testing is performed annually and generally reviewed quarterly. Such testing involves the use of assumptions including the anticipation of investment income to determine if anticipated future policy premiums are adequate to recover all DAC and related claims, benefits and expenses. To the extent a premium deficiency exists, it is recognized immediately by a charge to the consolidated statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in DAC. If the premium deficiency is greater than unamortized DAC, a loss (and related liability) is recorded for the excess deficiency. \nShort Duration Contracts\nAcquisition costs relating to extended service contracts, vehicle service contracts, mobile device protection, credit insurance, lender-placed homeowners insurance and flood, multifamily housing and manufactured housing insurance are amortized over the term of the contracts in relation to premiums earned. These acquisition costs consist primarily of advance commissions paid to agents.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives with a maximum of \n39.5\n years for buildings, a maximum of \nseven years\n for furniture and a maximum of \nfive years\n for equipment. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset.\nProperty and equipment also include capitalized software costs, comprised of purchased software as well as certain internal and external costs incurred during the application development stage that directly relate to obtaining, developing or \nF-12\nupgrading internal use software. Such costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, not to exceed \n15\n years. Property and equipment are assessed for impairment when impairment indicators exist.\nGoodwill\n \nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and is not amortized, but rather is tested at least annually for impairment. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators include: a significant adverse change in legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a significant decline in the Company’s expected future cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. The evaluation of such factors requires considerable management judgment. \nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is either at the operating segment or one level below, if that component is a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews such information. Components within an operating segment can be aggregated into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics.\nAt the time of the annual goodwill test, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company is required to perform an additional quantitative step if it determines qualitatively that it is more likely than not (likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Otherwise, no further testing is required. \nIf the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than the carrying value, or otherwise elects to perform the quantitative testing, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its net book value. If the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its net book value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the reporting unit’s net book value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.\n Refer to Note 14 for further details on goodwill impairment testing for 2024. \nOther Intangible Assets \nIntangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the intangible asset is consumed, which may be other than straight-line. Estimated useful lives of finite intangible assets are required to be reassessed on at least an annual basis. For intangible assets with finite lives, impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the other intangible asset. Generally, other intangible assets with finite lives are only tested for impairment if there are indicators of impairment (“triggers”) identified. Triggers include a significant adverse change in the extent, manner or length of time in which the intangible asset is being used or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the other intangible asset. \nVOBA represents the value of expected future profits in unearned premium for insurance contracts acquired in an acquisition. For vehicle service contracts and extended service contracts, such as those purchased in connection with the TWG acquisition, the amount is determined using estimates, for premium earnings patterns, paid loss development patterns, expense loads and discount rates applied to cash flows that include a provision for credit risk. The amount determined represents the purchase price paid to the seller for producing the business. For vehicle service contracts and extended service contracts, VOBA is amortized consistent with the premium earning patterns of the underlying in-force contracts. VOBA is tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for recoverability. \nAmortization expense and impairment charges for other intangible assets are included in underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nOther Assets \nOther assets include prepaid items, income tax receivable, deferred income tax assets, right-of-use assets, dealer loans and inventory associated with the Company’s mobile protection business.\n  \nReserves \nReserves are established using generally accepted actuarial methods and reflect judgments about expected future premium and claim payments. Factors used in their calculation include experience derived from historical claim payments, expected future premiums and actuarial assumptions. Calculations incorporate assumptions about the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported, reporting lags, expenses, inflation rates, future investment earnings, internal claims processing costs and other relevant factors. The estimation of reserves includes an element of uncertainty given that management is using historical information and methods to project future events and reserve outcomes. \nF-13\nThe recorded reserves represent the Company’s best estimate at a point in time of the ultimate costs of settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims based upon actuarial assumptions and projections using facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation. The adequacy of reserves may be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by both external and internal events, including: changes in the economic cycle, inflation, changes in repair costs, natural or human-made catastrophes, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures. \nMany of these items are not directly quantifiable and not all future events can be anticipated when reserves are established. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently complex process involving significant judgment and estimates, there can be no certainty that future settlement amounts for claims incurred through the financial reporting date will not vary from reported claims reserves. Future loss development could require reserves to be increased or decreased, which could have a material effect on the Company’s earnings in the periods in which such increases or decreases are made. However, based on information currently available, the Company believes its reserve estimates are adequate.\n \nThe following table provides reserve information as of December 31, 2024 and 2023: \n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n \n \nClaims and Benefits\nPayable\n \n \nClaims and Benefits\nPayable\n \nFuture\nPolicy\nBenefits and\nExpenses\nUnearned\nPremiums\nCase\nReserves\nIncurred\nBut Not\nReported\nReserves\nFuture\nPolicy\nBenefits and\nExpenses\nUnearned\nPremiums\nCase\nReserves\nIncurred\nBut Not\nReported\nReserves\nLong Duration Contracts:\nNon-core operations (1)\n$\n52.5\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1.2\n \n$\n0.9\n \n$\n57.7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1.2\n \n$\n1.0\n \nAll other disposed or runoff businesses (2)\n484.2\n \n1.7\n \n—\n \n0.1\n \n429.5\n \n1.9\n \n—\n \n0.1\n \nShort Duration Contracts:\nGlobal Lifestyle\n—\n \n18,368.4\n \n149.0\n \n572.7\n \n—\n \n18,536.6\n \n132.5\n \n472.7\n \nGlobal Housing\n—\n \n1,813.6\n \n828.7\n \n1,056.6\n \n—\n \n1,554.9\n \n138.0\n \n851.9\n \nNon-core operations (1)\n—\n \n5.8\n \n35.5\n \n85.9\n \n—\n \n13.9\n \n44.0\n \n151.8\n \nAll other disposed or runoff businesses (2)\n—\n \n21.9\n \n81.7\n \n101.9\n \n—\n \n3.1\n \n88.5\n \n107.5\n \nTotal\n$\n536.7\n \n$\n20,211.4\n \n$\n1,096.1\n \n$\n1,818.1\n \n$\n487.2\n \n$\n20,110.4\n \n$\n404.2\n \n$\n1,585.0\n \n(1)\nIncludes certain businesses which the Company expects to fully exit, including the long-tail commercial liability businesses (sharing economy and small commercial businesses), certain legacy long-duration insurance policies and the Company’s operations in mainland China (collectively referred to as “non-core operations”), recorded in the Corporate and Other segment. During 2024, the mainland China operations were sold and will no longer be included in non-core operations going forward.\n(2)\nPrimarily includes businesses sold through reinsurance reported in the Corporate and Other and Global Lifestyle segments.\n \nLong Duration Contracts\n \nThe Company’s long duration contracts, after the sale of the disposed Global Preneed business and John Alden Life Insurance Company, primarily comprises run-off blocks of long-term care and universal life policies.\nThe Company adopted the targeted improvements accounting guidance for long-duration insurance contracts as of January 1, 2023, using a modified retrospective method on liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses to January 1, 2021 for long-term care insurance contracts that have been fully reinsured. The Company also elected to not apply the amended accounting guidance to long-duration contracts of legal entities sold and derecognized before the January 1, 2023 effective date as the Company has no significant continuing involvement with them.\nUnder the transition guidance, the long-term care insurance contracts are grouped into cohorts based on the contract’s issue year. Premiums are recognized when due as net earned premiums in the consolidated statement of operations. A future policy benefits and expenses reserve is recorded as the present value of estimated future policy benefits and expenses less the present value of estimated future net premiums. The net premium ratio (“NPR”) approach is used to recognize a liability when expected insurance benefits are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to premium revenue. Policy expense assumptions are locked in as of December 31, 2020 as the long-term care insurance products are in run-off as of the transition date. Actual premiums and benefits are recognized on a quarterly basis in the consolidated statement of operations allocated in proportion to prior period cash flow projections at the cohort level. The updated cash flows used in the calculation are \nF-14\ndiscounted using the discount rate used in the last premium deficiency test update prior to December 31, 2020 (the “original discount rate”) and presented as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The revised NPR is used to measure benefit expense based on the recognized premium revenue in the period. The difference between the updated future policy benefits and expenses reserve opening period and previous ending period due to updating the NPR is presented as a remeasurement gain or loss (e.g., a cumulative catch-up adjustment) in policyholder benefits in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nA remeasurement of the ending reporting period future policy benefits and expenses reserve is calculated using the current upper medium grade fixed-income corporate bond instrument yield as of the consolidated balance sheet ending period (the “current discount rate”). The current discount rate used is an externally published US corporate A index weighted average spot rate that is updated quarterly and effectively matches the duration of the expected cash flow streams of the long-term care reserves. The difference between the ending period future policy benefits and expenses reserve measured using the original discount rate and the future policy benefits and expenses reserve measured using the current discount rate is recorded in AOCI in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nThe long-term care insurance contracts are fully reinsured and there is no impact to consolidated stockholders’ equity or net income as the reserves are fully reinsured. See Note 16 for additional information. \nFuture policy benefits and expense reserves for universal life insurance policies consist of policy account balances before applicable surrender charges that are being recognized in income over the terms of the policies. Policy benefits charged to expense during the period include amounts paid in excess of policy account balances and interest credited to policy account balances.\n \nShort Duration Contracts \nThe Company’s short duration contracts include products and services in the Global Lifestyle and Global Housing segments, and Assurant Employee Benefits policies fully covered by reinsurance and certain medical policies no longer offered. For Global Lifestyle, the main product lines include extended service contracts, vehicle services contracts, mobile device protection and credit insurance. The main product lines for Global Housing include lender-placed homeowners and flood, Multifamily Housing and manufactured housing. For short duration contracts, claims and benefits payable reserves are recorded when insured events occur. The liability is based on the expected ultimate cost of settling the claims. The claims and benefits payable reserves include (1) case reserves for known but unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date; (2) incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to the Company as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. Factors used in the calculation include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions including loss development factors and expected loss ratios. \nThe Company has exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general liability claims arising from its participation in various reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1985. This exposure arose from a short duration contract that the Company discontinued writing many years ago. The Company carries case reserves for these liabilities as recommended by the various pool managers and IBNR reserves. Estimation of these liabilities is subject to greater than normal variation and uncertainty due to the general lack of sufficiently detailed data, reporting delays and absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for determining the exposures. There are significant unresolved industry legal issues, including such items as whether coverage exists and what constitutes an occurrence. In addition, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of losses to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain. \nChanges in the estimated liabilities are recorded as a charge or credit to policyholder benefits as estimates are updated. Fees paid by the National Flood Insurance Program for processing and adjudication services are reported as a reduction of underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses.\n \nDebt \nThe Company reports debt net of acquisition costs, unamortized discount or premium and repurchases. Interest expense related to debt is expensed as incurred.\n See Note 18 for additional information. \nContingencies \nA loss contingency is recorded if reasonably estimable and probable. The Company establishes reserves for these contingencies at the best estimate, or if no one estimated amount within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the estimated range. Contingencies affecting the Company primarily relate to legal and regulatory matters, which are inherently difficult to evaluate and are subject to significant changes.\n \nF-15\nOther Liabilities\nWith respect to the deductible portion of a high deductible claim, the Company manages and pays the entire claim on behalf of the insured and is reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. These recoverable amounts represent a credit exposure. The Company accounts for credit losses using the expected credit loss model for high deductible recoverables. The Company uses a probability of default and loss given default methodology in estimating the allowance, whereby the credit ratings of insureds are used in determining the probability of default. The allowance is established for unsecured portion of the high deductible recoverables on unpaid future policy benefits. The methodology used by the Company incorporates historical default factors for each insured based on their credit rating using comparably rated bonds as published by a major ratings service. The allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in insured credit standing and other relevant factors.\nRetirement of Treasury Stock \nThe Company accounts for the retirement of repurchased shares using the par value method. This method of accounting allocates the cost of repurchased and retired shares between paid-in capital and retained earnings by comparing the price of shares repurchased to the original issue proceeds of those shares. When the repurchase price of the shares is greater than the original issue proceeds, the excess is charged to retained earnings. The Company uses an average cost method to determine the cost of the repurchased shares to be retired.\n \nPremiums \nShort Duration Contracts \nThe Company’s short duration contracts revenue is recognized over the contract term in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided.\nPremiums revenue from vehicle and extended service contracts are earned over the term of the contract, which are typically between \nthree\n and \nfive years\n, based on loss emergence experience. Mobile device protection and credit insurance are monthly policies and premium is earned on a monthly basis.\nPremiums for lender-placed homeowners, manufactured housing and flood insurance, and renters insurance are generally earned on a pro-rata basis over the term of the policies, which are typically over twelve months. \nReinsurance reinstatement premiums are recognized in the same period as the loss event that gave rise to the reinstatement premium and are netted against net earned premiums in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLong Duration Contracts \nPremiums for the Company’s run-off blocks of long-term care insurance contracts are recognized as revenue when due from the policyholder. For universal life insurance, revenues consist of charges assessed against policy balances. These premiums are ceded.\n \nFees and Other Income \nThe Company derives fees and other income from providing administrative services, mobile-related services and mortgage property risk management services. These fees are recognized as the services are performed. \nThe Company reports revenues related to long duration and short duration insurance contracts as premiums, including insurance contracts written by non-insurance affiliates, such as certain extended service contracts, consistent with the Company’s principal business of insurance. Components of consideration paid by the insured are generally not separated as fees and other income. However, when a component of the consideration paid by an insured both does not involve fulfilling the insurance obligation (in that it does not involve acquisition, claims or other administrative aspects of the insurance contract) and the related service could have been written as a separate contract, it is reported in fees and other income.\nDealer obligor service contracts are sales in which an unaffiliated retailer/dealer is the obligor and the Company provides administrative services only. For these contract sales, the Company recognizes administrative fee revenue on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the service contract which correspond to the period in which the services are performed. \nThe unexpired portion of fee revenues are deferred and amortized over the term of the contracts. These unexpired amounts are reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n \nUnderwriting, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n \nUnderwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, salaries and personnel benefits and other general operating expenses and are expensed as incurred.\n \nF-16\nIncome Taxes\nCurrent federal income taxes are recognized based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year. Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the Company expects the temporary differences to reverse. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized. The impact of changes in tax rates on all deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be reflected within income on the enactment date, regardless of the financial statement component where the deferred tax originated. \nThe Company classifies net interest expense related to tax matters and any applicable penalties as a component of income tax expense.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts that can be converted into common stock were exercised as of the end of the period, if dilutive. Restricted stock and restricted stock units that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are included in calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share under the two-class method.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income, net unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation, net unrealized gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale, and expenses for pension and post-retirement plans, less deferred income taxes.\n \n \nLeases \nThe Company records expenses for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company recognizes assets and liabilities associated with leases on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company and its subsidiaries lease office space and equipment under operating lease arrangements for which the Company is the lessee. Right-of-use asset, lease liabilities and deferred rent liability related to operating leases with terms in excess of 12 months are recognized when the Company is the lessee.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nChanges to GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in the form of Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs.  \nF-17\nAdopted Accounting Pronouncements\n \nThe table below describes the impacts of the ASUs adopted by the Company, effective December 31, 2024: \nStandard\nSummary of the Standard\nEffective date\nMethod of Adoption\nImpact of the Standard on the Company’s Financial Statements\nASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nThe guidance improves reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. Key disclosure updates include:\n• On an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss.\n• On an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. The other segment items category is the          difference between segment revenue less the significant expenses disclosed and each reported measure of segment profit or loss.\n• All current annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Topic 280, Segment Reporting on an interim basis.\n• Clarify that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public entity may report one or more of those additional measures of segment profit. However, at least one of the reported segment’s profit or loss measures (or the single reported measure, if only one is disclosed) should be the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the public entity’s consolidated financial statements.\n• Require the disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.\n• Require that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in the ASU and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280.\nThe guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements, unless it is impracticable.\nDecember 31, 2024\nand for interim\nperiods thereafter\nThe Company adopted the standard as of December 31, 2024 and the amended segment information disclosures is presented in Note 5.\nFuture Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements\n \nASUs issued but not yet adopted as of December 31, 2024, that are currently being assessed and may or may not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosures are included below. ASUs not listed below were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nF-18\nStandard\nSummary of the Standard\nEffective date\nMethod of Adoption\nImpact of the Standard on the Company’s Financial Statements\nASU 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nThe guidance improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures.\nJanuary 1, 2025 (with early adoption permitted)\nThe Company is assessing the adoption of this standard as of January 1, 2025. The amended guidance is expected to have no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and insignificant impact on the Company’s income tax disclosures.\nASU 2024-03 Income\nStatement—Reporting\nComprehensive Income— Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nThe guidance improves disclosures of specified information about certain costs and expenses at each interim and annual reporting periods. The new disclosure requirements include:\n•\nDisclose the amounts of (a) purchases of inventory; (b) employee compensation; (c) depreciation; (d) intangible asset amortization; and (e) depreciation, depletion, and amortization recognized as part of oil- and gas-producing activities (or other amounts of depletion expense) included in each relevant expense caption.\n•\nInclude certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed under current GAAP in the same disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements.\n•\nDisclose a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively.\n•\nDisclose the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses.\nDecember 31, 2027 and for interim periods thereafter\nThe Company is assessing the impact of adopting this standard as of December 31, 2027. The amended guidance is expected to have no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and to expand the annual and interim disclosures of disaggregation of relevant expense captions in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.\n3. \nAcquisition \nALI\nOn November 1, 2022, the Company acquired American Lease Insurance Agency Corporation (“ALI”), a managing general agency headquartered in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and its captive subsidiary, The Equipment Lease Reinsurance Company Ltd, licensed in Turks and Caicos, for total consideration of $\n60.0\n million in cash. ALI is a provider of property and liability insurance products for commercial equipment and vehicles that are leased or financed. The Company recorded $\n37.4\n million of goodwill, $\n19.2\n million of other intangible assets, which are primarily dealer relationships amortizable over \n10\n years, and $\n1.9\n million of VOBA, which is amortizable over \n5\n years based on the earnings pattern.\n4. \nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe total allowance for credit losses for the financial assets was $\n20.7\n million and $\n26.8\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe following table presents the net increases (decreases) to the allowance for credit losses as classified in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated: \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nCommercial mortgage loans on real estate\n$\n2.5\n \n$\n2.2\n \nNet realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities\n2.5\n \n2.2\n \nUnderwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses\n(\n5.6\n)\n0.9\n \nNet increase (decrease) in allowance for credit losses\n$\n(\n3.1\n)\n$\n3.1\n \nReinsurance Recoverables\nAs part of the Company’s overall risk and capacity management strategy, reinsurance is used to mitigate certain risks underwritten by various business segments. The Company is exposed to the credit risk of reinsurers, as the Company remains liable to insureds regardless of whether related reinsurance recoverables are collected. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, reinsurance recoverables totaled $\n7.58\n billion and $\n6.65\n billion, respectively, the majority of which are protected from \nF-19\ncredit risk by various types of collateral or other risk mitigation mechanisms, such as trusts, letters of credit or by withholding the assets in a modified coinsurance or funds withheld arrangement.  \nThe Company utilizes external credit ratings published by S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global Inc., at the balance sheet date when determining the allowance. Where rates are not available, the Company assigns default credit ratings based on if the reinsurer is authorized or unauthorized. Of the total recoverables subject to the allowance, \n84\n% were rated A- or better, \n5\n% were rated B- and \n11\n% were not rated based on the Company’s analysis and assigned ratings for the year ended December 31, 2024; and \n82\n% were rated A- or better, \n1\n% were rated BBB or BB, and \n17\n% were not rated based on the Company’s analysis and assigned ratings for the year ended December 31, 2023.  \nThe following table presents the changes in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment for reinsurance recoverables for the periods indicated: \nGlobal Lifestyle\nGlobal Housing\nCorporate \nand Other\nTotal\nBalance, December 31, 2022\n$\n3.6\n \n$\n1.1\n \n$\n0.7\n \n$\n5.4\n \nCurrent period change for credit losses\n(\n0.3\n)\n—\n \n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n0.6\n)\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n3.3\n \n1.1\n \n0.4\n \n4.8\n \nCurrent period change for credit losses\n(\n0.1\n)\n0.2\n \n0.1\n \n0.2\n \nBalance, December 31, 2024\n$\n3.2\n \n$\n1.3\n \n$\n0.5\n \n$\n5.0\n \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the current period change for credit losses was $\n0.2\n million and  $(\n0.6\n) million, respectively. When determining the allowance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not increase default probabilities by reinsurer since there had been no credit rating downgrades or major negative credit indications of the Company’s reinsurers that has impacted rating. The allowance may be increased and income reduced in future periods if there are future ratings downgrades or other measurable information supporting an increase in reinsurer default probabilities, including collateral reductions.  \nPremium and Accounts Receivables\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk from premiums and other accounts receivables. For premiums receivable, the exposure to loss upon a default is often mitigated by the ability to terminate the policy on default and offset the corresponding unearned premium liability. The Company has other mitigating offsets from amounts payable on commissions and profit share arrangements when the counterparty to the receivable is a sponsor/agent of the Company’s insurance product. \nThe following table presents the changes in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment for premium and accounts receivables for the periods indicated: \nGlobal Lifestyle\nGlobal Housing\nCorporate \nand Other\nTotal\nBalance, December 31, 2022\n$\n5.8\n \n$\n2.2\n \n$\n1.2\n \n$\n9.2\n \nCurrent period change for credit losses\n2.3\n \n1.1\n \n0.4\n \n3.8\n \nRecoveries\n(\n0.3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.3\n)\nWrite-offs\n(\n1.5\n)\n(\n0.9\n)\n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n3.6\n)\nForeign currency translation\n(\n0.1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.1\n)\nBalance, December 31, 2023\n6.2\n \n2.4\n \n0.4\n \n9.0\n \nCurrent period change for credit losses\n2.3\n \n0.6\n \n—\n \n2.9\n \nRecoveries\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n1.5\n)\n—\n \n(\n1.8\n)\nWrite-offs\n(\n1.6\n)\n(\n0.7\n)\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n2.6\n)\nForeign currency translation\n(\n0.3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.3\n)\nBalance, December 31, 2024\n$\n6.3\n \n$\n0.8\n \n$\n0.1\n \n$\n7.2\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the current period change for credit losses was $\n2.9\n million, primarily due to an increase in Global Lifestyle across various products. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the current period change for credit losses was $\n3.8\n million. There is a risk that income may be reduced in future periods for additional credit losses.  \nCommercial Mortgage Loans\nF-20\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the current period change for credit losses was $\n2.5\n million and $\n2.2\n million, respectively. The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by changes in certain key credit quality indicators. Refer to Notes 2 and 7\n \nfor additional information on commercial mortgage loans.\nAvailable for Sale Securities \nThere was \nno\n allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Notes 2 and 7\n \nfor additional information on available for sale securities. \nHigh Deductible Recoverables \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company reduced its allowance for credit losses for the unsecured portion of the high deductible recoverables by $\n6.9\n million to $\n1.4\n million as of December 31, 2024, due to the ongoing run-off of the sharing economy business. Refer to Note 2 for additional information on high deductible recoverables.\n5. \nSegment Information \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had \ntwo\n reportable operating segments: Global Lifestyle and Global Housing. In addition, the Company reports the Corporate and Other segment, which includes corporate employee-related expenses and activities of the holding company. \nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the chief executive officer (“CEO”). Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by the CODM to assess performance and allocate resources to the segments. The CODM budgets and forecasts for each segment based on Adjusted EBITDA then tracks and assesses performance throughout the year by comparing the actual Adjusted EBITDA to the budget or forecast for each segment. The individual operating segment performance is one of the considerations when determining the compensation of certain employees.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA, the segment measure of profitability, as net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities, non-core operations (defined below), restructuring costs related to strategic exit activities (outside of normal periodic restructuring and cost management activities), Assurant Health runoff operations (described below), interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, as well as other highly variable or unusual items.\nThe following tables provide information about the segments’ Adjusted EBITDA.\nF-21\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nGlobal Lifestyle:\nNet earned premiums, fees and other income:\nConnected Living\n$\n4,807.9\n \n$\n4,376.8\n \n$\n4,259.4\n \nGlobal Automotive\n4,159.4\n \n4,184.6\n \n3,802.5\n \nNet investment income\n356.6\n \n347.5\n \n253.6\n \nTotal revenues\n9,323.9\n \n8,908.9\n \n8,315.5\n \nPolicyholder benefits\n1,738.6\n \n1,607.9\n \n1,356.6\n \nSelling and underwriting expense (1)\n4,770.4\n \n4,789.3\n \n4,530.3\n \nCost of sales (2)\n841.6\n \n564.2\n \n528.5\n \nGeneral expenses (3)\n1,199.9\n \n1,155.2\n \n1,090.7\n \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n773.4\n \n$\n792.3\n \n$\n809.4\n \nGlobal Housing:\nNet earned premiums, fees and other income:\nHomeowners\n$\n1,958.9\n \n$\n1,663.4\n \n$\n1,402.2\n \nRenters and Other\n498.1\n \n479.5\n \n482.4\n \nNet investment income\n127.3\n \n109.7\n \n75.8\n \nTotal revenues\n2,584.3\n \n2,252.6\n \n1,960.4\n \nPolicyholder benefits\n1,010.2\n \n862.0\n \n884.1\n \nSelling and underwriting expense (1)\n158.1\n \n137.1\n \n148.9\n \nGeneral expenses (4)\n744.8\n \n679.3\n \n681.4\n \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n671.2\n \n$\n574.2\n \n$\n246.0\n \nCorporate:\nFees and other income\n$\n0.4\n \n$\n0.2\n \n$\n0.5\n \nNet investment income\n27.2\n \n21.4\n \n26.9\n \nTotal revenues\n27.6\n \n21.6\n \n27.4\n \nPolicyholder benefits\n—\n \n0.1\n \n0.5\n \nGeneral expenses (3)\n149.8\n \n130.5\n \n126.1\n \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n(\n122.2\n)\n$\n(\n109.0\n)\n$\n(\n99.2\n)\n(1)\nConsists primarily of commissions, premium taxes and amortization of deferred acquisition costs.\n(2)\nConsists primarily of costs to acquire, and repair or refurbish mobile and other electronic devices the Company sells to third-parties.\n(3)\nConsists primarily of licenses, fees, and general operating expenses.\n(4)\nConsists primarily of lender-placed tracking, licenses, fees, and general operating expenses.\nF-22\nThe following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA with a reconciliation to net income:\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nAdjusted EBITDA by segment:\nGlobal Lifestyle\n$\n773.4\n \n$\n792.3\n \n$\n809.4\n \nGlobal Housing\n671.2\n \n574.2\n \n246.0\n \nCorporate and Other\n(\n122.2\n)\n(\n109.0\n)\n(\n99.2\n)\nReconciling items to consolidated net income:\nInterest expense\n(\n107.0\n)\n(\n108.0\n)\n(\n108.3\n)\nDepreciation expense\n(\n139.4\n)\n(\n109.3\n)\n(\n86.3\n)\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n(\n69.1\n)\n(\n77.9\n)\n(\n69.7\n)\nNet realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities\n(\n75.8\n)\n(\n68.7\n)\n(\n179.7\n)\nNon-core operations (1)\n(\n14.2\n)\n(\n50.4\n)\n(\n79.5\n)\nRestructuring costs\n(\n5.4\n)\n(\n34.3\n)\n(\n53.1\n)\nAssurant Health runoff operations (2)\n—\n \n6.9\n \n(\n0.6\n)\nOther adjustments\n15.8\n \n(\n9.0\n)\n(\n29.1\n)\nTotal reconciling items\n(\n395.1\n)\n(\n450.7\n)\n(\n606.3\n)\nIncome before income tax expense\n927.3\n \n806.8\n \n349.9\n \nIncome tax expense\n167.1\n \n164.3\n \n73.3\n \nNet income\n$\n760.2\n \n$\n642.5\n \n$\n276.6\n \n(1)\nConsists of certain businesses which the Company has fully exited or expects to fully exit, including the long-tail commercial liability businesses (sharing economy and small commercial businesses), certain legacy long-duration insurance policies and the Company’s operations in mainland China (not Hong Kong) (collectively referred to as “non-core operations”). The non-core operations do not qualify as held for sale or discontinued operations under GAAP accounting guidance and are presented as a reconciling item to consolidated net income. During 2024, the mainland China operations were sold and will no longer be included in non-core operations going forward. Includes goodwill impairment of $\n7.8\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 14 for additional information.\n(2)\nIn first quarter 2023, the Company recorded income of $\n7.5\n million related to a payment it received from Time Insurance Company (“TIC”) pursuant to a participation agreement that the Company had with TIC in connection with its sale by the Company in 2018. The payment related to the Company’s prior participation in the risk adjustment program introduced by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.\nThe Company principally operates in the U.S., as well as Europe, Latin America, Canada and Asia Pacific. \nThe following table summarizes selected financial information by geographic location for the years ended or as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nLocation\nRevenues\nLong-lived\nAssets\n2024\nUnited States\n$\n9,815.5\n \n$\n681.1\n \nForeign countries\n2,062.0\n \n87.2\n \nTotal\n$\n11,877.5\n \n$\n768.3\n \n2023\nUnited States\n$\n9,295.7\n \n$\n654.6\n \nForeign countries\n1,835.9\n \n31.2\n \nTotal\n$\n11,131.6\n \n$\n685.8\n \n2022\nUnited States\n$\n8,386.6\n \n$\n606.0\n \nForeign countries\n1,806.4\n \n39.1\n \nTotal\n$\n10,193.0\n \n$\n645.1\n \nRevenue is based in the country where the product was sold and the physical location of long-lived assets, which are primarily property and equipment. \nThe following table presents total assets by segment:\nF-23\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nGlobal Lifestyle (1)\n$\n27,468.0\n \n$\n27,642.9\n \nGlobal Housing (1)\n5,773.4\n \n4,274.5\n \nCorporate and Other (2)\n1,779.2\n \n1,717.8\n \nSegment assets\n$\n35,020.6\n \n$\n33,635.2\n \n(1)\nSegment assets for Global Lifestyle and Global Housing do not include net unrealized gains (losses) on securities attributable to those segments, which are all included within Corporate and Other.\n(2)\nCorporate and Other includes the Miami, Florida property with a carrying value of $\n46.0\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, which met held-for-sale criteria and was included in other assets. The Company has ceased depreciation of these assets which are recorded at carrying value, which is less than the estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. During first quarter 2025, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Miami, Florida property to a buyer for a purchase price of $\n126.0\n million. The transaction is subject to the buyer receiving the requisite development approvals from relevant state and local government authorities, including approvals relating to land use, rezoning and site plan. There can be no assurance that the transaction will be consummated.\n \n6. \nContract Revenues \nThe Company partners with clients to provide consumers with a diverse range of protection products and services. The Company’s revenues from protection products are accounted for as insurance contracts and are recognized over the term of the insurance protection provided. Revenues from service contracts and sales of products are recognized as the contractual performance obligations are satisfied or the products are delivered. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for performing the services or transferring products. If payments are received before the related revenue is recognized, the amount is recorded as unearned revenue or advance payment liabilities, until the performance obligations are satisfied or the products are transferred. \nThe disaggregated revenues from service contracts included in fees and other income on the consolidated statements of operations are $\n1.41\n billion, $\n1.16\n billion and $\n1.09\n billion for Global Lifestyle and $\n127.8\n million, $\n84.3\n million and $\n82.9\n million for Global Housing for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.   \nGlobal Lifestyle \nIn the Global Lifestyle segment, revenues from service contracts and sales of products are primarily from the Company’s Connected Living business. Through partnerships with mobile service providers, the Company provides administrative services related to its mobile device protection products, including program design and marketing strategy, risk management, data analytics, customer support and claims handling, supply chain and service delivery, repair and logistics, and device disposition. Administrative fees are generally billed monthly based on the volume of services provided during the billing period (for example, based on the number of mobile subscribers) with payment due within a short-term period. Each service or bundle of services, depending on the contract, is an individual performance obligation with a standalone selling price. The Company recognizes revenue as it invoices, which corresponds to the value transferred to the customer.\nThe Company also repairs, refurbishes and then sells mobile and other electronic devices, on behalf of its client, for a bundled per unit fee. The entire processing of the device is considered one performance obligation with a standalone selling price and thus, the per unit fee is recognized when the products are sold. Payments are generally due prior to shipment or within a short-term period. \nGlobal Housing \nIn the Global Housing segment, revenues from service contracts and sales of products are primarily from the Homeowners business. As part of the Homeowners business, the Company provides loan and claim payment tracking services for lenders. The Company generally invoices its customers weekly or monthly based on the volume of services provided during the billing period with payment due within a short-term period. Each service is an individual performance obligation with a standalone selling price. The Company recognizes revenue as it invoices, which corresponds to the value transferred to the customer. \nContract Balances\nThe receivables and unearned revenue under these contracts were $\n171.3\n million and $\n153.8\n million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, and $\n218.9\n million and $\n155.4\n million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. These balances are included in premiums and accounts receivable and the accounts payable and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets.

The loan-to-value ratio compares the principal amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan, and is commonly expressed as a percentage. The debt-service coverage ratio compares a property’s net operating income to its debt-service payments and is commonly expressed as a ratio.

There were no consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nNon-Consolidated VIEs\nReal Estate Joint Venture and Other Partnerships\nThe Company invests in real estate joint ventures and limited partnerships, as well as closed ended real estate funds. These investments are generally accounted for under the equity method as the primary beneficiary criteria is not met; however, the Company is able to exert significant influence over the investees operating and financial policies. These investments are included in the consolidated balance sheets in other investments. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss is its recorded carrying value of $\n281.2\n million and $\n249.1\n million, respectively. The Company’s unfunded commitments were $\n239.2\n million as of December 31, 2024. \nSee Note 2 for additional information on significant accounting policies related to VIEs.\n \nF-31\n9. \nFair Value Disclosures \nFair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities Disclosures\n \nThe fair value measurements and disclosures guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company has categorized its recurring fair value basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. \nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and takes into account factors specific to the asset or liability. \nThe levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\n•\nLevel 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access.\n•\nLevel 2 inputs utilize other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the marketplace for the asset or liability. The observable inputs are used in valuation models to calculate the fair value for the asset or liability. \n•\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable but are significant to the fair value measurement for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. \nThe Company reviews fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. \nThe following tables present the Company’s fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The amounts presented below for short-term investments, other investments, cash equivalents, other assets, assets held in and liabilities related to separate accounts and other liabilities differ from the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets because only certain investments or certain assets and liabilities within these line items are measured at estimated fair value. Other investments are comprised of investments in the AIP, the ASIC plan, and the ADC and other derivatives. Other liabilities are comprised of investments in the AIP and other derivatives. The fair value amount and the majority of the associated levels presented for other investments and assets and liabilities held in separate accounts are received directly from third parties.

income.\n(3)\nTransfers are primarily attributable to changes in the availability of observable market information and the re-evaluation of the observability of valuation inputs.\nThree different valuation techniques can be used in determining fair value for financial assets and liabilities: the market, income or cost approaches. The three valuation techniques described in the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance are consistent with generally accepted valuation methodologies. \nThe market approach valuation techniques use prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. When possible, quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets are used as of the period-end date (such as for mutual funds and money market funds). Otherwise, the Company uses valuation techniques consistent with the market approach including matrix pricing and comparables. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique employed principally to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for those securities but, rather, relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Market approach valuation techniques often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables. Multiples might lie in ranges with a different multiple for each comparable. The selection of where within the range the appropriate multiple falls requires judgment, considering both qualitative and quantitative factors specific to the measurement. \nIncome approach valuation techniques convert future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount. These techniques rely on current market expectations of future amounts as of the period-end date. Examples of income approach valuation techniques include present value techniques, option-pricing models, binomial or lattice models that incorporate present value techniques and the multi-period excess earnings method. \nCost approach valuation techniques are based upon the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset at the period-end date, or the current replacement cost. That is, from the perspective of a market participant (seller), the price that would be received for the asset is determined based on the cost to a market participant (buyer) to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. \nWhile not all three approaches are applicable to all financial assets or liabilities, where appropriate, the Company may use one or more valuation techniques. For all the classes of financial assets and liabilities included in the above hierarchy, excluding certain derivatives and certain privately placed corporate bonds, the Company generally uses the market valuation technique.\nLevel 1 Securities\nThe Company’s investments and liabilities classified as Level 1 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of mutual funds and related obligations, money market funds and common stocks that are publicly listed and/or actively traded in an established market. \nLevel 2 Securities\nThe Company values Level 2 securities using various observable market inputs obtained from a pricing service or asset manager. They prepare estimates of fair value measurements for the Company’s Level 2 securities using proprietary valuation models based on techniques such as matrix pricing which include observable market inputs. The fair value measurements and disclosures guidance defines observable market inputs as the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. The extent of the use of each observable \nF-35\nmarket input for a security depends on the type of security and the market conditions at the balance sheet date. Depending on the security, the priority of the use of observable market inputs may change as some observable market inputs may not be relevant or additional inputs may be necessary. The Company uses the following observable market inputs (“standard inputs”), listed in the approximate order of priority, in the pricing evaluation of Level 2 securities: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research data. Further details for Level 2 investment types follow: \nU.S. government and government agencies and authorities:\n U.S. government and government agencies and authorities securities are priced by the Company’s pricing service utilizing standard inputs. Included in this category are U.S. Treasury securities which are priced using vendor trading platform data in addition to the standard inputs. \nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions:\n States, municipalities and political subdivisions securities are priced by the Company’s pricing service using material event notices and new issue data inputs in addition to the standard inputs. \nForeign governments:\n Foreign government securities are primarily fixed maturity securities denominated in local currencies which are priced by the Company’s pricing service using standard inputs. The pricing service also evaluates each security based on relevant market information including relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. \nCommercial mortgage-backed, residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed:\n Commercial mortgage-backed, residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are priced by the Company’s pricing service and asset managers using monthly payment information and collateral performance information in addition to the standard inputs. Additionally, commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities utilize new issue data while residential mortgage-backed securities utilize vendor trading platform data. \nU.S. and foreign corporate:\n Corporate securities are priced by the Company’s pricing service using standard inputs. Non-investment grade securities within this category are priced by the Company’s pricing service and asset managers using observations of equity and credit default swap curves related to the issuer in addition to the standard inputs. Certain privately placed corporate bonds are priced by a non-pricing service source using a model with observable inputs including the credit rating, credit spreads, sector add-ons, and issuer specific add-ons. \nNon-redeemable preferred stocks:\n Non-redeemable preferred stocks are priced by the Company’s pricing service using observations of equity and credit default swap curves related to the issuer in addition to the standard inputs. \nShort-term investments, cash equivalents, assets held in separate accounts and liabilities related to separate accounts:\n To price the fixed maturity securities and related obligations in these categories, the pricing service utilizes the standard inputs. \nOther liabilities\n: Foreign exchange forwards are priced using a pricing model which utilizes market observable inputs including foreign exchange spot rate, forward points and date to settlement. \nValuation models used by the pricing service can change from period to period, depending on the appropriate observable inputs that are available at the balance sheet date to price a security.\nLevel 3 Securities\nThe Company’s investments classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of $\n184.3\n million and $\n125.5\n million of fixed maturity and equity securities.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Level 3 fixed maturity and equities securities are priced using non-binding third-party quotes, for which the underlying quantitative inputs are not developed by the Company and are not readily available or observable.  As of December 31, 2023, the Level 3 fixed maturity securities were priced using non-binding third-party quotes.\nOther investments:\n The Company prices swaptions using a Black-Scholes pricing model incorporating third-party market data, including swap volatility data. \nOther assets\n: The Company prices options using non-binding quotes provided by market makers or broker dealers who are recognized as market participants. Inputs factored into the non-binding quotes include trades in the actual option which is being priced, deal structure, spot rates, volatility, and projected cashflows.\nF-36\nManagement evaluates the following factors in order to determine whether the market for a financial asset is inactive. The factors include:\n•\nwhether there are few recent transactions,\n•\nwhether little information is released publicly,\n•\nwhether the available prices vary significantly over time or among market participants,\n•\nwhether the prices are stale (i.e., not current), and\n•\nthe magnitude of the bid-ask spread.\nIlliquidity did not have a material impact in the fair value determination of the Company’s financial assets as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nThe Company generally obtains one price for each financial asset. The Company performs a periodic analysis to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of the financial assets’ fair values. This process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by investment and accounting professionals. Examples of procedures performed include initial and on-going review of pricing service methodologies, review of the prices received from the pricing service, review of pricing statistics and trends, and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different appropriate price sources for reasonableness. Following this analysis, the Company generally uses the best estimate of fair value based upon all available inputs. On infrequent occasions, a non-pricing service source may be more familiar with the market activity for a particular security than the pricing service. In these cases the price used is taken from the non-pricing service source. The pricing service provides information to indicate which securities were priced using market observable inputs so that the Company can properly categorize the Company’s financial assets in the fair value hierarchy.\nDisclosures for Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis \nThe Company also measures the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, generally on an annual basis, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may be affected. These assets include commercial mortgage loans, equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative, goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets.\nIn 2024 and 2023, as a result of third-party market observable transactions that were of the same issuer and determined to be similar, the Company marked certain of its equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative to fair value.  The carrying value of investments under the measurement alternative marked to fair value on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n26.6\n million and $\n3.3\n million, respectively. Given the significant unobservable inputs involved in valuation of these investments, they are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Generally, these valuations utilize the market approach, or an option pricing model backsolve method, which is a valuation approach that can be used to determine the value of common shares for companies with complex capital structures in which there have not been any recent transactions involving common shares. Inputs include capitalization tables, investment past and future performance projections, time to exit, discount rate and volatility based upon an appropriate industry group. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded fair value increases of $\n8.7\n million related to \nfive\n market observable transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded fair value increases of $\n0.6\n million related to \none\n market observable transactions and a note conversion of \ntwo\n investments.\nIn 2024 and 2023, as a result of a qualitative analysis indicating an impairment existed, the Company performed a quantitative analysis utilizing a probability weighted scenario model and determined certain investments were impaired. Model inputs include capitalization tables, investment past and future company performance projections, and discount rate. Based upon model outputs, impairments of $\n23.8\n million and $\n12.9\n million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.   \nRefer to Note 14 for the results of the 2024 goodwill impairment testing.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments Disclosures \nThe financial instruments guidance requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate such fair value. Therefore, it requires fair value disclosure for financial instruments that are not recognized or are not carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. However, this guidance excludes certain financial instruments, including those related to insurance contracts and those accounted for under the equity method (such as partnerships).\nFor the financial instruments included within the following financial assets and financial liabilities, the carrying value in the consolidated balance sheets equals or approximates fair value. Please refer to the Fair Values Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities Disclosures section above for additional information on the financial \nF-37\ninstruments included within the following financial assets and financial liabilities and the methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value:\n•\nCash and cash equivalents;\n•\nFixed maturity securities;\n•\nEquity securities;\n•\nShort-term investments;\n•\nOther investments;\n•\nOther assets;\n•\nAssets held in separate accounts;\n•\nOther liabilities; and\n•\nLiabilities related to separate accounts.\nIn estimating the fair value of the financial instruments that are not recognized or are not carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, the Company used the following methods and assumptions: \nCommercial mortgage loans on real estate\n: The fair value of commercial mortgage loans on real estate utilizes a third-party matrix pricing model. For fixed rate loans, the matrix process uses a yield buildup approach to create a pricing yield, with components for base yield, credit quality spread, property type spread, and a weighted average life spread. Floating rate loans are priced with a target quality spread over the swap curve. A dollar price for each loan is derived from the pricing yield or spread by a discounted cash flow methodology. \nOther investments:\n Other investments include low income housing tax credits, business debentures, and credit tenant loans which are recorded at cost or amortized cost, as well as policy loans. The carrying value reported for these investments approximates fair value. \nOther assets: \nThe carrying value of dealer loans approximates fair value. \nPolicy reserves under investment products\n: The fair values for the Company’s policy reserves under investment products are determined using discounted cash flow analysis.

The change in liability for prior year tax in 2024 was primarily related to additional transferable federal tax credits taken on the 2023 income tax return.\n(3)\nPursuant to provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Company purchased transferable federal tax credits during 2024 from various counterparties. Such federal tax credits were purchased at negotiated discounts, resulting in an income tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024. Amounts owed to counterparties for the purchased credits are recorded within accounts payable and accrued expenses within the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n(\n17.0\n)\n$\n(\n18.5\n)\n$\n(\n18.5\n)\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n(\n0.9\n)\n(\n0.9\n)\n(\n0.6\n)\nReductions based on tax positions related to the current year\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n(\n2.1\n)\n(\n0.5\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n2.7\n \n2.9\n \n0.8\n \nLapses\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nBalance at end of year\n$\n(\n17.3\n)\n$\n(\n17.0\n)\n$\n(\n18.5\n)\nF-40\nTotal unrecognized tax benefits of $\n20.4\n million, $\n19.2\n million and $\n20.4\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which includes interest and penalties, would impact the Company’s consolidated effective tax rate if recognized. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is included in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n \nThe Company’s continuing practice is to recognize interest expense related to income tax matters in income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized approximately $\n1.2\n million, $\n0.4\n million and $\n0.7\n million, respectively, of interest expense related to income tax matters. The Company had $\n4.0\n million, $\n2.8\n million and $\n2.4\n million of interest accrued as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company had $\n1.2\n million penalties accrued as of December 31, 2024 and \nno\n penalties accrued as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company does not anticipate any significant increase or decrease of unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months. \nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has substantially concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for years through 2015. Substantially all non-U.S. income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2012, and all state and local income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that result in significant deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows as of the dates indicated: \n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nDeferred Tax Assets\nPolicyholder and separate account reserves\n$\n506.4\n \n$\n538.3\n \nNet operating loss carryforwards\n37.1\n \n43.4\n \nNet unrealized appreciation on securities\n79.8\n \n87.7\n \nCredit carryforwards\n30.6\n \n9.9\n \nEmployee and post-retirement benefits\n9.1\n \n8.6\n \nCompensation related\n44.2\n \n43.9\n \nCapital loss carryforwards\n19.1\n \n12.1\n \nInvestments, net\n11.5\n \n—\n \nOther\n84.3\n \n65.3\n \nTotal deferred tax assets\n822.1\n \n809.2\n \nLess valuation allowance\n(\n16.7\n)\n(\n16.1\n)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n805.4\n \n793.1\n \nDeferred Tax Liabilities\nDeferred acquisition costs\n(\n1,077.7\n)\n(\n1,161.0\n)\nInvestments, net\n—\n \n(\n0.6\n)\nIntangible assets\n(\n94.3\n)\n(\n101.5\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(\n1,172.0\n)\n(\n1,263.1\n)\nNet deferred income tax liabilities\n$\n(\n366.6\n)\n$\n(\n470.0\n)\nA cumulative valuation allowance of $\n16.7\n million existed as of December 31, 2024 and $\n16.1\n million  as of December 31, 2023 based on management’s assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets attributable to international subsidiaries will not be realized.\n \nThe Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on its ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the same character within the carryback or carryforward periods. In assessing future taxable income, the Company considered all sources of taxable income available to realize its deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies. If changes occur in the assumptions underlying the Company’s tax planning strategies or in the scheduling of the reversal of the Company’s deferred tax liabilities, the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future.\n \nF-41\nOther than for certain wholly owned Canadian and Latin American subsidiaries, the Company plans to indefinitely reinvest the earnings in other jurisdictions. Under current U.S. tax law, no material income taxes are anticipated on future repatriation of earnings. Therefore, deferred taxes have not been provided\n.\nThe net operating loss carryforwards by jurisdiction are as follows as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nFederal net operating loss carryforwards\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nForeign net operating loss carryforwards (1)\n$\n146.6\n \n$\n164.9\n \n(1)\nOf the $\n146.6\n million as of December 31, 2024, $\n19.8\n million expires between 2025 and 2044, and $\n126.8\n million has an unlimited carryforward.\n12. \nDeferred Acquisition Costs \nInformation about deferred acquisition costs is as follows as of the dates indicated:\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n9,967.2\n \n$\n9,677.1\n \n$\n8,811.0\n \nCosts deferred\n3,991.2\n \n4,409.8\n \n4,528.7\n \nAmortization\n(\n3,965.6\n)\n(\n4,119.7\n)\n(\n3,662.6\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n9,992.8\n \n$\n9,967.2\n \n$\n9,677.1\n \n13. \nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following as of the dates indicated:\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nLand\n$\n6.2\n \n$\n6.5\n \nBuildings and improvements\n166.3\n \n141.6\n \nFurniture, fixtures and equipment\n117.6\n \n91.6\n \nSoftware\n979.0\n \n838.7\n \nTotal\n1,269.1\n \n1,078.4\n \nLess accumulated depreciation\n(\n500.8\n)\n(\n392.6\n)\nTotal\n$\n768.3\n \n$\n685.8\n \nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $\n139.4\n million, $\n109.3\n million and $\n86.3\n million, respectively. Depreciation expense is included in underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. \nThe assets of the Miami, Florida office met held-for-sale criteria in second quarter 2023 and were reclassified from property and equipment, net, to other assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. The Company has ceased depreciation of these assets which are recorded at carrying value of $\n46.0\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, which is less than the estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. During first quarter 2025, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Miami, Florida property to a buyer for a purchase price of $\n126.0\n million. If the transaction is consummated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company expects to record a gain above the carrying value, less estimated costs to sell. There can be no assurance that the transaction will be consummated.\n14. \nGoodwill \nThe Company has assigned goodwill to its reporting units for impairment testing purposes. The Company has \nthree\n reporting units consisting of \ntwo\n reporting units within the Global Lifestyle operating segment, Connected Living and Global Automotive, and Global Housing (whereby the reporting unit for impairment testing was at the operating segment level). In 2023, the Company reassessed its reporting units and determined that the Global Financial Services component should be aggregated with other business components within the Connected Living reporting unit because the business is managed by the \nF-42\nsame business leader and have similar economic characteristics as required by the aggregation criteria. The new combined Connected Living reporting unit meets the accounting definition of a single reporting unit.\nQualitative Impairment Testing\nFor the annual October 1, 2024 goodwill impairment test, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for all reporting units with goodwill (Connected Living, Global Automotive and Global Housing) due to high margins between fair value and book value based on quantitative impairment testing in 2023. In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analy\nzed changes in the book value and the financial performance of each reporting unit, including analyzing the historical performance versus plan and the results of quantitative impairment testing performed in 2023. Additionally, the Company assessed critical areas that may impact the reporting units, including macroeconomic and industry trends and market information for the reporting units and their peer companies that could impact the reporting units’ fair value. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the reporting units’ fair values were more than their respective book values and therefore quantitative impairment testing was not necessary for Connected Living, Global Automotive and Global Housing.\nQuantitative Impairment Testing\nFor the annual October 1, 2023 goodwill impairment test, the Company performed quantitative tests for all reporting units with goodwill (Connected Living, Global Automotive and Global Housing).\nThe following describes the various valuation methodologies used in the quantitative test which were weighted using our judgment as to which were the most representative in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units.\nA Dividend Discount Method (“DDM”) was used to value each of the reporting units based upon the present value of expected cash flows available for distribution over future periods. Cash flows were estimated for a discrete projection period based on detailed assumptions, and a terminal value was calculated to reflect the value attributable to cash flows beyond the discrete period. Cash flows and the terminal value were then discounted using each reporting unit’s estimated cost of capital. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit represented the sum of the discounted cash flows and terminal value.\nA Guideline Company Method, in which we identified a group of peer companies that have similar operations to the reporting unit, was used; however, direct peer comparisons for the reporting units were limited given the diversity of the products and services within the businesses. This method was used to value each reporting unit based upon its relative performance to peer companies, based on several measures, including price to trailing 12-month earnings, price to projected earnings, price to tangible net worth and return on equity.\nWhile DDM and Guideline Company valuation methodologies were considered in assessing fair value, the DDM was weighted more heavily since management believes that expected cash flows are the most important factor in the valuation of a business enterprise, and also considering the lack of directly-comparable peer companies. Based on the quantitative assessment performed as of October 1, 2023, the Company concluded that the estimated fair values of the Connected Living, Global Automotive and Global Housing reporting units exceeded their respective book values and therefore determined that the assigned goodwill was not impaired.\nSharing Economy and Small Commercial Businesses Impairment \nIn second quarter of 2022, $\n7.8\n million of goodwill, previously included in Global Housing, was allocated to the sharing economy and small commercial businesses which are included within non-core operations in Corporate and Other. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company identified impairment indicators impacting the fair value of the sharing economy and small commercial businesses, including a decline in long-term economic performance. The fair value of the sharing economy and small commercial businesses was determined using a discounted cash flow method which calculated the present value of the run-off results and considered all aspects of the business including investment assumptions. The fair value calculated in the fourth quarter of 2022 was lower than the carrying value of the run-off businesses, resulting in the pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge of the entire goodwill of $\n7.8\n million. The goodwill impairment charge was reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, with a corresponding reduction to goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nF-43\nA roll forward of goodwill by reportable segment is provided below as of and for the years indicated: \nGlobal Lifestyle (1)\nGlobal Housing\nCorporate and Other\nConsolidated\nBalance at December 31, 2022 (2)\n$\n2,193.9\n \n$\n409.1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,603.0\n \nTransfers (3)\n92.4\n \n(\n92.4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nForeign currency translation and other\n5.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n5.8\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023 (2)\n2,292.1\n \n316.7\n \n—\n \n2,608.8\n \nAcquisitions\n11.4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n11.4\n \nForeign currency translation and other\n(\n4.2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n4.2\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024 (2)\n$\n2,299.3\n \n$\n316.7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,616.0\n \n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n793.6\n million and $\n1,505.7\n million of goodwill was assigned to the Connected Living and Global Automotive reporting units, respectively.

The main product lines for Global Housing include lender-placed homeowners, manufactured housing and flood insurance; voluntary manufactured housing, condominium and homeowners insurance; and renters insurance. \nTotal IBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case basis incurred losses from the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates. Ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated utilizing generally accepted actuarial loss reserving methods. The reserving methods employed by the Company include the Chain Ladder, Munich Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Reportable catastrophe losses are analyzed and reserved for separately using a frequency and severity approach. The methods involve aggregating paid and case-incurred loss data by accident quarter (or accident year) and accident age for each product grouping. As the data ages, loss development factors are calculated that measure emerging claim development patterns between reporting periods. By selecting loss development factors indicative of remaining development, known losses are projected to an ultimate incurred basis for each accident period. The underlying premise of the Chain Ladder \nF-45\nmethod is that future claims development is best estimated using past claims development, whereas the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method employs a combination of past claims development and an estimate of ultimate losses based on an expected loss ratio. The Munich Chain Ladder method takes into account the correlations between paid and incurred development in projecting future development factors and is typically more applicable to products experiencing greater variability in incurred to paid ratios. \nThe best estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense is generally selected from a blend of the different methods that are applied consistently each period considering significant assumptions, including projected loss development factors and expected loss ratios. There have been no significant changes in the methodologies and assumptions utilized in estimating the liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for any of the periods presented.\nNon-core Operations\nShort duration contracts in non-core operations consist of the sharing economy and small commercial products previously reported within Global Housing and the Company’s operations in mainland China. While the sharing economy and small commercial contracts are classified as short duration, the coverages were predominantly commercial liability and have a long reporting and settlement tail compared to property coverages which make up most of the Company’s core operations. \nThe reserving methodology described for continuing short duration business is applicable for non-core operations (sharing economy and small commercial). Given the nature of commercial liability coverages and its relatively long claim runoff duration, additional emphasis is placed on social inflation impacts and analysis of individual case reserve adequacy on known claims. This is done through use of average cost per claim methods that include allowance for future inflation impacts, detailed open claim inventory analysis, and leveraging industry development patterns to supplement the Company’s own historical claims experience.\nDisposed and Runoff Short Duration Insurance Lines\nShort duration contracts within the disposed business include certain medical policies no longer offered and Assurant Employee Benefits policies disposed of via reinsurance. Reserves and reinsurance recoverables for previously disposed business are included in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 17 for additional information. \nThe Company has runoff exposure to asbestos, environmental and other general liability claims arising from the Company’s participation in certain reinsurance pools from 1971 through 1985 from contracts discontinued many years ago. The amount of carried case reserves are based on recommendations of the various pool managers. Using information currently available, and after consideration of the reserves reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company does not believe or expect that changes in reserve estimates for these claims are likely to be material. \nF-46\nLong Duration Contracts\nThe following table presents the balances and changes in the long-term care future policy benefits and expenses reserve:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPresent value of expected net premiums\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n36.4\n \n$\n34.2\n \n$\n37.1\n \nBeginning balance at original discount rate\n36.5\n \n33.4\n \n29.2\n \nEffect of changes in cash flow assumptions (1)\n(\n1.0\n)\n1.5\n \n9.4\n \nEffect of actual variances from expected experience\n0.9\n \n3.5\n \n(\n2.7\n)\nAdjusted beginning of period balance\n36.4\n \n38.4\n \n35.9\n \nExperience variance (2)\n0.1\n \n—\n \n(\n0.3\n)\nInterest accrual\n3.4\n \n2.8\n \n4.6\n \nNet premiums collected\n(\n5.9\n)\n(\n4.7\n)\n(\n6.8\n)\nEnding balance at original discount rate\n34.0\n \n36.5\n \n33.4\n \nEffect of changes in discount rate assumptions\n2.4\n \n(\n0.1\n)\n0.8\n \nBalance, end of period\n$\n36.4\n \n$\n36.4\n \n$\n34.2\n \nPresent value of expected future policy benefits\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n450.6\n \n$\n462.4\n \n$\n658.5\n \nBeginning balance at original discount rate\n453.0\n \n444.4\n \n430.0\n \nEffect of changes in cash flow assumptions (1)\n—\n \n—\n \n12.3\n \nEffect of actual variances from expected experience\n1.5\n \n4.4\n \n(\n3.3\n)\nAdjusted beginning of period balance\n454.5\n \n448.8\n \n439.0\n \nExperience variance (2)\n(\n1.3\n)\n1.0\n \n(\n1.2\n)\nInterest accrual\n26.2\n \n19.5\n \n24.7\n \nBenefit payments\n(\n26.5\n)\n(\n16.3\n)\n(\n18.1\n)\nEnding balance at original discount rate\n452.9\n \n453.0\n \n444.4\n \nEffect of changes in discount rate assumptions\n53.5\n \n(\n2.4\n)\n18.0\n \nBalance, end of period\n$\n506.4\n \n$\n450.6\n \n$\n462.4\n \nNet future policy benefits and expenses\n$\n470.0\n \n$\n414.2\n \n$\n428.2\n \nRelated reinsurance recoverable\n470.0\n \n414.2\n \n428.2\n \nNet future policy benefits and expenses, after reinsurance recoverable\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nWeighted-average liability duration of the future policy benefits and expenses (in years)\n11.4\n12.0\n12.7\n(1)\nThe increase for the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022 was primarily due to historical experience reflecting a decreasing trend in lapse and mortality rates on the long-term care insurance products.  \n(2)\nExperience variance includes adverse development resulting from the allocation of the premium deficiency reserve to the cohort level for issue years where net premiums exceed gross premiums.\nF-47\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the long-term care net future policy benefits and expenses to the future policy benefits and expenses reserve in the consolidated balance sheet:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nLong-term care\n$\n470.0\n \n$\n414.2\n \nOther\n66.7\n \n73.0\n \nTotal\n$\n536.7\n \n$\n487.2\n \nThe following table presents the amount of undiscounted expected future benefit payments and expected gross premiums for the long-term care insurance contracts:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nExpected future benefits payments\n$\n804.4\n \n$\n829.3\n \nExpected future gross premiums\n$\n61.9\n \n$\n69.4\n \nThe following table presents the amount of long-term care revenue and interest recognized in the consolidated statements of operations:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nGross premiums\n$\n1.4\n \n$\n1.5\n \n$\n1.7\n \nInterest expense (original discount rate)\n$\n5.7\n \n$\n5.6\n \n$\n4.7\n \nThe following table presents the weighted-average interest rate for long-term care insurance contracts:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nInterest expense (original discount rate)\n5.95\n \n%\n5.95\n \n%\nCurrent discount rate\n4.63\n \n%\n6.01\n \n%\nReserve Roll Forward\nThe following table provides a roll forward of the Company’s beginning and ending claims and benefits payable balances. Claims and benefits payable is the liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and are comprised of case and IBNR reserves. These balances do not include the recoverable amounts related to certain high deductible policies in the sharing economy business, included in the non-core operations, for which the Company is responsible for paying the entirety of the claim and is subsequently reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had exposure of $\n168.2\n million of reserves below the deductible that it would be responsible for if the clients were to default on their contractual obligation to pay the deductible. Refer to Note 4 for more information on the evaluation of the credit risk exposure from these recoverables.\nSince unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimates, the Company’s actual losses incurred may be more or less than the Company’s previously developed estimates, which is referred to as either unfavorable or favorable development, respectively.\nF-48\nThe best estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses is generally selected from a blend of methods that are applied consistently each period. There have been no significant changes in the methodologies and assumptions utilized in estimating the liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for any of the periods presented. \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nClaims and benefits payable, at beginning of year\n$\n1,989.2\n \n$\n2,210.0\n \n$\n1,523.0\n \nLess: Reinsurance ceded and other\n(\n886.6\n)\n(\n1,228.8\n)\n(\n744.1\n)\nNet claims and benefits payable, at beginning of year\n1,102.6\n \n981.2\n \n778.9\n \nIncurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to:\nCurrent year\n2,893.8\n \n2,548.4\n \n2,304.3\n \nPrior years\n(\n127.3\n)\n(\n26.6\n)\n55.5\n \nTotal incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses\n2,766.5\n \n2,521.8\n \n2,359.8\n \nPaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to:\nCurrent year\n2,021.8\n \n1,802.3\n \n1,648.1\n \nPrior years\n602.9\n \n598.1\n \n509.4\n \nTotal paid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n2,624.7\n \n2,400.4\n \n2,157.5\n \nNet claims and benefits payable, at end of year\n1,244.4\n \n1,102.6\n \n981.2\n \nPlus: Reinsurance ceded and other (1)\n1,669.8\n \n886.6\n \n1,228.8\n \nClaims and benefits payable, at end of year (1)\n$\n2,914.2\n \n$\n1,989.2\n \n$\n2,210.0\n \n(1)\nIncludes reinsurance recoverables and claims and benefits payable of $\n911.7\n million, $\n123.6\n million and $\n424.3\n million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which were ceded to the U.S. government.

Global Lifestyle experienced net favorable development in 2024, 2023 and 2022 of $\n18.9\n million, $\n23.6\n million and $\n45.4\n million, respectively. Global Lifestyle experienced similar amounts of net favorable development in 2024 and 2023. The decrease in net favorable development from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to Global Automotive ancillary products as the used car market began to normalize in 2023 and the high net favorable development experienced in 2022 did not repeat. Global Housing experienced net favorable loss development in 2024 and 2023 of $\n109.7\n million and $\n37.1\n million, respectively, as claim experience for lender-placed homeowners insurance developed favorably due to easing inflation and favorable frequency compared to initial estimates established during a period with high market uncertainty, stabilization of claim settlement lags, and legislation reform in Florida. Global Housing experienced net unfavorable development of $\n28.9\n million in 2022, primarily due to lender-placed homeowners insurance affected by longer claim settlement lags and inflationary impacts. The non-core operations, which includes the sharing economy and small commercial businesses and the company’s operations in mainland China, contributed net unfavorable loss development of $\n13.6\n million, $\n40.1\n million, and $\n77.4\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A more detailed explanation of the claims development from Global Lifestyle, Global Housing and non-core operations is presented below, including claims development by accident year. Reserves for the longer-tail property and casualty coverages included in All Other (e.g., asbestos, environmental and other general liability) had no material changes in estimated amounts for claims incurred in prior years. \nThe following tables represent the Global Lifestyle, Global Housing and non-core operations incurred claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, less cumulative paid claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance to reconcile to total claims and benefits payable, net of reinsurance as of December 31, 2024. The tables \nF-49\nprovide undiscounted information about claims development by accident year for the significant short duration claims and benefits payable balances. \nThe following factors are relevant to the loss development information included in the tables below: \n•\nTable Presentation:\n The tables are organized by accident year. For certain categories of claims and for reinsurance recoverables, losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to us. These reclassifications are shown as development in the respective years in the tables below. Predominantly, the Company writes short-tail lines that are written on an occurrence basis. Five years of claims development information is provided since most of the claims are fully developed after five years, as shown in the average payout ratio tables. \n•\nTable Groupings:\n The groupings have homogeneous risk characteristics with similar development patterns and would generally be subject to similar trends and reflect our reportable segments. \n•\nImpact of Reinsurance:\n The reinsurance program varies by exposure type. Historically, the Company has leveraged facultative and treaty reinsurance, both on pro-rata and excess of loss basis. The reinsurance program may change from year to year, which may affect the comparability of the data presented in the tables. \n•\nIBNR:\n Includes development from past reported losses in IBNR. \n•\nInformation excluded from tables:\n Unallocated loss adjustment expenses are excluded from the tables. \n•\nForeign exchange rates:\n The loss development for operations outside of the U.S. is presented for all accident years using the current exchange rates at December 31, 2024. Although this approach requires restating all prior accident year information, the changes in exchange rates do not impact incurred and paid loss development trends. \n•\nAcquisitions:\n Includes acquisitions from all accident years presented in the tables. For purposes of this disclosure, we have applied the retrospective method for the acquired reserves, including incurred and paid claim development histories throughout the relevant tables. It should be noted that historical reserves for the acquired business were established by the acquired companies using methods, assumptions and procedures then in effect which may differ from our current reserving bases. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future reserve adequacy based on the aggregated historical results shown in the tables. \n•\nDispositions:\n Excludes dispositions from all accident years presented in the tables. \n•\nClaim counts:\n Considers a reported claim to be one claim for each claimant or feature for each loss occurrence. Reported claims for losses from assumed reinsurance contracts are not available and hence not included in the reported claims. There are limitations that should be considered on the reported claim count data in the tables below, including: \n◦\nClaim counts are presented only on a reported (not an ultimate) basis; \n◦\nThe tables below include lines of business and geographies at a certain aggregated level which may indicate different frequency and severity trends and characteristics, and may not be as meaningful as the claim count information related to the individual products within those lines of business and geographies; \n◦\nCertain lines of business are more likely to be subject to occurrences involving multiple claimants and features, which can distort measures based on the reported claim counts in the table below; and \n◦\nReported claim counts are not adjusted for ceded reinsurance, which may distort the measure of frequency or severity. \n•\nRequired Supplemental Information:\n The information about incurred and paid loss development for all periods preceding year ended December 31, 2024 and the related historical claims payout percentage disclosure is unaudited and is presented as required supplementary information. \nF-50\nGlobal Lifestyle Net Claims Development Tables \nIncurred Claims and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance\nDecember 31, 2024\nYears Ended December 31,\nTotal of Incurred-but-Not Reported Liabilities Plus Expected Development on Reported Claims (1)\nCumulative Number of Reported Claims (2)\nAccident Year\n2020 Unaudited\n2021 Unaudited\n2022 Unaudited\n2023 Unaudited\n2024\n2020\n$\n1,423.9\n \n$\n1,398.1\n \n$\n1,398.4\n \n$\n1,396.3\n \n$\n1,394.7\n \n$\n0.3\n \n9,597,590\n \n2021\n1,330.7\n \n1,278.7\n \n1,276.2\n \n1,275.2\n \n0.5\n \n9,689,514\n \n2022\n1,373.9\n \n1,358.6\n \n1,354.6\n \n2.5\n \n9,394,247\n \n2023\n1,611.2\n \n1,598.5\n \n7.5\n \n8,230,700\n \n2024\n1,769.9\n \n242.2\n \n7,504,772\n \nTotal\n$\n7,392.9\n \nCumulative Paid Claims and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance\nYears Ended December 31,\nAccident Year\n2020 Unaudited\n2021 Unaudited\n2022 Unaudited\n2023 Unaudited\n2024\n2020\n$\n1,205.5\n \n$\n1,382.2\n \n$\n1,388.7\n \n$\n1,390.6\n \n$\n1,392.2\n \n2021\n1,108.5\n \n1,266.6\n \n1,270.6\n \n1,272.5\n \n2022\n1,152.8\n \n1,345.7\n \n1,349.8\n \n2023\n1,351.0\n \n1,586.3\n \n2024\n1,421.7\n \nTotal\n$\n7,022.5\n \nOutstanding claims and benefits payable before 2020, net of reinsurance\n5.5\n \nClaims and benefits payable, net of reinsurance\n$\n375.9\n \nAverage Annual Payout of Incurred Claims by Age, Net of Reinsurance\nYear 1 Unaudited\nYear 2 Unaudited\nYear 3 Unaudited\nYear 4 Unaudited\nYear 5 Unaudited\n85.7\n%\n13.7\n%\n0.4\n%\n0.1\n%\n0.1\n%\n(1)\nIncludes a provision for development on case reserves.\n(2)\nNumber of paid claims plus open (pending) claims. Claim count information related to ceded reinsurance is not reflected as it cannot be reasonably defined or quantified, given that the Company’s reinsurance includes non-proportional treaties.\nUsing the December 31, 2024 foreign exchange rates for all years, Global Lifestyle experienced $\n18.9\n million of net favorable loss development for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to net favorable loss development of $\n23.6\n million and $\n45.4\n million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts are based on the change in net incurred losses from the claims development tables above, plus additional impacts from accident years prior to 2020. Many of these contracts and products contain retrospective commission (profit sharing) provisions that would result in offsetting increases or decreases in expense dependent on if the development was favorable or unfavorable.  \nDevelopment from Global Lifestyle is attributable to nearly all lines of business across most of the Company’s regions with a concentration on more recent accident years and based on emerging evaluations regarding loss experience each period. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Global Lifestyle net favorable development of $\n18.9\n million was attributable to Connected Living which contributed $\n21.5\n million comprised of $\n9.9\n million from credit and other insurance, $\n2.0\n million from mobile and $\n9.6\n million from extended service contracts. The favorable development from credit and other insurance was primarily due to refinements in reserve methods coupled with an improving portfolio mix for Europe and the release of reserves for Canadian credit and travel programs where loss assumptions related to COVID-19 did not materialize.  For extended service contracts, improvements in data quality for certain US clients allowed for reserve releases and resulted in favorable reserve refinements. Global Automotive experienced net unfavorable development of $\n2.6\n million, driven by higher claim frequencies as more vehicles met the loss criteria in an asset protection product. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Global Lifestyle net favorable development was primarily attributable to favorable runoff of international credit products where loss assumptions related to inflation and COVID-19 did not materialize. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the release of reserves related to Global Automotive ancillary products due to the strong used vehicle market was a contributing factor.  \nForeign exchange rate movements over time caused some of the reserve differences shown in the reserve roll forward and prior year incurred loss tables to vary from what is reflected in the claims development tables for Global Lifestyle. The impacts \nF-51\nby year were $(\n0.9\n) million, $\n0.3\n million, and $(\n0.4\n) million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The claims development tables above remove the impact due to changing foreign exchange rates over time for comparability. \nGlobal Housing Net Claims Development Tables\nIncurred Claims and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance\nDecember 31, 2024\nYears Ended December 31,\nTotal of Incurred-but-Not Reported Liabilities Plus Expected Development on Reported Claims (1)\nCumulative Number of Reported Claims (2)\nAccident Year\n2020 Unaudited\n2021 Unaudited\n2022 Unaudited\n2023 Unaudited\n2024\n2020\n$\n804.1\n \n$\n804.8\n \n$\n834.4\n \n$\n848.9\n \n$\n847.3\n \n$\n11.4\n \n191,428\n \n2021\n784.0\n \n769.0\n \n770.5\n \n761.4\n \n14.5\n \n194,998\n \n2022\n862.4\n \n809.4\n \n803.3\n \n38.0\n \n187,384\n \n2023\n901.4\n \n814.0\n \n131.8\n \n177,977\n \n2024\n1,123.1\n \n441.8\n \n201,149\n \nTotal\n$\n4,349.1\n \nCumulative Paid Claims and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance\nYears Ended December 31,\nAccident Year\n2020 Unaudited\n2021 Unaudited\n2022 Unaudited\n2023 Unaudited\n2024\n2020\n$\n528.8\n \n$\n730.0\n \n$\n793.0\n \n$\n820.8\n \n$\n831.9\n \n2021\n517.6\n \n690.3\n \n727.8\n \n743.0\n \n2022\n467.7\n \n701.3\n \n754.5\n \n2023\n450.9\n \n665.3\n \n2024\n597.9\n \nTotal\n$\n3,592.6\n \nOutstanding claims and benefits payable before 2020, net of reinsurance\n9.9\n \nClaims and benefits payable, net of reinsurance\n$\n766.4\n \nAverage Annual Payout of Incurred Claims by Age, Net of Reinsurance\nYear 1 Unaudited\nYear 2 Unaudited\nYear 3 Unaudited\nYear 4 Unaudited\nYear 5 Unaudited\n62.5\n%\n26.8\n%\n6.6\n%\n2.8\n%\n1.4\n%\n(1)\nIncludes a provision for development on case reserves.\n(2)\nNumber of paid claims plus open (pending) claims.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the net favorable development for Global Housing was attributable to non-catastrophe claim experience for lender-placed homeowners insurance, as claim experience developed favorably due to easing inflation and favorable frequency compared to initial estimates established during a period with high market uncertainty, stabilization of claim settlement lags, and legislation reform in Florida. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the net favorable development for Global Housing was attributable to similar factors as described for the year ended December 31, 2024.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, the net unfavorable development for Global Housing was attributable to lender-placed homeowners insurance, primarily accident year 2020, due to longer claim settlement lags for water damage claims and inflation. \nF-52\nNon-core Operations Net Claims Development Tables \nIncurred Claims and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance\nDecember 31, 2024\nYears Ended December 31,\nTotal of Incurred-but-Not Reported Liabilities Plus Expected Development on Reported Claims (1)\nCumulative Number of Reported Claims (2)\nAccident Year\n2020 Unaudited\n2021 Unaudited\n2022 Unaudited\n2023 Unaudited\n2024\n2020\n$\n51.3\n \n$\n47.9\n \n$\n70.9\n \n$\n85.0\n \n$\n81.4\n \n$\n5.8\n \n58,228\n \n2021\n52.5\n \n74.0\n \n98.3\n \n102.1\n \n17.6\n \n54,679\n \n2022\n40.0\n \n45.7\n \n55.4\n \n5.0\n \n27,349\n \n2023\n7.2\n \n8.5\n \n3.5\n \n13,802\n \n2024\n0.5\n \n—\n \n1,210\n \nTotal\n$\n247.9\n \nCumulative Paid Claims and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance\nYears Ended December 31,\nAccident Year\n2020 Unaudited\n2021 Unaudited\n2022 Unaudited\n2023 Unaudited\n2024\n2020\n$\n20.0\n \n$\n30.0\n \n$\n42.6\n \n$\n60.8\n \n$\n69.9\n \n2021\n20.8\n \n38.1\n \n58.4\n \n76.3\n \n2022\n10.2\n \n19.4\n \n44.1\n \n2023\n3.3\n \n4.6\n \n2024\n—\n \nTotal\n$\n194.9\n \nOutstanding claims and benefits payable before 2019, net of reinsurance\n16.5\n \nClaims and benefits payable, net of reinsurance\n$\n69.5\n \nAverage Annual Payout of Incurred Claims by Age, Net of Reinsurance\nYear 1 Unaudited\nYear 2 Unaudited\nYear 3 Unaudited\nYear 4 Unaudited\nYear 5 Unaudited\n22.9\n%\n16.3\n%\n28.0\n%\n21.1\n%\n11.7\n%\n(1)\nIncludes a provision for development on case reserves.\n(2)\nNumber of paid claims plus open (pending) claims.

Claim count information related to ceded reinsurance is not reflected as it cannot be reasonably defined or quantified, given that the Company’s reinsurance includes non-proportional treaties.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, non-core operations contributed net unfavorable loss development of $\n13.6\n million, $\n40.1\n million, and $\n77.4\n million, including $\n1.3\n million, $(\n0.5\n) million and $\n15.3\n million from small commercial and $\n12.3\n million, $\n40.6\n million and $\n62.1\n million from sharing economy products, respectively. The Company stopped writing new small commercial business in 2019 and the claims are in runoff. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the net unfavorable development in sharing economy was attributable to reserve increases related to higher settlement values, primarily for accident years 2019 and 2020. In second quarter 2023, the Company entered into a retroactive reinsurance treaty to cover certain known losses and adverse development up to a $\n50.0\n million aggregate limit, relating to the small commercial business. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the net unfavorable development from sharing economy was driven by emerging adverse claim development trends on known claims as well as reserve assumption revisions to reflect relevant industry benchmarks. Both sharing economy and small commercial experienced unfavorable development in the year ended December 31, 2022 on known claims driven by social inflation and the release of the backlog from courts reopening after COVID-19.  \nF-53\nReconciliation of the Disclosure of Net Incurred and Paid Claims Development to the Liability for Unpaid Claims and Benefits Payable \nDecember 31, 2024\nNet outstanding liabilities\nGlobal Lifestyle\n$\n375.9\n \nGlobal Housing\n766.4\n \nNon-core operations\n69.5\n \nOther short-duration insurance lines (1)\n15.9\n \nDisposed business short-duration insurance lines (Assurant Health)\n1.1\n \nClaims and benefits payable, net of reinsurance\n1,228.8\n \nReinsurance recoverable on unpaid claims\nGlobal Lifestyle (2)\n498.2\n \nGlobal Housing\n1,105.8\n \nNon-core operations\n50.4\n \nOther short-duration insurance lines (1)\n0.9\n \nDisposed business short-duration insurance lines (Assurant Employee Benefits and Assurant Health)\n12.2\n \nTotal reinsurance recoverable on unpaid claims\n1,667.5\n \nInsurance lines other than short-duration (3)\n2.2\n \nUnallocated claim adjustment expense\n15.7\n \nOther\n—\n \nTotal claims and benefits payable\n$\n2,914.2\n \n(1)\nAsbestos and pollution reserves represents $\n13.4\n million of the other short-duration insurance lines, with $\n0.9\n million recoveries.  \n(2)\nDisposed of property and casualty business represents $\n153.5\n million of the $\n498.2\n million in reinsurance recoverables for Global Lifestyle. \n(3)\nAmount consists of certain long-duration contract exposures, primarily claims and benefits payable on run-off blocks of universal life policies.\n \n17. \nReinsurance\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non-affiliated companies.

Thus, a credit exposure exists to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed in the reinsurance agreements. \nThe following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nCeded future policyholder benefits and expense\n$\n340.7\n \n$\n339.9\n \nCeded unearned premium\n5,188.5\n \n5,265.2\n \nCeded claims and benefits payable\n1,808.9\n \n971.4\n \nCeded paid losses\n241.4\n \n72.7\n \nTotal\n$\n7,579.5\n \n$\n6,649.2\n \nA key credit quality indicator for reinsurance is the A.M.

To mitigate exposure to credit risk for these reinsurers, the Company evaluates the financial condition of the reinsurer and typically holds substantial collateral (in the form of funds withheld, trusts and letters of credit) as security. \nThe effect of reinsurance on premiums earned and benefits incurred was as follows for the periods indicated:\n \n \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n \nLong\nDuration\nShort\nDuration\nTotal\nLong\nDuration\nShort\nDuration\nTotal\nLong\nDuration\nShort\nDuration\nTotal\nDirect earned premiums\n$\n13.4\n \n$\n18,820.1\n \n$\n18,833.5\n \n$\n14.4\n \n$\n18,308.4\n \n$\n18,322.8\n \n$\n19.3\n \n$\n17,475.3\n \n$\n17,494.6\n \nPremiums assumed\n—\n \n178.6\n \n178.6\n \n—\n \n186.4\n \n186.4\n \n—\n \n196.7\n \n196.7\n \nPremiums ceded\n(\n8.0\n)\n(\n9,208.3\n)\n(\n9,216.3\n)\n(\n7.9\n)\n(\n9,113.3\n)\n(\n9,121.2\n)\n(\n12.3\n)\n(\n8,913.7\n)\n(\n8,926.0\n)\nNet earned premiums\n$\n5.4\n \n$\n9,790.4\n \n$\n9,795.8\n \n$\n6.5\n \n$\n9,381.5\n \n$\n9,388.0\n \n$\n7.0\n \n$\n8,758.3\n \n$\n8,765.3\n \nDirect policyholder benefits\n$\n33.7\n \n$\n8,777.1\n \n$\n8,810.8\n \n$\n36.5\n \n$\n7,568.2\n \n$\n7,604.7\n \n$\n55.6\n \n$\n7,616.8\n \n$\n7,672.4\n \nPolicyholder benefits assumed\n0.1\n \n276.9\n \n277.0\n \n—\n \n241.9\n \n241.9\n \n—\n \n163.4\n \n163.4\n \nPolicyholder benefits ceded\n(\n30.3\n)\n(\n6,291.0\n)\n(\n6,321.3\n)\n(\n31.8\n)\n(\n5,293.0\n)\n(\n5,324.8\n)\n(\n51.8\n)\n(\n5,424.2\n)\n(\n5,476.0\n)\nNet policyholder benefits\n$\n3.5\n \n$\n2,763.0\n \n$\n2,766.5\n \n$\n4.7\n \n$\n2,517.1\n \n$\n2,521.8\n \n$\n3.8\n \n$\n2,356.0\n \n$\n2,359.8\n \nThe Company had \nzero\n invested assets held in trusts or by custodians as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, for the benefit of others related to certain reinsurance arrangements.\nThe Company utilizes ceded reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, segment client risk and profit sharing and business divestitures.\nLoss Protection and Capital Management\nAs part of the Company’s overall risk and capacity management strategy, the Company purchases reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by the Company’s various segments, including significant individual or catastrophic claims.\nFor those product lines where there is exposure to losses from catastrophe events, the Company closely monitors and manages its aggregate risk exposure by geographic area. The Company has entered into reinsurance treaties to manage exposure to these types of events.\nSegment Client Risk and Profit Sharing\nThe Global Lifestyle and Global Housing segments write business produced by their clients, such as mobile providers, auto dealers, mortgage lenders and servicers, and financial institutions, and reinsure all or a portion of such business to insurance subsidiaries of some clients. Such arrangements allow significant flexibility in structuring the sharing of risks and profits on the underlying business.\nF-55\n A substantial portion of Global Lifestyle’s and Global Housing’s reinsurance activities are related to agreements to reinsure premiums and risks related to business generated by certain clients to the clients’ own captive insurance companies or to reinsurance subsidiaries in which the clients have an ownership interest. Through these arrangements, the Company’s insurance subsidiaries share some of the premiums and risk related to client-generated business. When the reinsurance companies are not authorized to do business in the state of domicile of the Company’s insurance subsidiary, the Company’s insurance subsidiary generally obtains collateral, such as a trust or a letter of credit, from the reinsurance company or its affiliate in an amount equal to the outstanding reserves to obtain full statutory financial credit in the domiciliary state for the reinsurance. \nBusiness Divestitures\nThe Company has used reinsurance to sell certain businesses in the past because the businesses shared legal entities with operating segments that the Company retained. Assets backing reserves reinsured under these sales are mainly held in trusts or separate accounts. If the reinsurers became insolvent, the Company would be exposed to the risk that the assets in the trusts or the separate accounts, if any, could prove insufficient to support the liabilities that would revert back to the Company. The reinsurance recoverables relating to these divestitures amounted to $\n643.2\n million as of December 31, 2024, of which $\n471.5\n million was attributable to John Hancock, which reinsures the long-term care business and has an A.M. Best financial strength rating of A+ with a stable outlook.\nIn addition, the Company would be responsible for administering these businesses in the event of reinsurer insolvency. The Company does not currently have the administrative systems and capabilities to process these businesses. Accordingly, the Company would need to obtain those capabilities in the event of an insolvency of one or more of the reinsurers of these businesses. The Company might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company was not aware of any regulatory actions taken with respect to the solvency of the insurance subsidiaries of John Hancock and the Company has not been obligated to fulfill any of its obligations. John Hancock has paid its obligations when due and there have been no disputes.\n18. \nDebt \nThe following table shows the principal amount and carrying value of the Company’s outstanding debt, less unamortized discount and issuance costs as applicable, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nPrincipal Amount\nCarrying Value\nPrincipal Amount\nCarrying Value\n6.10\n% Senior Notes due February 2026\n175.0\n \n174.3\n \n175.0\n \n173.7\n \n4.90\n% Senior Notes due March 2028\n300.0\n \n298.6\n \n300.0\n \n298.2\n \n3.70\n% Senior Notes due February 2030\n350.0\n \n348.2\n \n350.0\n \n347.9\n \n2.65\n% Senior Notes due January 2032\n350.0\n \n347.3\n \n350.0\n \n347.0\n \n6.75\n% Senior Notes due February 2034\n275.0\n \n272.8\n \n275.0\n \n272.7\n \n7.00\n% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due March 2048 (1)\n400.0\n \n397.7\n \n400.0\n \n397.0\n \n5.25\n% Subordinated Notes due January 2061\n250.0\n \n244.2\n \n250.0\n \n244.1\n \nTotal Debt\n$\n2,083.1\n \n$\n2,080.6\n \n(1)\nBears a \n7.00\n% annual interest rate to March 2028 and an annual interest rate equal to three-month \nLIBOR\n plus \n4.135\n% thereafter.

At any time prior to March 2028, the Company may redeem the 2048 Subordinated Notes in whole but not in part, within \n90\n days after the occurrence of a tax event, rating agency event or regulatory capital event as defined in the global note representing the 2048 Subordinated Notes, at a redemption price equal to (i) with respect to a rating agency event, \n102\n% of their principal amount and (ii) with respect to a tax event or a regulatory capital event, their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n In addition, so long as no event of default with respect to the 2048 Subordinated Notes and 2061 Subordinated Notes (together, the “Subordinated Notes”) has occurred and is continuing, the Company has the right, on one or more occasions, to defer the payment of interest on the Subordinated Notes for one or more consecutive interest periods for up to five years as described in the global note representing the Subordinated Notes. During a deferral period, interest will continue to accrue on the Subordinated Notes at the then-applicable interest rate. At any time when the Company has given notice of its election to defer interest payments on the Subordinated Notes, the Company generally may not make payments on or redeem or purchase any shares of the Company’s capital stock or any of its debt securities or guarantees that rank upon the Company’s liquidation on a parity with or junior to the Subordinated Notes, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nCredit Facility and Commercial Paper Program\n \nThe Company has a $\n500.0\n million \nfive-year\n senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks arranged by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Credit Facility provides for revolving loans and the issuance of multi-bank, syndicated letters of credit and letters of credit from a sole issuing bank in an aggregate amount of $\n500.0\n million, which may be increased up to $\n700.0\n million. The Credit Facility is available until December 2026, provided the Company is in compliance with all covenants. The Credit Facility has a sublimit for letters of credit issued thereunder of $\n50.0\n million. The proceeds from these loans may be used for the Company’s commercial paper program or for general corporate purposes. \nThe Company made \nno\n borrowings using the Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2024 and \nno\n loans were outstanding as of December 31, 2024. \nF-58\nThe Company’s commercial paper program requires the Company to maintain liquidity facilities either in an available amount equal to any outstanding notes from the program or in an amount sufficient to maintain the ratings assigned to the notes issued from the program. The Company’s commercial paper is rated AMB-1+ by A.M. Best, P-2 by Moody’s and A-2 by S&P. The Company’s subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities. This program is currently backed up by the Credit Facility, of which $\n500.0\n million was available at December 31, 2024.\nThe Company did not use the commercial paper program during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023 and there were \nno\n amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding as of December 31, 2024 or 2023. \nCovenants \nThe Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants including:\n(i)\nMaintenance of a maximum consolidated total debt to capitalization ratio on the last day of any fiscal quarter of not greater than \n0.35\n to 1.0, subject to certain exceptions; and\n(ii)\nMaintenance of a consolidated adjusted net worth in an amount not less than a “Minimum Amount” equal to the sum of (a) $\n4.20\n billion, (b) \n25\n% of consolidated net income (if positive) for each fiscal quarter ending after December 31, 2021 and (c) \n25\n% of the net cash proceeds received from any capital contribution to, or issuance of any capital stock, disqualified capital stock and hybrid securities.\nIn the event of a breach of certain covenants, all obligations under the Credit Facility, including unpaid principal and accrued interest and outstanding letters of credit, may become immediately due and payable. \nInterest Rate Derivatives\nFrom time to time, the Company has entered into derivative transactions to hedge the risk associated with changes in interest rates in anticipation of debt issuances. The Company determined that the derivatives qualified for hedge accounting as effective cash flow hedges and recognized deferred gains upon settlement that were reported through other comprehensive income. The deferred gains are recognized as a reduction in interest expense related to the 2026 Senior Notes, the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2048 Subordinated Notes on an effective yield basis. The amortization of the deferred gain was $\n2.7\n million, $\n2.8\n million and $\n3.1\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remaining total deferred gain as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n8.1\n million and $\n10.8\n million, respectively.\n \n19. \nEquity Transactions\n \nCommon Stock\nChanges in the number of shares of common stock outstanding are as follows for the periods presented: \n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nShares of common stock outstanding, beginning\n51,955,994\n \n52,830,381\n \n55,754,113\n \nVested restricted stock and restricted stock units, net \n(1)\n178,120\n \n170,911\n \n179,434\n \nIssuance related to performance share units \n(1)\n133,136\n \n142,091\n \n147,546\n \nIssuance related to ESPP\n115,019\n \n131,815\n \n96,846\n \nShares of common stock repurchased\n(\n1,548,520\n)\n(\n1,319,204\n)\n(\n3,347,558\n)\nShares of common stock outstanding, ending\n50,833,749\n \n51,955,994\n \n52,830,381\n \n(1)\nVested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units are shown net of shares of common stock retired to cover participant income tax liabilities.\nThe Company is authorized to issue \n800,000,000\n shares of common stock. In addition, \n150,001\n shares of Class B common stock and \n400,001\n shares of Class C common stock are authorized but have not been issued. \nStock Repurchase\nIn November 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the Company to repurchase up to $\n600.0\n million aggregate cost at purchase of its outstanding common stock. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased \n1,548,520\n shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost of $\n299.9\n million, exclusive of commissions, leaving $\n374.5\n million remaining under the November 2023 repurchase authorization at December 31, 2024. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased \n1,319,204\n and \n3,347,558\n shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at a cost, exclusive of commissions, of $\n200.0\n million and $\n567.6\n million, respectively. \nF-59\nThe timing and the amount of future repurchases will depend on market conditions, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and other factors.\n \n20. \nStock Based Compensation \nIn accordance with the guidance on share-based compensation, the Company recognized stock-based compensation costs based on the grant date fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized compensation costs net of a \n5\n% per year estimated forfeiture rate on a pro-rated basis over the remaining vesting period.\nLong-Term Equity Incentive Plan\nUnder the Assurant, Inc. 2017 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the “ALTEIP”), as amended and restated in November 2023, the Company is authorized to issue up to \n1,840,112\n new shares of the Company’s common stock to employees, officers, consultants and non-employee directors. Under the ALTEIP, the Company may grant awards based on shares of its common stock, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock (including performance shares), unrestricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance units (also known as performance share units or “PSUs”) and dividend equivalents. All share-based grants are awarded under the ALTEIP. \nThe Compensation and Talent Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) awards RSUs and PSUs annually. RSUs and PSUs are promises to issue actual shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period or performance period. Under the ALTEIP and the related equity grant policy, the Company’s CEO is authorized by the Board to grant common stock, restricted stock and RSUs to employees other than the Company’s Section 16 officers as CEO Equity Awards and On Cycle ALTEIP Awards. For the CEO Equity Awards, the Compensation Committee recommends total annual funding and the awards are expressed as a dollar amount converted into shares as of each grant date. Restricted stock and RSUs granted under the CEO Equity Awards program may have different vesting periods.\n \nRestricted Stock Units\nThe fair value of RSUs is estimated using the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. The RSUs granted to employees under the ALTEIP are based on salary grade and performance and generally vest one-third each year over a \nthree-year\n period. RSUs receive dividend equivalents in cash during the restricted period and do not have voting rights during the restricted period. RSUs granted to non-employee directors also vest one-third each year over a \nthree-year\n period; however, issuance of vested shares and payment of dividend equivalents is deferred until separation from Board service. \nA summary of the Company’s outstanding RSUs is presented below:\nRestricted Stock Units\nWeighted-Average\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nRestricted stock units outstanding at December 31, 2023\n577,617\n \n$\n129.58\n \nGrants \n(1)\n192,760\n \n181.54\n \nVests \n(2)\n(\n252,910\n)\n134.34\n \nForfeitures and adjustments\n(\n14,513\n)\n148.72\n \nRestricted stock units outstanding at December 31, 2024\n502,954\n \n$\n146.56\n \nRestricted stock units vested, but deferred at December 31, 2024 \n71,179\n \n$\n103.86\n \n(1)\nThe weighted average grant date fair value for RSUs granted in 2023 and 2022 was $\n116.76\n and $\n172.46\n, respectively. \n(2)\nThe total fair value of RSUs vested was $\n45.5\n million, $\n29.9\n million and $\n47.0\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \nThe following table shows a summary of RSU compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022: \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRSU compensation expense\n$\n33.0\n \n$\n31.7\n \n$\n34.9\n \nIncome tax benefit\n(\n6.1\n)\n(\n6.0\n)\n(\n6.4\n)\nRSU compensation expense, net of tax\n$\n26.9\n \n$\n25.7\n \n$\n28.5\n \nF-60\nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $\n19.1\n million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n0.91\n years. \nPerformance Share Units\nThe number of shares of common stock a participant will receive upon vesting of a PSU award is contingent upon the Company’s performance with respect to selected metrics, as identified below. The payout levels can vary between \n0\n% and \n200\n% (maximum) of the target (\n100\n%) ALTEIP award amount, based on the Company’s level of performance against the selected metrics. PSUs accrue dividend equivalents during the performance period based on a target payout and will be paid in cash at the end of the performance period based on the actual number of shares issued.\nThe Compensation Committee has established \ntwo\n equally weighted performance measures for PSU awards: \n•\nTotal shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 Index (“market condition”), defined as appreciation in the Company’s common stock plus dividend yield to stockholders and will be measured by the performance of the Company relative to the S&P 500 Index over the \nthree-year\n performance period.\n•\nAdjusted earnings per diluted common share, excluding reportable catastrophes (“performance condition”) is a Company-specific profitability metric and is defined as the Company’s adjusted earnings, excluding reportable catastrophes, divided by the fully diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. This metric is an absolute metric that is measured against a \nthree-year\n cumulative target established by the Compensation Committee at the award date and is not tied to the performance of peer companies. Prior to 2023, net operating income per diluted common share, excluding reportable catastrophes, was used as the company specific profitability metric.\nA summary of the Company’s outstanding PSUs is presented below: \nPerformance\nShare Units\nWeighted-Average\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nPerformance share units outstanding at December 31, 2023\n598,755\n \n$\n151.63\n \nGrants \n(1)\n188,407\n \n207.00\n \nVests \n(2)\n(\n220,055\n)\n147.85\n \nPerformance adjustment \n(3)\n28,890\n \n146.19\n \nForfeitures and adjustments\n(\n10,491\n)\n165.01\n \nPerformance share units outstanding at December 31, 2024\n585,506\n \n$\n170.44\n \n(1)\nThe weighted average grant date fair value for PSUs granted in 2023 and 2022 was $\n114.91\n and $\n217.33\n, respectively.\n(2)\nThe total fair value of PSUs vested was $\n39.8\n million, $\n25.8\n million and $\n42.8\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n(3)\nRepresents the change in PSUs issued based upon the attainment of performance goals established by the Company.\n \nPSU grants above represent initial target awards and do not reflect potential increases or decreases resulting from the Company’s level of performance against the selected metrics to be determined at the end of the prospective performance period. \nThe fair value of the performance condition was estimated using the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. The fair value of the market condition was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which utilizes multiple variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award. Expected volatilities were based on the historical prices of the Company’s common stock and peer group, the expected term was assumed to equal the average of the vesting period of the PSUs and the risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n \nFor awards granted during the years ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nExpected volatility\n25.76\n \n%\n26.84\n \n%\n33.82\n \n%\nExpected term (years)\n2.79\n2.80\n2.80\nRisk free interest rate\n4.44\n \n%\n3.93\n \n%\n2.09\n \n%\nF-61\nThe following table shows a summary of PSU compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022: \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPSU compensation expense\n$\n45.4\n \n$\n40.3\n \n$\n24.8\n \nIncome tax benefit\n(\n6.0\n)\n(\n5.8\n)\n(\n3.7\n)\nPSU compensation expense, net of tax\n$\n39.4\n \n$\n34.5\n \n$\n21.1\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $\n37.6\n million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding PSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n0.85\n years. \nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), the Company is authorized to issue up to \n5,000,000\n new shares of common stock to employees who are participants in the ESPP. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute, through payroll deductions, portions of their after-tax compensation in each offering period toward the purchase of shares of the Company’s common stock. There are \ntwo\n offering periods during the year (January 1 through June 30 and July 1 through December 31) and shares of common stock are purchased at the end of each offering period at \n90\n% of the lower of the closing price of the common stock on the first or last day of the offering period. Participants must be employed on the last trading day of the offering period in order to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP. The maximum number of shares of common stock that can be purchased is \n5,000\n per employee. Participants’ contributions are limited to a maximum contribution of $\n7.5\n thousand per offering period, or $\n15.0\n thousand per year.\nThe ESPP is offered to individuals who are scheduled to work a certain number of hours per week, have been continuously employed for at least \nsix months\n by the start of the offering period, are not temporary employees (classified as temporary and employed less than \n12\n months) and have not been on a leave of absence for more than \n90\n days immediately preceding the offering period. \nIn January 2025, the Company issued \n50,763\n shares of common stock at a discounted price of $\n150.20\n for the offering period of July 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. In January 2024, the Company issued \n65,049\n shares of common stock at a discounted price of $\n113.26\n for the offering period of July 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. \nIn July 2024, the Company issued \n49,969\n shares of common stock to employees at a discounted price of $\n149.63\n for the offering period of January 1, 2024 through June 30, 2024. In July 2023, the Company issued \n66,306\n shares of common stock to employees at a discounted price of $\n113.15\n for the offering period of January 1, 2023 through June 30, 2023. \nThe compensation expense recorded related to the ESPP was $\n2.8\n million, $\n3.1\n million and $\n3.0\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The related income tax benefit for disqualified disposition was $\n0.2\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and \n0.1\n million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. \nThe fair value of each award under the ESPP was estimated at the beginning of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and assumptions in the table below. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s common stock and the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the current annualized dividend and common stock price as of the grant date.\n \nFor awards issued during the years ended December 31,\n \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nExpected volatility\n19.60\n - \n23.95\n%\n28.57\n - \n31.63\n%\n20.96\n - \n25.05\n%\nRisk free interest rates\n5.24\n - \n5.37\n%\n4.77\n - \n5.53\n%\n0.22\n - \n2.52\n%\nDividend yield\n1.68\n - \n1.71\n%\n2.18\n - \n2.20\n%\n1.54\n - \n1.73\n%\nExpected term (years)\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\nNon-Stock Based Incentive Plans\nDeferred Compensation\nThe Company’s deferred compensation programs consist of the AIP, the ASIC and the ADC. The AIP and the ASIC provided key employees the ability to exchange a portion of their compensation for options to purchase certain third-party mutual funds. The AIP and the ASIC were frozen in December 2004 and no additional contributions can be made to either the AIP or the ASIC. Effective March 1, 2005 and amended and restated on January 1, 2025, the ADC Plan was established in \nF-62\norder to comply with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”) and Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “IRC”). The ADC provides key employees the ability to defer a portion of their eligible compensation to be notionally invested in a variety of mutual funds.

Prescribed SAP includes the Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) as well as state laws, regulations and administrative rules.\nThe principal differences between SAP and GAAP are: (1) policy acquisition costs are expensed as incurred under SAP, but are deferred and amortized under GAAP; (2) VOBA is not capitalized under SAP but is under GAAP; (3) the classification and carrying amounts of investments in certain securities are different under SAP than under GAAP; (4) the criteria for providing asset valuation allowances, and the methodologies used to determine the amounts thereof, are different under SAP than under GAAP; (5) the timing of establishing certain reserves, and the methodologies used to determine the amounts thereof, are different under SAP than under GAAP; (6) certain assets are not admitted for purposes of determining surplus under SAP; (7) methodologies used to determine the amounts of deferred taxes, intangible assets and goodwill are different under SAP than under GAAP; and (8) the criteria for obtaining reinsurance accounting treatment is different under SAP than under GAAP, and SAP allows net presentation of insurance reserves and reinsurance recoverables.\nF-64\nThe combined statutory net income, excluding intercompany dividends and surplus note interest, and capital and surplus of the Company’s U.S. domiciled statutory insurance subsidiaries is as follows:\n \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nProperty and casualty companies\n$\n546.0\n \n$\n529.4\n \n$\n283.5\n \nLife and health companies\n22.2\n \n13.7\n \n20.0\n \nTotal statutory net income\n$\n568.2\n \n$\n543.1\n \n$\n303.5\n \n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nProperty and casualty companies\n$\n1,642.8\n \n$\n1,461.4\n \nLife and health companies\n85.5\n \n87.6\n \nTotal statutory capital and surplus\n$\n1,728.3\n \n$\n1,549.0\n \nThe Company also has non-insurance subsidiaries and foreign insurance subsidiaries that are not subject to SAP. The statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus amounts presented above do not include non-insurance subsidiaries and foreign insurance subsidiaries in accordance with SAP.\nInsurance enterprises are required by state insurance departments to adhere to minimum risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements developed by the NAIC. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries expect to exceed minimum RBC requirements as of December 31, 2024. In addition, all of our rated insurance subsidiaries currently maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of A.\nThe payment of dividends to the Company by any of the Company’s regulated U.S domiciled insurance subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e., extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by a formula, which varies by jurisdiction. The formula for the majority of the jurisdictions in which the Company’s subsidiaries are domiciled is based on the prior year’s statutory net income or \n10\n% of the statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year. Some jurisdictions limit ordinary dividends to the greater of these two amounts, others limit them to the lesser of these two amounts and some jurisdictions exclude prior year realized capital gains from prior year net income in determining ordinary dividend capacity. Some jurisdictions have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by the Company’s insurance subsidiaries to the Company (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, the regulators may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. Based on the dividend restrictions under applicable laws and regulations, the maximum amount of dividends that the Company’s U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay to the Company in 2025 without regulatory approval is approximately $\n524.2\n million. No assurance can be given that there will not be further regulatory actions restricting the ability of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends.\n23. \nRetirement and Other Employee Benefits\nDefined Benefit Plans \nThe Company and its subsidiaries participate in a non-contributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (“Assurant Pension Plan”) covering substantially all employees. The Assurant Pension Plan is considered “qualified” because it meets the requirements of IRC Section 401(a) (“IRC 401(a)”) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). The Assurant Pension Plan is a pension equity plan with a grandfathered final average earnings plan for a certain group of employees. Benefits are based on certain years of service and the employee’s compensation during certain such years of service. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute amounts to the Assurant Pension Plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements in ERISA, plus such additional amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate from time to time up to the maximum permitted. The funding policy considers several factors to determine such additional amounts, including items such as the amount of service cost plus \n15\n% of the Assurant Pension Plan deficit and the capital position of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2024, there were \nno\n contributions to the Assurant Pension Plan. Due to the Assurant Pension Plan’s current funding status, \nno\n contributions to the Assurant Pension Plan are expected during the year ending December 31, 2025. Assurant Pension Plan assets are maintained in a separate trust. Assurant Pension Plan assets and benefit obligations are measured as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company also has various non-contributory, non-qualified supplemental plans covering certain employees including the Assurant Executive Pension Plan and the Assurant Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). Since these \nF-65\nplans are “non-qualified” they are not subject to the requirements of IRC 401(a) and ERISA. As such, the Company is not required, and does not, fund these plans. The qualified and non-qualified plans are referred to as “Pension Benefits” unless otherwise noted. The Company has the right to modify or terminate these benefits; however, the Company will not be relieved of its obligation to plan participants for their vested benefits. \nIn addition, the Company provides certain health care benefits (“Retirement Health Benefits”) and life benefits for retired employees and their dependents. On July 1, 2011, the Company terminated certain Retirement Health Benefits for employees who did not qualify for “grandfathered” status and no longer offers these benefits to new hires. The Company contribution, plan design and other terms of the remaining benefits did not change for those grandfathered employees. The Company has the right to modify or terminate these benefits. \nEffective January 1, 2014, the Pension Benefits plans were closed to new hires. Effective March 1, 2016, the Pension Benefits, Retirement Health Benefits and life benefits (together, the “Plans”) were amended such that no additional benefits will be earned after February 29, 2016. \nIn February 2020, the Company amended the Retirement Health Benefits to terminate effective December 31, 2024 (the “Termination Date”). Benefits will be paid through the Termination Date. The Retirement Health Benefits obligations were remeasured using a discount rate of \n1.55\n%, selected based on a cash flow analysis using a bond yield curve as of February 29, 2020, and the fair market value of the Retirement Health Benefits assets as of February 29, 2020. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction to the Retirement Health Benefits obligations of $\n65.6\n million and a corresponding prior service credit in AOCI. This prior service credit has been fully amortized in the net periodic benefit cost as of December 31, 2024.  \nThe following table presents information on the Plans for the periods indicated:\n \nPension Benefits\nRetirement Health Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nChange in projected benefit obligation\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of year\n$\n(\n599.8\n)\n$\n(\n598.5\n)\n$\n(\n4.9\n)\n$\n(\n9.9\n)\nInterest cost\n(\n28.9\n)\n(\n30.5\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\n(\n0.4\n)\nActuarial gain\n49.5\n \n(\n15.8\n)\n(\n0.5\n)\n0.3\n \nBenefits paid\n35.1\n \n45.0\n \n4.7\n \n5.1\n \nProjected benefit obligation at end of year\n$\n(\n544.1\n)\n$\n(\n599.8\n)\n$\n(\n0.9\n)\n$\n(\n4.9\n)\nChange in plan assets\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n$\n636.7\n \n$\n641.8\n \n$\n26.0\n \n$\n29.4\n \nActual return on plan assets\n11.2\n \n35.9\n \n0.3\n \n1.5\n \nEmployer contributions\n4.7\n \n5.4\n \n0.2\n \n0.2\n \nSettlements\n(\n34.3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nBenefits paid (including administrative expenses)\n(\n37.0\n)\n(\n46.4\n)\n(\n4.7\n)\n(\n5.1\n)\nNet transfer in/(out) (including effect of any business combinations/divestitures)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n21.8\n)\n—\n \nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n$\n581.3\n \n$\n636.7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n26.0\n \nFunded status at end of year\n$\n37.2\n \n$\n36.9\n \n$\n(\n0.9\n)\n$\n21.1\n \nIn accordance with the guidance on retirement benefits, the Company aggregates the results of the qualified and non-qualified plans as “Pension Benefits” and is required to disclose the aggregate projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, if the obligations within those plans exceed plan assets. \nF-66\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of plan assets, projected benefit obligation, funded status at end of year and the accumulated benefit obligation of Pension Benefits were as follows:\n \nQualified Pension Benefits\nUnfunded Nonqualified \nPension Benefits\nTotal Pension Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nFair value of plan assets\n$\n581.3\n \n$\n636.7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n581.3\n \n$\n636.7\n \nProjected benefit obligation\n(\n497.2\n)\n(\n550.1\n)\n(\n46.9\n)\n(\n49.7\n)\n(\n544.1\n)\n(\n599.8\n)\nFunded status at end of year\n$\n84.1\n \n$\n86.6\n \n$\n(\n46.9\n)\n$\n(\n49.7\n)\n$\n37.2\n \n$\n36.9\n \nAccumulated benefit obligation\n$\n497.2\n \n$\n550.1\n \n$\n46.9\n \n$\n49.7\n \n$\n544.1\n \n$\n599.8\n \n  \nAmounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets consist of:\n \nPension Benefits\nRetirement Health Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nAssets\n$\n84.1\n \n$\n86.6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n21.1\n \nLiabilities\n$\n(\n46.9\n)\n$\n(\n49.7\n)\n$\n(\n0.9\n)\n$\n—\n \n \nAmounts recognized in AOCI consist of: \n \nPension Benefits\nRetirement Health Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet (loss) gain \n$\n(\n162.7\n)\n$\n(\n158.5\n)\n$\n(\n137.5\n)\n$\n(\n3.3\n)\n$\n(\n1.8\n)\n$\n(\n2.1\n)\nPrior service (cost) credit\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n0.4\n)\n—\n \n13.4\n \n27.2\n \n$\n(\n163.0\n)\n$\n(\n158.8\n)\n$\n(\n137.9\n)\n$\n(\n3.3\n)\n$\n11.6\n \n$\n25.1\n \nComponents of net periodic benefit cost, recorded in underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, and other amounts recognized in AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows: \n \nPension Benefits\nRetirement Health Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet periodic benefit cost\nInterest cost\n$\n28.9\n \n$\n30.5\n \n$\n18.0\n \n$\n0.2\n \n$\n0.4\n \n$\n0.1\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n40.1\n)\n(\n40.9\n)\n(\n27.5\n)\n(\n1.3\n)\n(\n1.5\n)\n(\n1.4\n)\nAmortization of prior service credit (cost)\n—\n \n—\n \n0.1\n \n(\n13.6\n)\n(\n13.6\n)\n(\n13.6\n)\nAmortization of net loss (gain)\n1.2\n \n1.0\n \n5.1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.7\n)\nCurtailment/settlement loss\n10.2\n \n0.2\n \n1.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nNet periodic benefit cost\n$\n0.2\n \n$\n(\n9.2\n)\n$\n(\n2.4\n)\n$\n(\n14.7\n)\n$\n(\n14.7\n)\n$\n(\n15.6\n)\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income\nNet (gain) loss\n15.5\n \n22.2\n \n(\n18.6\n)\n1.5\n \n(\n0.2\n)\n7.6\n \nAmortization of prior service (cost) credit\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.1\n)\n13.6\n \n13.6\n \n13.6\n \nAmortization of net (loss) gain\n(\n11.3\n)\n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n7.0\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n0.7\n \nTotal recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income\n$\n4.2\n \n$\n21.0\n \n$\n(\n25.7\n)\n$\n15.1\n \n$\n13.4\n \n$\n21.9\n \nTotal recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive (loss) income\n$\n4.4\n \n$\n11.8\n \n$\n(\n28.1\n)\n$\n0.4\n \n$\n(\n1.3\n)\n$\n6.3\n \nThe Company uses a \nfive-year\n averaging method to determine the market-related value of Pension Benefits plan assets, which is used to calculate the expected return of plan assets component of the Plans’ expense. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses that result from actual returns which differ from the Company’s expected long-term rate of return on assets \nF-67\nassumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis over a \nfive-year\n period. The difference between actual as compared to expected asset returns for the Plans will be fully reflected in the market-related value of plan assets over the next \nfive years\n using the methodology described above. Other post-employment benefit assets under the Retirement Health Benefits are valued at fair value. \nDetermination of the projected benefit obligation was based on the following weighted-average assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022: \n \nQualified Pension Benefits\nUnfunded Nonqualified Pension Benefits\nRetirement Health Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n5.60\n \n%\n5.14\n \n%\n5.42\n \n%\n5.51\n \n%\n5.11\n \n%\n5.42\n \n%\n5.69\n \n%\n5.63\n \n%\n5.36\n \n%\nDetermination of the net periodic benefit cost was based on the following weighted-average assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022: \n \nQualified Pension Benefits\nUnfunded Nonqualified Pension Benefits\nRetirement Health Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rates:\nEffective discount rate for benefit obligations\n5.14\n \n%\n5.42\n \n%\n2.79\n \n%\n5.11\n \n%\n5.42\n \n%\n2.68\n \n%\n5.24\n \n%\n5.36\n \n%\n1.08\n \n%\nEffective rate for interest on benefit obligations\n5.07\n \n%\n5.34\n \n%\n2.30\n \n%\n5.04\n \n%\n5.33\n \n%\n2.05\n \n%\n5.86\n \n%\n5.37\n \n%\n1.02\n \n%\nExpected long-term return on plan assets\n5.70\n \n%\n5.70\n \n%\n3.65\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n5.70\n \n%\n5.70\n \n%\n3.65\n \n%\nThe selection of the Company’s discount rate assumption reflects the rate at which the Plans’ obligations could be effectively settled at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The methodology for selecting the discount rate was to match each Plan’s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero-coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. The yield curve utilized in the cash flow analysis was comprised of \n341\n bonds rated AA by either Moody’s or S&P’s with maturities between \nzero\n and \n30\n years. The discount rate for each Plan is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows. The Company utilizes a split rate approach for purposes of determining the benefit obligations and service cost as well as a spot rate approach for the calculation of interest on these items in the determination of the net periodic benefit cost.  \nTo develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the targeted asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumptions for the portfolio. The Company believes the current assumption reflects the projected return on the invested assets, given the current market conditions and the modified portfolio structure. Actual return (loss) on Plan assets was \n1.7\n%, \n5.6\n% and (\n16.9\n)% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively. \nF-68\nThe assumed health care cost trend rates used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost were as follows: \n \nRetirement Health Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year \n(1)\n:\nPre-65 Non-reimbursement Plan\nN/A\n5.6\n%\n5.4\n%\nPost-65 Non-reimbursement Plan (Medical)\nN/A\n4.0\n%\n4.2\n%\nPost-65 Non-reimbursement Plan (Rx)\nN/A\n7.0\n%\n6.6\n%\nPre-65 Reimbursement Plan\nN/A\n5.5\n%\n5.4\n%\nPost-65 Reimbursement Plan\nN/A\n5.5\n%\n5.4\n%\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate) \n(1)\nN/A\n4.0\n%\n4.0\n%\nYear that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate \n(1)\nPre-65 Non-reimbursement Plan\nN/A\n2045\n2045\nPost-65 Non-reimbursement Plan (Medical & Rx)\nN/A\n2045\n2045\nPre-65 Reimbursement Plan\nN/A\n2045\n2045\nPost-65 Reimbursement Plan\nN/A\n2045\n2045\n(1)\nThe Retirement Health Benefits Plan terminated effective December 31, 2024. Since the plan has terminated, there are no costs to bring forward to the following year so none of the trend rates are applicable for 2024.\n \nThe assets of the Plans are managed to maximize their long-term pre-tax investment return, subject to the following dual constraints: minimization of required contributions and maintenance of solvency requirements. It is anticipated that periodic contributions to the Plans will, for the foreseeable future, be sufficient to meet benefit payments thus allowing the balance to be managed according to a long-term approach. The Benefit Plans Investment Committee (“BPIC”) for the Plans meets on a quarterly basis and reviews the re-balancing of existing fund assets and the asset allocation of new fund contributions. \nThe goal of the Company’s asset strategy is to ensure that the growth in the value of the Plans’ assets over the long-term, both in real and nominal terms, manages (controls) risk exposure. Risk is managed by investing in a broad range of asset classes, and within those asset classes, a broad range of individual securities. Diversification by asset classes stabilizes total results over short-term time periods. Each asset class is externally managed by outside investment managers appointed by the BPIC. Derivatives may be used consistent with the Plans’ investment objectives established by the BPIC. All securities must be U.S. Dollar denominated. \nThe BPIC oversees the investment of the Plans’ assets and periodically reviews the investment strategies, strategic asset allocation, liabilities and portfolio structure of the assets. After a 2017 review and considering the funded status of the Assurant Pension Plan, the BPIC transitioned plan assets to a new target asset allocation consisting of \n80\n% fixed income, \n10\n% real estate, \n5\n% hedge funds and \n5\n% equities. \nThe assets of the Plans are primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. Interest rate risk is hedged by aligning the duration of the fixed maturity securities with the duration of the liabilities. Specifically, interest rate swaps can be used if needed to synthetically extend the duration of fixed maturity securities to match the duration of the liabilities, as measured on a projected benefit obligation basis. In addition, the Plans’ fixed income securities have exposure to credit risk. In order to adequately diversify and limit exposure to credit risk, the BPIC established parameters which include a limit on the asset types that managers are permitted to purchase, maximum exposure limits by sector and by individual issuer (based on asset quality) and minimum required ratings on individual securities. As of December 31, 2024, \n87\n% of plan assets were invested in fixed maturity securities and \n18\n%, \n17\n% and \n11\n% of those securities were concentrated in the energy and power, finance and real estate, and communication industries, respectively, with no exposure to any single creditor in excess of \n4\n%, \n5\n% and \n13\n% of those industries, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, \n5\n% of plan assets were invested in equity securities and \n100\n% of the Plans’ equity securities were invested in a mutual fund that attempts to replicate the return of the S&P 500 Index by investing its assets in large capitalization stocks that are included in the S&P 500 Index using a weighting similar to the S&P 500 Index. The remainder of the assets are invested in real estate and other alternative assets. \nF-69\nThe fair value hierarchy for the Company’s qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets at December 31, 2024 by asset category, is as follows: \nQualified Pension Benefits\nDecember 31, 2024\nFinancial Assets\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nCash equivalents:\nShort-term investment funds\n$\n7.8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7.8\n \nEquity securities:\nMutual funds - U.S. listed large cap\n29.2\n \n29.2\n \n—\n \nFixed maturity securities:\nU.S. & foreign government and government agencies and authorities\n144.0\n \n—\n \n144.0\n \nCorporate - U.S. & foreign investment grade\n334.7\n \n—\n \n334.7\n \nCorporate - U.S. & foreign high yield\n10.9\n \n—\n \n10.9\n \nMutual funds - U.S. investment grade\n14.4\n \n14.4\n \n—\n \nOther investments measured at net asset value \n(1)\n106.6\n \n— \n— \nTotal financial assets \n(2)\n$\n647.6\n \n$\n43.6\n \n$\n497.4\n \n(1)\nIn accordance with fair value measurements and disclosures guidance, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

The pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for the Company’s Level 2 securities using proprietary valuation models based on techniques such as matrix pricing which include observable market inputs. Observable market inputs for Level 1 and Level 2 securities are consistent with the observable market inputs described in Note 9.  \nThe Company obtains one price for each investment. A quarterly analysis is performed to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of their fair value. This process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by benefits, investment and accounting professionals. Examples of procedures performed include initial and on-going review of pricing service methodologies, review of pricing statistics and trends, and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different appropriate price sources for reasonableness. Following this analysis, the Company uses the best estimate of fair value based upon all available inputs. The pricing service provides information regarding their pricing procedures so that the Company can properly categorize the Plans’ financial assets in the fair value hierarchy. \nF-71\nThe following pension benefits are expected to be paid over the next ten-year period:\nPension\nBenefits\nRetirement\nHealth\nBenefits\n2025\n$\n49.6\n \n$\n0.1\n \n2026\n49.7\n \n0.1\n \n2027\n48.2\n \n0.1\n \n2028\n48.1\n \n—\n \n2029\n48.1\n \n—\n \n2030 - 2034\n215.3\n \n0.3\n \nTotal\n$\n459.0\n \n$\n0.6\n \nDefined Contribution Plan\nThe Company and its subsidiaries participate in a defined contribution plan covering substantially all employees. The defined contribution plan provides benefits payable to participants on retirement or disability and to beneficiaries of participants in the event of the participant’s death. The amounts expensed by the Company related to this plan were $\n43.5\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $\n44.1\n million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n \n24. \nEarnings Per Common Share  \nThe following table presents net income, the weighted average common shares used in calculating basic EPS and those used in calculating diluted EPS for each period presented below. Diluted EPS reflects the incremental common shares from common shares issuable upon vesting of PSUs and ESPP using the treasury stock method. Refer to Notes 19 and 20 for further information regarding potential common stock issuances. The outstanding RSUs have non-forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents and are therefore included in calculating basic and diluted EPS under the two-class method. \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumerator\nNet income\n$\n760.2\n \n$\n642.5\n \n$\n276.6\n \nLess: Common stock dividends paid\n(\n155.9\n)\n(\n152.3\n)\n(\n150.2\n)\nUndistributed earnings\n$\n604.3\n \n$\n490.2\n \n$\n126.4\n \nDenominator\nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in basic per common share calculations\n52,231,729\n \n53,455,139\n \n54,371,531\n \nIncremental common shares from:\nPSUs\n324,484\n \n294,808\n \n348,036\n \nESPP\n24,889\n \n33,122\n \n62,961\n \nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in diluted per common share calculations\n52,581,102\n \n53,783,069\n \n54,782,528\n \nEarnings per common share – Basic\nDistributed earnings\n$\n2.99\n \n$\n2.85\n \n$\n2.76\n \nUndistributed earnings\n11.56\n \n9.17\n \n2.33\n \nNet income\n$\n14.55\n \n$\n12.02\n \n$\n5.09\n \nEarnings per common share – Diluted\nDistributed earnings\n$\n2.97\n \n$\n2.83\n \n$\n2.74\n \nUndistributed earnings\n11.49\n \n9.12\n \n2.31\n \nNet income\n$\n14.46\n \n$\n11.95\n \n$\n5.05\n \nAverage PSUs totaling \n48,859\n, \n56,456\n and \n52,982\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were outstanding but were anti-dilutive and thus not included in the computation of diluted EPS under the treasury stock method.\n \nF-72\n25. \nRestructuring and Related Impairment Charges\nIn December 2022, the Company finalized its plan to realize greater efficiencies by continuing to simplify its business portfolio and leverage its global footprint to reduce costs. This included realigning its organizational structure and talent to support its business strategy (the “transformational plan”). The Company also accelerated its ongoing real estate consolidation to support work-from-home arrangements given its increasingly hybrid workforce (the “return to work strategy”). \nIn September 2023, the Company amended and extended the December 2022 plan to include additional actions within the initiatives described above, including further consolidation of its real estate portfolio and additional changes to its organizational structure. The Company now expects to complete these actions in 2025.\nThe following table summarizes the costs by major type that are recorded in \nunderwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses\n in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative costs incurred as of December 31, 2024 and the estimated total costs incurred.

Certain facility leases contain escalation clauses based on increases in the lessors’ operating expenses. \nF-73\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the lease liability was $\n62.4\n million and $\n35.3\n million, respectively, included in \naccounts payable and other liabilities\n in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the right-of-use asset was $\n54.1\n million and $\n23.0\n million, respectively, included in \nother assets\n in the consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the operating lease cost recognized for leases with terms in excess of 12 months was $\n23.2\n million, $\n19.0\n million and $\n18.1\n million respectively, and related cash outflows reducing the lease liability were $\n23.4\n million, $\n19.4\n million and $\n19.3\n million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate was \n5.2\n years and \n5.6\n%, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate was \n5.0\n years and \n5.0\n%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the short-term lease cost recognized for leases with terms of 12 months or less was $\n1.1\n million, $\n1.1\n million and $\n1.5\n million, respectively. \nAt December 31, 2024, the lease liability by maturity is as follows:\n2025\n$\n17.7\n \n2026\n16.2\n \n2027\n12.6\n \n2028\n9.8\n \n2029\n8.3\n \nThereafter\n7.1\n \nTotal future lease payments\n71.7\n \nLess: Imputed interest\n(\n9.3\n)\nTotal lease liability\n$\n62.4\n \nLetters of Credit\nIn the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued for various purposes. These letters of credit are supported by commitments under which the Company is required to indemnify the financial institution issuing the letter of credit if the letter of credit is drawn. The Company had $\n1.8\n million and $\n2.9\n million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nLegal and Regulatory Matters\nThe Company is involved in a variety of litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings relating to its current and past business operations and, from time to time, it may become involved in other such actions. The Company continues to defend itself vigorously in these proceedings. The Company has participated and may participate in settlements on terms that the Company considers reasonable.\nThe Company has established an accrued liability for certain legal and regulatory proceedings. The possible loss or range of loss resulting from such litigation and regulatory proceedings, if any, in excess of the amounts accrued is inherently unpredictable and uncertain. Consequently, no reasonable estimate can be made of any possible loss or range of loss in excess of the accrual. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of any pending legal or regulatory proceeding, or the potential losses, fines, penalties or equitable relief, if any, that may result, it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows for an individual reporting period. However, on the basis of currently available information, management does not believe that the pending matters are likely to have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the Company’s financial condition.\n \n27. \nSubsequent Events\nThe California Wildfires began in January 2025, causing significant damage throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area and surrounding regions. At the time of this filing, the claims process continues and our current view is that reportable catastrophes from the California Wildfires are expected to approach or slightly exceed our catastrophe reinsurance program per event retention of $\n150\n million.  There is inherent variability in our estimates of early loss projections and claims severity, and therefore the estimate may change as additional information emerges.\n \nF-74\nAssurant,
