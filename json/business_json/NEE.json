Business \n–\n NEER for a description of principal properties.\nCharacter of Ownership\nSubstantially all of FPL's properties are subject to the lien of FPL's mortgage, which secures most long-term debt securities issued by FPL. The majority of FPL's real property is held in fee and is free from other encumbrances, subject to minor exceptions which are not of a nature as to substantially impair the usefulness to FPL of such properties. Some of FPL's electric lines are located on parcels of land which are not owned in fee by FPL but are covered by necessary consents of governmental authorities or rights obtained from owners of private property. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment have ownership interests in entities that own generation facilities, pipeline facilities and transmission assets and a number of those facilities and assets are encumbered by liens securing various financings. Additionally, the majority of NEER's generation facilities, pipeline facilities and transmission lines are located on land under easement, rights-of-way or leased from owners of private property or governmental entities.

Legal Proceedings\nSee Note 15 – Legal Proceedings.\nWith regard to environmental proceedings to which a governmental authority is a party, NEE's and FPL's policy is to disclose any such proceeding if it is reasonably expected to result in monetary sanctions of greater than or equal to $1 million.\nItem 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable\nPART II\nItem 5.  Market for Registrants' Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nCommon Stock Data.\n \nAll of FPL's common stock is owned by NEE. NEE's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"NEE.\" As of January 31, 2025, there were 13,160 holders of record of NEE's common stock. The amount and timing of dividends payable on NEE's common stock are within the sole discretion of NEE's Board of Directors. The Board of Directors reviews the dividend rate at least annually (generally in February) to determine its appropriateness in light of NEE's financial position and results of operations, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and FPL in particular, competitive conditions, change in business mix and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. In February 2025, NEE announced that it would increase its quarterly dividend on its common stock from $0.515 per share to $0.5665 per share.\n35\nTable of Content\ns\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities. \nInformation regarding purchases made by NEE of its common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:\nPeriod\nTotal\nNumber\nof Shares\nPurchased\n(a)\nAverage\nPrice Paid\nPer Share\nTotal Number of Shares\nPurchased as Part of a\nPublicly Announced Program\nMaximum Number of\nShares that May Yet be\nPurchased Under the\nProgram\n(b)\n10/1/24 – 10/31/24\n— \n$\n— \n—\n180,000,000\n11/1/24 – 11/30/24\n4,053\n$\n76.35 \n—\n180,000,000\n12/1/24 – 12/31/24\n—\n$\n— \n—\n180,000,000\nTotal\n4,053\n$\n76.35 \n—\n \n______________________\n(a)\nIncludes shares of common stock withheld from employees to pay certain withholding taxes upon the vesting of stock awards granted to such employees under the NextEra Energy, Inc. 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan.\n(b)\nIn May 2017, NEE's Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to 45 million shares of common stock (180 million shares after giving effect to the four-for-one stock split of NEE common stock effective October 26, 2020) over an unspecified period. \nItem 6.  Reserved \n36\nTable of Content\ns\nItem 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nNEE’s operating performance is driven primarily by the operations of its two principal businesses, FPL, which serves more than six million customer accounts in Florida and is one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., and NEER, which together with affiliated entities is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun based on 2024 MWh produced on a net generation basis, \nas well as a world leader in battery storage capacity\n. The table below presents net income (loss)\n attributable to NEE and\n earnings (loss) per s\nhare attributable to NEE, assuming dilution, by reportable segment, FPL and NEER. \nCorporate and Other is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as other income and expense items, including interest expense, and eliminating entries, and may include the net effect of rounding.\n \nSee Note 16 for additional segment information. \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein and all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year. \nNet Income (Loss) Attributable\nto NEE\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to NEE, \nAssuming Dilution\nYears Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(millions)\nFPL\n$\n4,543\n \n$\n4,552 \n$\n3,701 \n$\n2.21\n \n$\n2.24 \n$\n1.87 \nNEER\n(a)\n2,299\n \n3,558 \n285 \n1.12\n \n1.75 \n0.14 \nCorporate and Other\n104\n \n(800)\n161 \n0.04\n \n(0.39)\n0.09 \nNEE\n$\n6,946\n \n$\n7,310 \n$\n4,147 \n$\n3.37\n \n$\n3.60 \n$\n2.10 \n______________________\n(a)    NEER’s results reflect an allocation of interest expense from NEECH to NextEra Energy Resources based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries.\nFor the five years ended December 31, 2024, NEE delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 33.2%, compared to the S&P 500’s 97.0% return, the S&P 500 Utilities' 37.7% return and the Dow Jones U.S. Electricity's 40.0% return. The historical stock performance of NEE's common stock shown in the performance graph below is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.\n37\nTable of Content\ns\nAdjusted Earnings\nNEE prepares its financial statements under GAAP. However, management also uses earnings adjusted for certain items (adjusted earnings), a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the Board of Directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under NEE’s employee incentive compensation plans. NEE also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors. \nNEE\n’s management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NEE's fundamental earnings power. Although these amounts are properly reflected in the determination of net income under GAAP, management believes that the amount and/or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing. Adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income, as prepared under GAAP.\nThe following table provides details of the after-tax adjustments to net income considered in computing NEE's adjusted earnings discussed above.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(millions)\nNet gains (losses) associated with non-qualifying hedge activity\n(a)\n$\n666\n \n$\n1,497 \n$\n(696)\nDifferential membership interests-related \n–\n NEER\n$\n(5)\n$\n(49)\n$\n(87)\nXPLR investment gains, net \n–\n NEER\n(b)\n$\n(852)\n$\n(963)\n$\n186 \nGain on disposal of a business\n(c)\n$\n—\n \n$\n306 \n$\n— \nChange in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds and OTTI, net \n–\n NEER\n$\n74\n \n$\n116 \n$\n(324)\nImpairment charges related to investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline \n–\n NEER\n(d)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(38)\n$\n(674)\n______________________\n(a)\nFor 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately $36 million of losses, $1,729 million of gains and $1,257 million of losses, respectively, are included in NEER's net income; the balance is included in Corporate and Other. The change in non-qualifying hedge activity is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized. \n(b)\nSee Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of impairment charges related to the investment in XPLR in 2024 and 2023.\n(c)\nFor 2023, approximately $300 million of gains are included in FPL's net income; the balance is included in NEER. See Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets for a discussion of the sale of FPL's ownership interest in its Florida City Gas business (FCG).\n(d)\nSee Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the impairment charge in 2022 related to the investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (Mountain Valley Pipeline).\nNEE segregates into two categories unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses and timing impacts related to derivative transactions. The first category, referred to as non-qualifying hedges, represents certain energy derivative, interest rate derivative and foreign currency transactions entered into as economic hedges, which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting treatment is not elected or has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to certain of the positions are generally not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP. For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. The second category, referred to as trading activities, which is included in adjusted earnings, represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of expected market price movements and all other commodity hedging activities. At FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n2024 Summary\nNet income attributable to NEE for 2024 was lower than 2023 by $364 million, or $0.23 per share, assuming dilution, due to lower results at NEER and FPL, partly offset by higher results at Corporate and Other.\nFPL's net income decreased by $9 million in 2024 primarily driven by the absence of the gain on sale of FPL's ownership interest in the FCG business in 2023 and a lower earned regulatory ROE in 2024, partly offset by continued investments in plant in service and other property.\nNEER's results decreased in 2024 primarily driven by unfavorable non-qualifying hedge activity compared to 2023, partly offset by higher earnings from new investments. In 2024, NEER added approximately 1,365 MW of new wind generating capacity, 2,507 MW of solar generating capacity and 755 MW of battery storage capacity and increased its backlog of contracted renewable development projects. \n38\nTable of Content\ns\nCorporate and Other's results in 2024 increased primarily due to favorable non-qualifying hedge activity.\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are primarily provided by cash flows from operations, borrowings or issuances of short- and long-term debt and, from time to time, issuances of equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors, and sales of tax credits and ownership interests in assets/businesses. See Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet income attributable to NEE for 2024 was $6.95 billion compared to $7.31 billion in 2023. In 2024, net income attributable to NEE decreased primarily due to lower results at NEER and FPL, partly offset by higher results at Corporate and Other. The comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are included in Management's Discussion in NEE's and FPL's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNEE's effective income tax rate for 2024 and 2023 was approximately 6% and 14%, respectively. The rates for both years reflect the impact of renewable energy tax credits. See Note 5.\nFPL: Results of Operations\nFPL obtains its operating revenues primarily from the sale of electricity to retail customers at rates established by the FPSC through base rates and cost recovery clause mechanisms. FPL’s net income for 2024 and 2023 was $4,543 million and $4,552 million, respectively, representing a decrease of $9 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the gain on sale of FPL's ownership interest in the FCG business in 2023 and a lower earned regulatory ROE in 2024, partly offset by higher earnings from investments in plant in service and other property. Such investments grew FPL's average rate base by approximately $6.1 billion in 2024 and reflect, among other things, solar generation additions and ongoing transmission and distribution additions.\nIn December 2024, the FPSC approved FPL's request to begin a surcharge to recover eligible storm costs and replenish the storm reserve totaling approximately $1.2 billion for twelve months beginning in January 2025, related to Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton which impacted FPL's service area in 2024. During 2024, FPL completed a twelve-month interim storm restoration surcharge that began in April 2023 for eligible storm restoration costs and the replenishment of the storm reserve of approximately $1.3 billion, primarily related to Hurricanes Ian and Nicole which impacted FPL's service area in 2022. See Note 1 – Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.\nThe use of reserve amortization is permitted by the 2021 rate agreement. See Item 1. Business – FPL – FPL Regulation – FPL Electric Rate Regulation – Base Rates – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 for additional information on the 2021 rate agreement. In order to earn a targeted regulatory ROE, subject to limitations associated with the 2021 rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items must be adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. In certain periods, reserve amortization is reversed so as not to exceed the targeted regulatory ROE. The drivers of FPL's net income not reflected in the reserve amortization calculation typically include wholesale and transmission service revenues and expenses, cost recovery clause revenues and expenses, AFUDC – equity and revenue and costs not recoverable from retail customers. In 2024 and 2023, FPL recorded reserve amortization of approximately $328 million and $227 million, respectively. See Depreciation and Amortization Expense below. FPL's earned regulatory ROE for 2024 and 2023 was approximately 11.40% and 11.80%, respectively. \nIn March 2024, the FPSC issued a supplemental final order regarding FPL's 2021 rate agreement. An April 2024 appeal of the order filed with the Florida Supreme Court by certain intervenors remains pending. See Note 1 – Rate Regulation. \nDuring 2024, operating revenues decreased $1,346 million primarily related to lower storm cost recovery revenues and lower fuel cost recovery revenues, partly offset by an increase in retail base revenues. \nRetail Base\nFPL’s retail base revenues for 2024 and 2023 reflect the 2021 rate agreement. Retail base revenues increased approximately $272 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily related to an increase of 1.9% in the average number of customer accounts and new retail base rates through its SoBRA mechanism under the 2021 rate agreement. The increases were partly offset by a decrease of approximately 0.5% in the average usage per retail customer primarily driven by unfavorable weather when compared to the prior year. See Note 1 – Rate Regulation. \nIn December 2024, FPL filed a formal notification with the FPSC indicating its intent to initiate a base rate proceeding. See Item 1. Business – FPL – FPL Regulation – FPL Electric Rate Regulation – Base Rates for additional information on the details of FPL's formal notification.\n39\nTable of Content\ns\nCost Recovery Clauses\nRevenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass-through costs, such as franchise fees, revenue taxes and storm-related surcharges, are largely a pass-through of costs. Such revenues also include a return on investment allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery clauses on certain assets, primarily related to certain solar, environmental projects, storm protection plan investments and the unamortized balance of the regulatory asset associated with FPL's acquisition of certain generation facilities. See Item 1. Business – FPL – FPL Regulation – FPL Electric Rate Regulation – Cost Recovery Clauses. Under-recovery or over-recovery of cost recovery clause and other pass-through costs (deferred clause and franchise expenses and revenues) can significantly affect NEE's and FPL's operating cash flows. The change from a net under-recovery of cost recovery clauses at December 31, 2023 to a net over-recovery of cost recovery clauses at December 31, 2024 impacting FPL's operating cash flows was approximately $1,016 million, primarily related to lower fuel prices.\nThe decrease in operating revenues in 2024 reflects lower storm cost recovery revenues of approximately $1,090 million primarily associated with the completion of surcharges for Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, as discussed above. The decrease in operating revenues in 2024 was also impacted by a decrease in fuel cost recovery revenues of approximately $526 million primarily as a result of lower fuel and energy prices. In 2024 and 2023, cost recovery clauses contributed approximately $417 million and $369 million, respectively, to FPL’s net income.\nOther Items Impacting FPL's Consolidated Statements of Income\nFuel, Purchase Power and Interchange Expense\nFuel, purchased power and interchange expense decreased $573 million in 2024 primarily related to lower fuel and energy prices.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nThe major components of FPL’s depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(millions)\nReserve amortization recorded under the 2021 rate agreement\n$\n(328)\n$\n(227)\nOther depreciation and amortization recovered under base rates (excluding reserve amortization) and other\n2,667\n \n2,468 \nDepreciation and amortization primarily recovered under cost recovery clauses and storm-recovery cost amortization\n488\n \n1,548 \nTotal\n$\n2,827\n \n$\n3,789 \nDepreciation expense decreased $962 million during 2024 primarily reflecting lower amortization of deferred storm costs, primarily associated with Hurricanes Ian and Nicole as discussed above, of approximately $1,089 million and lower reserve amortization, partly offset by increased depreciation related to higher plant in service balances. Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2021 rate agreement in order to achieve the targeted regulatory ROE. Reserve amortization is recorded as either an increase or decrease to accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024, approximately $895 million of reserve amortization remains available under the 2021 rate agreement. \nGains on Disposal of Businesses/Assets – net\nIn 2023, gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net primarily relate to the sale of ownership interests in the FCG business. See Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets.\n40\nTable of Content\ns\nNEER: Results of Operations\nNEER owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets in the U.S. and Canada and also includes assets and investments in other clean energy businesses, such as battery storage and natural gas pipelines. NEER also provides full energy and capacity requirements services, engages in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities, owns, develops, constructs and operates rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines and invests in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production assets. NEER’s net income less net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2024 and 2023 was $2,299 million and $3,558 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease in 2024 of $1,259 million. The primary drivers, on an after-tax basis, of the change are in the following table.\n \nIncrease (Decrease) \nFrom Prior Period\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n(millions)\nNew investments\n(a)\n$\n983\n \nExisting clean energy\n(a)\n31\n \nCustomer supply\n(b)\n(230)\nNEET\n(a)\n10\n \nOther, including interest expense, corporate general and administrative expenses and other investment income\n(395)\nChange in non-qualifying hedge activity\n(c)\n(1,765)\nChange in unrealized gains/losses on equity securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds and OTTI, net\n(c)\n(42)\nXPLR investment gains, net\n(c)\n111\n \nImpairment charges related to investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline\n(c)\n38\n \nChange in net income less net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n$\n(1,259)\n______________________\n(a)    Reflects after-tax project contributions, including the net effect of deferred income taxes and other benefits associated with renewable energy tax credits for wind, solar and storage projects, as applicable (see Note 1 – Income Taxes and – Noncontrolling Interests and Note 5), but excludes allocation of interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses except for an allocated credit support charge related to guarantees issued to conduct business activities. Results from projects, pipelines and rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation or ownership. Project results, including repowered wind projects, and pipeline results are included in existing clean energy and rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines are included in NEET beginning with the thirteenth month of operation or ownership. \n(b)    Excludes allocation of interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses except for an allocated credit support charge related to guarantees issued to conduct business activities and includes natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production results.\n(c)    See Overview – Adjusted Earnings for additional information.\nNew Investments\nResults from new investments in 2024 increased primarily due to higher earnings related to new wind and solar generation and battery storage facilities that entered service during or after 2023.\nOther Factors\nSupplemental to the primary drivers of the changes in NEER's results discussed above, the discussion below describes changes in certain line items set forth in NEE's consolidated statements of income as they relate to NEER.\nOperating Revenues\nOperating revenues for 2024 decreased $2,130 million primarily due to:\n•\nthe impact of non-qualifying commodity hedges due primarily to changes in energy prices (approximately $66 million of losses during 2024 compared to $2,529 million of gains for 2023),\npartly offset by,\n•\nrevenues from new investments of $494 million.\nOperating Expenses \n–\n net\nOperating expenses – net for 2024 increased $932 million primarily due to increases of $568 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $175 million in O&M expenses and $119 million in fuel, purchased power and interchange expenses. The increases were primarily associated with growth across the NEER businesses and higher depletion related to natural gas and oil production. \nGains on Disposal of Businesses/Assets \n–\n net\nIn 2024, the change in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net primarily reflect the September 2024 sales of ownership interests in connection with the pipeline joint venture and the renewable assets joint venture. See Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees\nNEER recognized $267 million and $649 million of equity in losses of equity method investees in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in 2024 primarily reflects a 2024 impairment charge of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.6 billion after tax) compared to \n41\nTable of Content\ns\na 2023 impairment charge of $1.2 billion ($0.9 billion after tax) related to the investment in XPLR (see Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements).\nIncome Taxes\nNEER's effective income tax rate for 2024 and 2023 was approximately (165)% and 7%, respectively, and is primarily based on the composition of pretax income in 2024 and 2023 as well as the impact of renewable energy tax credits. PTCs from wind and solar projects and ITCs from solar, battery storage and certain wind projects are included in NEER’s earnings. PTCs are recognized as wind and solar energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes. During the year ended December 31, 2024, renewable energy tax credits increased by approximately $477 million reflecting growth in NEER's business. See Note 1 – Income Taxes for a discussion of renewable energy tax credits, Note 5 and Note 16.\nCorporate and Other: Results of Operations\nCorporate and Other is primarily comprised of the operating results of other business activities, as well as corporate interest income and expenses. Corporate and Other allocates a portion of NEECH's corporate interest expense to NextEra Energy Resources. Interest expense is allocated based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries. \nCorporate and Other's results increased $904 million during 2024 primarily due to favorable after-tax impacts of approximately $934 million, as compared to the prior year, related to non-qualifying hedge activity as a result of changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments used to manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings (see Note 3).\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nNEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are used for, among other things, working capital (see Note 1 \n– Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery\n), capital expenditures (see Note 15 \n–\n Commitments), investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses (see Note 6), payment of maturing debt and related derivative obligations (see Note 13 and Note 3) and, from time to time, redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities. It is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations, short- and long-term borrowings, the issuance of short- and long-term debt (see Note 13) and, from time to time, equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors\n, sales of renewable energy tax credits (see Note 1 – Income Taxes) \nand sales of ownership interests in assets/businesses (see Note 1 \n–\n \nDisposal of Businesses/Assets)\n, consistent with NEE’s and FPL’s objective of maintaining, on a long-term basis, a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating. \nNEE, FPL and NEECH rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. The inability of NEE, FPL and NEECH to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short- and long-term capital, their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies, and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements.\nIn October 2015, NEE authorized a program to purchase, from time to time, up to $150 million of common units representing limited partner interests in XPLR. Under the program, purchases may be made in amounts, at prices and at such times as NEE or its subsidiaries deem appropriate, all subject to market conditions and other considerations. The purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Any purchases will be made in such quantities, at such prices, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as determined by NEE or its subsidiaries in their discretion, based on factors such as market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common unit purchase program does not require NEE to acquire any specific number of common units and may be modified or terminated by NEE at any time. The purpose of the program is not to cause XPLR’s common units to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange or to cause the common units to be deregistered with the SEC. As of December 31, 2024, the dollar value of units that may yet be purchased by NEE under this program was $114 million. At December 31, 2024, NEE had an approximately 52.6% noncontrolling interest in XPLR, primarily through its limited partner interest in XPLR OpCo. \n42\nTable of Content\ns\nCash Flows\nNEE's sources and uses of cash for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(millions)\nSources of cash:\nCash flows from operating activities\n$\n13,260\n \n$\n11,301 \n$\n8,262 \nIssuances of long-term debt, including premiums and discounts\n24,769\n \n13,857 \n13,856 \nProceeds from differential membership investors\n2,257\n \n2,745 \n4,158 \nProceeds from the sale of Florida City Gas business\n—\n \n924 \n— \nSale of independent power and other investments of NEER\n2,659\n \n1,883 \n1,564 \nIssuances of common stock/equity units\n48\n \n4,514 \n1,514 \nNet increase in commercial paper and other short-term debt\n—\n \n2,308 \n957 \nCash swept from related parties – net\n—\n \n1,213 \n240 \nOther sources – net\n—\n \n— \n89 \nTotal sources of cash\n42,993\n \n38,745 \n30,640 \nUses of cash:\nCapital expenditures, independent power and other investments and nuclear fuel purchases\n(24,729)\n(25,113)\n(19,283)\nRetirements of long-term debt\n(10,113)\n(7,978)\n(4,525)\nNet decrease in commercial paper and other short-term debt\n(3,018)\n— \n— \nPayments to differential membership investors\n(740)\n(75)\n(179)\nRepayments of swept cash to related parties – net\n(1,371)\n— \n— \nDividends on common stock\n(4,235)\n(3,782)\n(3,352)\nOther uses – net\n(791)\n(1,814)\n(1,169)\nTotal uses of cash\n(44,997)\n(38,762)\n(28,508)\nEffects of currency translation on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(14)\n(4)\n(7)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(2,018)\n$\n(21)\n$\n2,125 \nFor significant financing activity that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2024, see Note 13.\nNEE's primary capital requirements are for expanding and enhancing FPL's electric system and generation facilities to continue to provide reliable service to meet customer electricity demands and for funding NEER's investments in independent power and other projects. \nSee Note 15 – Commitments for estimated capital expenditures in 2025 through 2029. \nThe following table provides a summary of capital investments for \n2024\n, \n2023\n and \n2022\n. \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(millions)\nFPL:\nGeneration:\nNew\n$\n2,479\n \n$\n3,163 \n$\n2,079 \nExisting\n967\n \n1,441 \n1,804 \nTransmission and distribution\n4,425\n \n4,292 \n4,553 \nNuclear fuel\n222\n \n98 \n118 \nGeneral and other\n636\n \n688 \n581 \nOther, primarily change in accrued property additions and the exclusion of AFUDC – equity\n(515)\n(282)\n50 \nTotal\n8,214\n \n9,400 \n9,185 \nNEER:\nWind\n4,355\n \n4,793 \n3,481 \nSolar (includes solar plus battery storage projects)\n7,327\n \n5,448 \n2,880 \nOther clean energy\n2,213\n \n2,837 \n1,052 \nNuclear (includes nuclear fuel)\n344\n \n228 \n214 \nCustomer supply – natural gas and oil production\n1,167\n \n1,575 \n1,215 \nRate-regulated transmission\n650\n \n317 \n431 \nOther \n336\n \n454 \n372 \nTotal\n16,392\n \n15,652 \n9,645 \nCorporate and Other\n123\n \n61 \n453 \nTotal capital expenditures, independent power and other investments and nuclear fuel purchases\n$\n24,729\n \n$\n25,113 \n$\n19,283 \n43\nTable of Content\ns\nLiquidity\nAt December 31, 2024, NEE's total net available liquidity was approximately $18.0 billion.

The entire amount of the credit facilities is available for general corporate purposes and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies’ or their subsidiaries’ operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss). FPL’s syndicated revolving credit facilities are also available to support the purchase of $1,663 million of pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds in the event they are tendered by individual bondholders and not remarketed prior to maturity as well as the repayment of approximately $1,979 million of floating rate notes in the event an individual noteholder requires repayment at specified dates prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $575 million of FPL's and $5,422 million of NEECH's syndicated revolving credit facilities expire over the next 12 months.\n(b)    Only available for the funding of loans. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $925 million of FPL's and $2,600 million of NEECH's bilateral revolving credit facilities expire over the next 12 months.\n(c)    Only available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $1,180 million of the letter of credit facilities expire over the next 12 months.\nApproximately 74 banks, located globally, participate in FPL’s and NEECH’s revolving credit facilities, with no one bank providing more than 5% of the combined revolving credit facilities. Pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement, NEE guarantees the payment of NEECH’s debt obligations under its revolving credit facilities. In order for FPL or NEECH to borrow or to have letters of credit issued under the terms of their respective revolving credit facilities and, also for NEECH, its letter of credit facilities, FPL, in the case of FPL, and NEE, in the case of NEECH, are required, among other things, to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization that does not exceed a stated ratio. The FPL and NEECH revolving credit facilities also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, failure of FPL and NEE, as the case may be, to maintain the respective ratio of funded debt to total capitalization at or below the specified ratio. At December 31, 2024, each of NEE and FPL was in compliance with its required ratio.\nCapital Support\nGuarantees, Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Indemnifications (Guarantee Arrangements) \nCertain subsidiaries of NEE issue guarantees and obtain letters of credit and surety bonds, as well as provide indemnities, to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings. Substantially all of the guarantee arrangements are on behalf of NEE’s consolidated subsidiaries, as discussed in more detail below. See Note 8 regarding guarantees of obligations on behalf of XPLR subsidiaries. NEE is not required to recognize liabilities associated with guarantee arrangements issued on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that they will be required to perform. At December 31, 2024, NEE believes that there is no material exposure related to these guarantee arrangements.\nNEE subsidiaries issue guarantees related to equity contribution agreements and engineering, procurement and construction agreements, associated with the development, construction and financing of certain power generation facilities (see Note 1 – Structured Payables) and a natural gas pipeline project, as well as a natural gas transportation agreement. Commitments associated with these activities are included in the contracts table in Note 15. \nIn addition, at December 31, 2024, NEE subsidiaries had approximately $6.4 billion in guarantees related to obligations under PPAs and acquisition agreements, nuclear-related activities, payment obligations related to PTCs, support for NEER's retail electricity provider activities, as well as other types of contractual obligations (see Note 15 – Commitments). \n44\nTable of Content\ns\nIn some instances, subsidiaries of NEE elect to issue guarantees instead of posting other forms of collateral required under certain financing arrangements, as well as for other project-level cash management activities. At December 31, 2024, these guarantees totaled approximately $1.8 billion and support, among other things, cash management activities, including those related to debt service and operations and maintenance service agreements, as well as other specific project financing requirements.\nSubsidiaries of NEE also issue guarantees to support customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading activities, including the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities. At December 31, 2024, the estimated mark-to-market exposure (the total amount that these subsidiaries of NEE could be required to fund based on energy commodity market prices at December 31, 2024) plus contract settlement net payables, net of collateral posted for obligations under these guarantees totaled approximately $1.6 billion.\nAt December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE also had approximately $5.6 billion of standby letters of credit and approximately $1.6 billion of surety bonds to support certain of the commercial activities discussed above. FPL's and NEECH's credit facilities are available to support substantially all of the standby letters of credit.\nIn addition, as part of contract negotiations in the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of NEE have agreed and in the future may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties, including those associated with asset divestitures, for possible unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events. The specified events may include, but are not limited to, an adverse judgment in a lawsuit, or the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretations of the tax law. NEE is unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments by its subsidiaries under some of these contracts because events that would obligate them to make payments have not occurred or, if any such event has occurred, they have not been notified of its occurrence.\nNEECH, a 100% owned subsidiary of NEE, provides funding for, and holds ownership interests in, NEE's operating subsidiaries other than FPL. NEE has fully and unconditionally guaranteed certain payment obligations of NEECH, including most of its debt and all of its debentures registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and commercial paper issuances, as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications, and NEECH has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of subsidiaries within the NEER segment. Certain guarantee arrangements described above contain requirements for NEECH and FPL to maintain a specified credit rating. For a discussion of credit rating downgrade triggers, see Credit Ratings below.\nNEE fully and unconditionally guarantees NEECH debentures pursuant to a guarantee agreement, dated as of June 1, 1999 (1999 guarantee) and NEECH junior subordinated debentures pursuant to an indenture, dated as of September 1, 2006 (2006 guarantee). The 1999 guarantee is an unsecured obligation of NEE and ranks equally and ratably with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of NEE. The 2006 guarantee is unsecured and subordinate and junior in right of payment to NEE senior indebtedness (as defined therein). No payment on those junior subordinated debentures may be made under the 2006 guarantee until all NEE senior indebtedness has been paid in full in certain circumstances. NEE’s and NEECH’s ability to meet their financial obligations are primarily dependent on their subsidiaries’ net income, cash flows and their ability to pay upstream dividends or to repay funds to NEE and NEECH. The dividend-paying ability of some of the subsidiaries is limited by contractual restrictions which are contained in outstanding financing agreements.\n45\nTable of Content\ns\nSummarized financial information of NEE and NEECH is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nIssuer/Guarantor Combined\n(a)\nNEECH Consolidated\n(b)\nNEE Consolidated\n(b)\n(millions)\nOperating revenues\n$\n(2)\n$\n7,846\n \n$\n24,753\n \nOperating income (loss)\n$\n(331)\n$\n1,254\n \n$\n7,479\n \nNet income (loss)\n$\n(12)\n$\n1,156\n \n$\n5,698\n \nNet income (loss) attributable to NEE/NEECH\n$\n(12)\n$\n2,405\n \n$\n6,946\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nIssuer/Guarantor Combined\n(a)\nNEECH Consolidated\n(b)\nNEE Consolidated\n(b)\n(millions)\nTotal current assets \n$\n557\n \n$\n7,166\n \n$\n11,951\n \nTotal noncurrent assets \n$\n2,625\n \n$\n85,583\n \n$\n178,193\n \nTotal current liabilities\n$\n6,563\n \n$\n18,080\n \n$\n25,355\n \nTotal noncurrent liabilities\n$\n33,793\n \n$\n58,074\n \n$\n103,928\n \nRedeemable noncontrolling interests\n$\n—\n \n$\n401\n \n$\n401\n \nNoncontrolling interests\n$\n—\n \n$\n10,359\n \n$\n10,359\n \n______________________\n(a)    Excludes intercompany transactions, and investments in, and equity in earnings of, subsidiaries.\n(b)    Information has been prepared on the same basis of accounting as NEE's consolidated financial statements.\nShelf Registration\nIn March 2024, NEE, NEECH and FPL filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified amount of securities, which became effective upon filing. The amount of securities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective boards of directors. Securities that may be issued under the registration statement include, depending on the registrant, senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, junior subordinated debentures, first mortgage bonds, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units, warrants and guarantees related to certain of those securities. \n46\nTable of Content\ns\nCredit Ratings\nNEE’s liquidity, ability to access credit and capital markets, cost of borrowings and collateral posting requirements under certain agreements is dependent on its and its subsidiaries credit ratings. At February 14, 2025, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s), S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to NEE, FPL and NEECH:\nMoody's\n(a)\nS&P\n(a)\nFitch\n(a)\nNEE:\n(b)\nCorporate credit rating\nBaa1\nA-\nA-\nFPL:\n(b)\nCorporate credit rating\nA1\nA\nA\nFirst mortgage bonds \nAa2\nA+\nAA-\nSenior unsecured notes\nA1\nA\nA+\nPollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds\n(c)\nVMIG-1/P-1\nA-1\nF1\nCommercial paper\nP-1\nA-1\nF1\nNEECH:\n(b)\nCorporate credit rating\nBaa1\nA-\nA-\nDebentures\nBaa1\nBBB+\nA-\nJunior subordinated debentures\nBaa2\nBBB\nBBB\nCommercial paper\nP-2\nA-2\nF2\n_________________________\n(a)    A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.\n(b)    The outlook indicated by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch is stable.\n(c)    Short-term ratings are presented as all bonds outstanding are currently paying a short-term interest rate. At FPL's election, a portion or all of the bonds may be adjusted to a long-term interest rate.\nNEE and its subsidiaries have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt. A change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments, and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit facilities noted above, the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities.\nCommitment fees and interest rates on loans under these credit facilities’ agreements are tied to credit ratings. A ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances and borrowings and additional or replacement credit facilities. In addition, a ratings downgrade could result in, among other things, the requirement that NEE subsidiaries post collateral under certain agreements and guarantee arrangements, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel procurement, power sales and purchases, nuclear decommissioning funding, debt-related reserves and trading activities. FPL’s and NEECH’s credit facilities are available to support these potential requirements.\nCovenants\nNEE's charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. As a practical matter, the ability of NEE to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon, among other things, dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries. For example, FPL pays dividends to NEE in a manner consistent with FPL's long-term targeted capital structure. However, the mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends to NEE and the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds. Additionally, in some circumstances, the mortgage restricts the amount of retained earnings that FPL can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock. The restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage. Other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends, the mortgage does not restrict FPL's use of retained earnings. At December 31, 2024, no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage and, in light of FPL's current financial condition and level of earnings, management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations.\nFPL may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage, wh\nich generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on, or at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of, FPL’s first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and all indebtedness of FPL that ranks prior or equal to the first mortgage bonds. At December 31, 2024, coverage for the 12 months ended December 31, 2024 would have been approximately 7.5 times the annual interest requirements and approximately 3.3 times the aggregate principal requirements. New first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of 60% of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements, the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee. At December 31, 2024, FPL could have issued in excess of $36 billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and retired first mortgage bonds. At December 31, 2024, no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes.\n47\nTable of Content\ns\nIn September 2006, NEE and NEECH executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (as amended, September 2006 RCC) in connection with NEECH's offering of $350 million principal amount of Series B Enhanced Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (Series B junior subordinated debentures). The September 2006 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of long-term indebtedness (covered debt) of NEECH (other than the Series B junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of NEE. NEECH's 3.50% Debentures, Series due April 1, 2029 have been designated as the covered debt under the September 2006 RCC. The September 2006 RCC provides that NEECH may redeem, and NEE or NEECH may purchase, any Series B junior subordinated debentures on or before October 1, 2036, only to the extent that the redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount of proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities, subject to certain limitations described in the September 2006 RCC. Qualifying securities are securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the Series B junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption or purchase, which are sold within 365 days prior to the date of the redemption or repurchase of the Series B junior subordinated debentures.\nIn June 2007, NEE and NEECH executed a Replacement Capital Covenant (as amended, June 2007 RCC) in connection with NEECH's offering of $400 million principal amount of its Series C Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 (Series C junior subordinated debentures). The June 2007 RCC is for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series of covered debt of NEECH (other than the Series C junior subordinated debentures) or, in certain cases, of NEE. NEECH's 3.50% Debentures, Series due April 1, 2029 have been designated as the covered debt under the June 2007 RCC. The June 2007 RCC provides that NEECH may redeem or purchase, or satisfy, discharge or defease (collectively, defease), and NEE and any majority-owned subsidiary of NEE or NEECH may purchase, any Series C junior subordinated debentures on or before June 15, 2037, only to the extent that the principal amount defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed a specified amount raised from the issuance, during the 365 days prior to the date of that redemption, purchase or defeasance, of qualifying securities that have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the Series C junior subordinated debentures at the time of redemption, purchase or defeasance, subject to certain limitations described in the June 2007 RCC.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting estimates are those that NEE believes are both most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and require complex, subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the critical accounting estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. NEE’s significant accounting policies, including those requiring critical accounting estimates, are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared under GAAP. Further details regarding NEE's critical accounting estimates are as follows:\nAccounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nNEE\n \nuses derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings. In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of its power generation and natural gas and oil production assets and engages in power and\n fuel \nmarketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements.\nNature of Accounting Estimates\nAccounting pronouncements require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met, which may require significant judgment to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. This applies not only to traditional financial derivative instruments, but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative. As a result, significant judgment must be used in applying derivatives accounting guidance to contracts. In the event changes in interpretation occur, it is possible that contracts that currently are excluded from derivatives accounting rules would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in the statement of income.\nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nDerivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value using a combination of market and income approaches. Fair values for some of the longer-term contracts where liquid markets are not available are derived through the use of industry-standard valuation techniques, such as internally developed models which estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices. Forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date. \nThe near-term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes. However, in the later years, the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity, the expected system heat rate (which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity) in the region where the purchase or sale takes place, and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region. NEE estimates the fair value of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing\n \nthe net amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the \n48\nTable of Content\ns\nderivative agreements. The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative.\nAt FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the\n fuel clause\n. See Note 3.\nIn NEE’s non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the derivatives’ fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees’ related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE’s consolidated statements of income. \nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE estimates the fair value of these derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing observable inputs. \nCertain derivative transactions at NEER are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting has been discontinued. \nChanges in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are reflected in the non-qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings and could be significant to NEER’s results because the economic offset to the positions are not marked to market. As a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP. For this reason, NEE’s management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3, Overview and Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity.\nAccounting for Pension Benefits\nNEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. Management believes that, based on actuarial assumptions and the well-funded status of the pension plan, NEE will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefits under the plan. NEE allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria.\nNature of Accounting Estimates\nFor the pension plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value, as of the December 31 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including an estimate of the average remaining life of employees/survivors as well as the average years of service rendered. The projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels. NEE derives pension income from actuarial calculations based on the plan’s provisions and various management assumptions including discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nAccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.\n49\nTable of Content\ns\nNet periodic pension income is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Those assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 include:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n4.88\n \n%\n5.05 \n%\n2.87 \n%\nSalary increase\n4.90\n \n%\n4.90 \n%\n4.90 \n%\nExpected long-term rate of return, net of investment management fees\n8.00\n \n%\n8.00 \n%\n7.35 \n%\nWeighted-average interest crediting rate\n3.89\n \n%\n3.82 \n%\n3.79 \n%\nIn developing these assumptions, NEE evaluated input, including other qualitative and quantitative factors, from its actuaries and consultants, as well as information available in the marketplace. Discount rates are established using the full yield curve approach. In addition, for the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, NEE considered different models, capital market return assumptions and historical returns for a portfolio with an equity/bond asset mix similar to\n its pension fund, as well as its pension fund's historical compounded returns. \nNEE will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions, including its expected rate of return, at least annually, and will adjust them as appropriate.\nNEE utilizes in its determination of pension income a market-related valuation of plan assets. This market-related valuation reduces year-to-year volatility and recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period following the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of plan assets and the actual return realized on those plan assets. Since the market-related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of plan assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. Such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension income only to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market-related value of plan assets.\nThe following table illustrates the effect on net periodic pension income of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant:\nIncrease (Decrease) in 2024\nNet Periodic Pension Income\nChange in\nAssumption\nNEE\nFPL\n(millions)\nExpected long-term rate of return\n0.5%\n$\n26 \n$\n16 \nDiscount rate\n(0.5)%\n$\n1 \n$\n1 \nSalary increase\n0.5%\n$\n(2)\n$\n(1)\nNEE also utilizes actuarial assumptions about mortality to help estimate obligations of the pension plan. NEE has adopted the latest revised mortality tables and mortality improvement scales released by the Society of Actuaries, which did not have a material impact on the pension plan's obligation.\nSee Note 12.\nCarrying Value of Long-Lived Assets\nNEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nNature of Accounting Estimates\nThe amount of future net cash flows, the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events. In particular, the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists, and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value. Because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long-lived asset, the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized.\n50\nTable of Content\ns\nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nAn impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset’s fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate.\n \nCarrying Value of Equity Method Investments\nNEE tests its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value\n. \nNature of Accounting Estimates\nIndicators of impairment may include, but are not limited to, a series of operating losses of an investee, the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity and a current fair value of an investment that may be less than its carrying value. If indicators of impairment exist, an estimate of the investment’s fair value will be calculated. Approaches for estimating fair value include, among others, an income approach using a probability-weighted discounted cash flows model, a market approach using an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple model, and a market observable transaction. The probability assigned to each scenario as well as the cash flows and EBITDA multiple identified are critical in determining fair value. \nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nAn impairment loss is required to be recognized if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Assessment of whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired involves, among other factors, consideration of the length of time that the fair value is below the carrying value, current expected performance relative to the expected performance when the investment was initially made, performance relative to peers, industry performance relative to the economy, credit rating, regulatory actions and legal and permitting challenges. If management is unable to reasonably assert that an impairment is temporary or believes that there will not be full recovery of the carrying value of its investment, then the impairment is considered to be other than temporary. Investments that are other than temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated fair value and cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value. Impairment losses are recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE’s consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\nDecommissioning and Dismantlement\nNEE accounts for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. \nNEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities.\nNature of Accounting Estimates\nThe calculation of the future cost of retiring long-lived assets, including nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement costs, involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation. Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes, among other things, making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how costs will escalate with inflation. In addition, NEE also makes interest rate and rate of return projections on its investments in determining recommended funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. Periodically, NEE is required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized, the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs. For example, an increase of 0.25% in the assumed escalation rates for nuclear decommissioning costs would increase NEE’s AROs at December 31, 2024 by approximately\n $208 million.\nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nFPL \n–\n \nFor ratemaking purpos\nes, FPL accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are approved by the FPSC. The most recent studies, filed in 2020, reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL’s nuclear units at the time of the studies. FPL’s portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units, including spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $9.6 billion, or $2.5 billion expressed in 2024 dollars. The ultimate costs of decommissioning reflect the applications submitted to the NRC for the extension of St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 licenses for an additional 20 years, as well as the license renewals for Turkey Point Units No. 3 and 4 approved in 2024.\n51\nTable of Content\ns\nFPL accrues the cost of dismantling its other generation plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the FPSC. Unlike nuclear decommissioning, dismantlement costs are not funded. The most recent studies became effective January 1, 2022. At December 31, 2024, FPL’s portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its other generation units is approximately $2.5 billion, or $1.2 billion expressed in 2024 dollars. The majority of the dismantlement costs are not reported as AROs. FPL accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. Any differences between the amount of the ARO \nand the amount recorded for ratemaking purposes are reported as a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with regulatory accounting.\nThe components of FPL’s decommissioning of nuclear plants, dismantlement of plants and other accrued asset removal costs are as follows:\nNuclear\nDecommissioning\nOther Generation Plant\nDismantlement\nInterim Removal\nCosts and Other\nTotal\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n(millions)\nAROs\n(a)\n$\n1,959\n \n$\n1,882 \n$\n331\n \n$\n283 \n$\n5\n \n$\n5 \n$\n2,295\n \n$\n2,170 \nLess capitalized ARO asset net of accumulated depreciation\n58\n \n59 \n82\n \n28 \n—\n \n— \n140\n \n87 \nAccrued asset removal costs\n(b)\n509\n \n480\n191\n \n182\n(1,375)\n(1,023)\n(675)\n(361)\nAsset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference\n(c)\n4,936\n \n4,202 \n(130)\n(150)\n—\n \n— \n4,806\n \n4,052 \nAccrued decommissioning, dismantlement and other accrued asset removal costs\n(d)\n$\n7,346\n \n$\n6,505 \n$\n310\n \n$\n287 \n$\n(1,370)\n$\n(1,018)\n$\n6,286\n \n$\n5,774 \n______________________\n(a)    See Note 11.\n(b)    Included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE’s and FPL’s consolidated balance sheets, except for $1,373 million and \n$1,021 million which are related to interim removal costs and are included in noncurrent regulatory assets as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning or dismantlement activities are expected to be complete. At \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, the AROs for decommissioning of NEER’s nuclear plants approximate\nd $646 million and\n \n$\n607 million, respectively. NEER’s portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approxima\ntely $9.8 billion, or $2.2 billion ex\npressed in 2024 dollars. At \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, the AROs for dismantling certain of NEER’s wind facilities approximate\nd $329 million and $296 million, respectively, and for dismantling certain of NEER's solar facilities approximated $315 million and $256 million, respectively.\nSee Note 1 \n–\n Asset Retirement Obligations and \n–\n Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs and Note 11.\nRegulatory Accounting\nCertain of NEE's businesses are subject to rate regulation which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1 \n–\n Rate Regulation for details regarding NEE’s regulatory assets and liabilities. \nNature of Accounting Estimates\nRegulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and liabilities are included in rate base or otherwise earn (pay) a return on investment during the recovery period.\n52\nTable of Content\ns\nAssumptions and Accounting Approach\nAccounting guidance allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities. If NEE's rate-regulated entities, primarily FPL, were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the regulators, including the FPSC for FPL, have the authority to disallow recovery of costs that they consider excessive or imprudently incurred. Such costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when generation facilities are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities. The continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period.\nENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING AND MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY\nNEE and FPL are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. \nFinancial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of NEE and FPL described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading. Market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices, interest rates or equity prices over the next year. \nManagement has established risk management policies to monitor and manage such market risks, as well as credit risks.\nCommodity Price Risk\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. In addition, NEE, through NEER, uses derivatives to optimize the value of its power generation and natural gas and oil production assets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements.

NEE and FPL manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates, entering into interest rate contracts and using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. Interest rate contracts are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements.\n54\nTable of Content\ns\nThe following are estimates of the fair value of NEE's and FPL's financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n \nCarrying\nAmount\nEstimated\nFair Value\n(a)\n \nCarrying\nAmount\nEstimated\nFair Value\n(a)\n \n(millions)\nNEE:\n \n \n \n \n \nSpecial use funds\n$\n2,294\n \n$\n2,294\n \n$\n2,222 \n$\n2,222 \nOther investments, primarily debt securities\n$\n2,007\n \n$\n2,007\n \n$\n1,802 \n$\n1,802 \nLong-term debt, including current portion\n$\n80,446\n \n$\n76,428\n \n$\n68,306 \n$\n64,103 \nInterest rate contracts \n–\n net unrealized gains (losses)\n$\n293\n \n$\n293\n \n$\n(249)\n$\n(249)\nFPL:\n \n \n \n \n \nSpecial use funds\n$\n1,741\n \n$\n1,741\n \n$\n1,658 \n$\n1,658 \nLong-term debt, including current portion\n$\n26,745\n \n$\n24,718\n \n$\n25,274 \n$\n23,430 \n______________________\n(a)    See Note 3 and Note 4.\nThe special use funds of NEE and FPL consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for FPL and for the decommissioning of NEE's and FPL's nuclear power plants. See Note 1 – Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery. A portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities primarily carried at estimated fair value. At FPL, changes in fair value, including any credit losses, result in a corresponding adjustment to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment. The changes in fair value for NEE's non-rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income, except for credit losses and unrealized losses on available for sale securities intended or required to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are reported in current period earnings. Because the funds set aside by FPL for storm damage could be needed at any time, the related investments are generally more liquid and, therefore, are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. The nuclear decommissioning funds, in contrast, are generally invested in longer-term securities.\nAt December 31, 2024, NEE had interest rate contracts with a net notional amount of approximately $35.2 billion to manage exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily associated with expected future and outstanding debt issuances at NEECH and NEER.\nBased upon a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates, the fair value of NEE’s net liabilities would increase by approxim\nately $3,475 million ($1,153 million f\nor FPL) at December 31, 2024.\nEquity Price Risk\nNEE and FPL are exposed to risk resulting from changes in prices for equity securities. For example, NEE’s nuclear decommissioning reserve funds include marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately $6,164 million and $5,290 million ($4,219 million and $3,536 million for FPL) at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. NEE's and FPL’s investment strategy for equity securities in their nuclear decommissioning reserve funds emphasizes marketable securities which are broadly diversified. At December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the prices quoted on stock exchanges would result in an approximately $577 million ($388 million for FPL) reduction in fair value. For FPL, a corresponding adjustment would be made to the related regulatory asset or liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment, and for NEE’s non-rate regulated operations, a corresponding amount would be recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds – net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. \nCredit Risk\nNEE and its subsidiaries, including FPL, are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations. Credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation. NEE manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies, including counterparty credit limits, and in some cases credit enhancements, such as cash prepayments, letters of credit, cash and other collateral and guarantees.\n55\nTable of Content\ns\nCredit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements. NEE’s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis. For all derivative and contractual transactions, NEE’s energy marketing and trading operations, which include FPL's energy marketing and trading division, are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions. Some relevant considerations when assessing NEE’s energy marketing and trading operations’ credit risk exposure include the following:\n•\nOperations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry.\n•\nTrade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy, utility and financial services related companies, as well as municipalities, cooperatives and other trading companies in the U.S.\n•\nOverall credit risk is managed through established credit policies and is overseen by the EMC.\n•\nProspective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards, with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms, such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral.\n•\nMaster netting agreements are used to offset cash and noncash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty. NEE’s policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties.\nBased on NEE’s policies and risk exposures related to credit, NEE and FPL do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. At December 31, 2024, NEE's credit risk exposure associated with its energy marketing and trading operations, taking into account collateral and contractual netting rights, totaled approximately \n$2.6 billion\n ($64 million for FPL), of which approximately 88% (99% for FPL) was with companies that have investment grade credit ratings. See Note 3.\nItem 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nSee Management’s Discussion – Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity.\n56\nTable of Content\ns\nItem 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nMANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nNextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NEE) and Florida Power & Light Company's (FPL) management are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The consolidated financial statements, which in part are based on informed judgments and estimates made by management, have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.\nTo aid in carrying out this responsibility, we, along with all other members of management, maintain a system of internal accounting control which is established after weighing the cost of such controls against the benefits derived. In the opinion of management, the overall system of internal accounting control provides reasonable assurance that the assets of NEE and FPL and their subsidiaries are safeguarded and that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and are properly recorded for the preparation of financial statements. In addition, management believes the overall system of internal accounting control provides reasonable assurance that material errors or irregularities would be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their duties. Any system of internal accounting control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that controls can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting.\nThe system of internal accounting control is supported by written policies and guidelines, the selection and training of qualified employees, an organizational structure that provides an appropriate division of responsibility and a program of internal auditing. NEE's written policies include a Code of Business Conduct & Ethics that states management's policy on conflicts of interest and ethical conduct. Compliance with the Code of Business Conduct & Ethics is confirmed annually by key personnel.\nThe Board of Directors pursues its oversight responsibility for financial reporting and accounting through its Audit Committee. This Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, meets regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors to make inquiries as to the manner in which the responsibilities of each are being discharged. The independent auditors and the internal audit staff have free access to the Committee without management present to discuss auditing, internal accounting control and financial reporting matters.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n. Based on this assessment, management believes that NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nNEE's and FPL's independent registered public accounting firm, \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n, is engaged to express an opinion on NEE's and FPL's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on NEE's and FPL's internal control over financial reporting. Their reports are based on procedures believed by them to provide a reasonable basis to support such opinions. These reports appear on the following pages.\nJOHN W. KETCHUM\nBRIAN W. BOLSTER\nJohn W.

In our opinion, NEE and FPL maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 of NEE and FPL and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed unqualified opinions on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nNEE's and FPL’s management are responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for their assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on NEE’s and FPL’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to NEE and FPL in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nBoca Raton, Florida\nFebruary 14, 2025 \n58\nTable of Content\ns\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of\n    NextEra Energy, Inc. and Florida Power & Light Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NextEra Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (NEE) and the related separate consolidated balance sheets of Florida Power & Light Company and subsidiaries (FPL) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and NEE's and FPL's related consolidated statements of income and cash flows, NEE's consolidated statements of comprehensive income and equity, and FPL’s consolidated statements of common shareholder’s equity, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of NEE and FPL as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), NEE’s and FPL’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 14, 2025, expressed unqualified opinions on NEE’s and FPL’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of NEE’s and FPL’s management. Our responsibility is to express opinions on NEE’s and FPL’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to NEE and FPL in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements of NEE and FPL that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nNEE – Operating Revenue – Unrealized Losses – Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description \nNEE enters into complex energy derivatives and transacts in certain markets that are thinly traded, which may result in subjective estimates of fair value that include unobservable inputs. Changes in the derivatives’ fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are primarily recognized on a net basis in operating revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2024, unrealized losses associated with Level 3 transactions of $\n25\n million are included in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of income of NEE.\nGiven management uses complex proprietary models and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities, performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our firm specialists who possess significant quantitative and modeling expertise.\n59\nTable of Content\ns\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to operating revenue – unrealized losses included the following, among others: \n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls relating to commodity valuation models, their related Level 3 unobservable inputs, and market data validation.\n•\nWe selected a sample of transactions, obtained an understanding of the business rationale of transactions, and read the underlying contractual agreements.\n•\nWe used personnel in our firm who specialize in energy transacting to independently value Level 3 transactions. For certain fair value models, we used our firm specialists to directly test the underlying assumptions of the unobservable inputs used by management.\n•\nWe evaluated NEE’s disclosures related to the proprietary models and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities, including the balances recorded and significant assumptions.\nFPL \n–\n Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description \nFPL is subject to rate regulation by the Florida Public Service Commission (the “FPSC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric utility companies. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; fuel expense; operation and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense.\nRates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of FPL’s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, FPL’s investment in the assets required to deliver utility service. Accounting guidance for FPL’s regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if it is probable that such rates will be charged and collected. The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. Future FPSC decisions could impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of recoverable costs and any refunds that may be required. As a result of this cost-based regulation, FPL follows the accounting guidance that allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities, based on the probability of future cash flows, that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. \nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the requirement to have auditors with deep knowledge of and significant experience with accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the impact of rate regulation included the following, among others: \n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment and regulatory assets or liabilities, including storm restoration costs; the depreciation and amortization of such amounts in accordance with FPSC orders; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs recognized as property, plant and equipment and regulatory assets in future rates or of a refund or future reduction in rates that should be recognized as a regulatory liability.\n•\nWe assessed the likelihood of (1) recovery of recorded regulatory assets and (2) obligations requiring future reductions in rates by obtaining, reading, and evaluating relevant regulatory orders issued by the FPSC to FPL, and considering regulatory precedents established by the FPSC. We also evaluated such regulatory orders and other publicly available filings made by FPL and compared them to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nWe evaluated FPL's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nBoca Raton, Florida\nFebruary 14, 2025\nWe

AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYears Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 \n1. \nSummary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\n – The operations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) are conducted primarily through Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a wholly owned subsidiary, and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NextEra Energy Resources) and NextEra Energy Transmission, LLC (NEET) (collectively, NEER), wholly owned indirect subsidiaries that are combined for segment reporting purposes.\nFPL's principal business is a rate-regulated electric utility which supplies electric service to more than\n \nsix million\n customer accounts throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and \neight\n counties throughout northwest Florida. NEER invests in independent power projects through both controlled and consolidated entities and noncontrolling owner\nship interests in joint ventures. NEER participates in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through operating and non-operating ownership interests and in pipeline infrastructure through noncontrolling or joint venture interests. NEER also invests in rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities to the electric grid through controlled and consolidated entities \nand a noncontrolling owner\nship interest. \nThe consolidated financial statements of NEE and FPL include the accounts of their respective controlled subsidiaries. They also include NEE's and FPL's share of the undivided interest in certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Amounts representing NEE's interest in entities it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in investment in equity method investees; the earnings/losses of these entities is included in \nequity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees\n. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts included in prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of c\nontingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nOperating Revenues \n–\n FPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE’s operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers as further discussed in Note 2\n, as well as, at NEER, derivative and lease transactions. FPL's operating revenues include amounts resulting from base rates, cost recovery clauses (see Rate Regulation below), franchise fees, gross receipts taxes and surcharges related to storms (see Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below). Franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are imposed on FPL; however, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) allows FPL to include in the amounts charged to customers the amount of the gross receipts tax for all customers and the franchise fee for those customers located in the jurisdiction that imposes the amount. Accordingly, FPL's franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are reported gross in operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes and other in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income and were approximately $\n1,053\n million, $\n1,139\n million and $\n1,035\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. FPL also collects municipal utility taxes which are reported gross in customer receivables and accounts payable on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Certain NEER commodity contracts for the purchase and sale of power that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue. See Energy Trading below and Note 3.\nRate Regulation\n – FPL, the most significant of NEE's rate-regulated subsidiaries, is subject to rate regulation by the FPSC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Its rates are designed to recover the cost of providing service to its customers including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. As a result of this cost-based regulation, FPL follows the accounting guidance that allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non-rate regulated entities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process.\n70\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

See Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below.\n(d)\nSee Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization below.\nCost recovery clauses, which are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through various clauses, include substantially all fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, costs associated with an FPSC-approved transmission and distribution storm protection plan, certain costs associated with the acquisition and retirement of several electric generation facilities, certain construction-related costs for certain of FPL's solar generation facilities, and conservation and certain environmental-related costs.\n \nRevenues from cost recovery clauses are recorded when billed; FPL achieves matching of costs and related revenues by deferring the net under-recovery or over-recovery. Any under-recovered costs or over-recovered revenues are collected from or returned to customers in subsequent periods.\nIf FPL were no longer subject to cost-based rate regulation, the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund. In addition, the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. The continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period. Regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed within various subsections below. \nBase Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 – In December 2021, the FPSC issued a final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2021 rate agreement).\nKey elements of the 2021 rate agreement, which is effective from January 2022 through December 2025, include, among other things, the following:\n•\nNew retail base rates and charges were established resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues:\n◦\n$\n692\n million beginning January 1, 2022, and\n◦\n$\n560\n million beginning January 1, 2023.\n71\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n•\nIn addition, FPL received base rate increases associated with the addition of up to \n894\n megawatts (MW) annually of new solar generation (through a Solar Base Rate Adjustment (SoBRA) mechanism) in each of 2024 and 2025. FPL's recovery through the SoBRA mechanism was limited to an installed cost cap of $\n1,250\n per kilowatt.\n•\nFPL's authorized regulatory return on common equity (ROE) was \n10.60\n%, with a range of \n9.70\n% to \n11.70\n%. However, in the event the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate was \n2.49\n% or greater over a consecutive \nsix-month\n period, FPL was authorized to increase the regulatory ROE to \n10.80\n% with a range of \n9.80\n% to \n11.80\n%. During August 2022, this provision was triggered and effective September 1, 2022, FPL's authorized regulatory ROE and ROE range were increased. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below \n9.80\n%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above \n11.80\n%, any party with standing may seek a review of FPL's retail base rates.\n•\nSubject to certain conditions, FPL may amortize, over the term of the 2021 rate agreement, up to $\n1.45\n billion of depreciation reserve surplus, provided that in any year of the 2021 rate agreement FPL must amortize at least enough reserve amount to maintain its minimum authorized regulatory ROE and also may not amortize any reserve amount that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of its maximum authorized regulatory ROE.\n•\nFPL is authorized to expand SolarTogether\n®\n, a voluntary community solar program that gives FPL electric customers an opportunity to participate directly in the expansion of solar energy where participants pay a fixed monthly subscription charge and receive credits on their related monthly customer bill, by constructing an additional \n1,788\n MW of solar generation from 2022 through 2025, such that the total capacity of SolarTogether\n®\n would be \n3,278\n MW.\n•\nFuture storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning \n60\n days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $\n4\n for every \n1,000\n kilowatt-hour (kWh) of usage on residential bills during the first \n12\n months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $\n800\n million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $\n4\n surcharge. See Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery below.\n•\nIf federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the 2021 rate agreement, FPL will prospectively adjust base rates after a review by the FPSC. \nIn March 2024, the FPSC issued a supplemental final order regarding FPL's 2021 rate agreement. The order affirmed the FPSC's prior approval of the 2021 rate agreement and is intended to further document, as requested by the Florida Supreme Court, how the evidence presented led to and supports the FPSC's decision to approve FPL's 2021 rate agreement. In April 2024, Florida Rising, Inc., Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida, Inc. and League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida (collectively, the appellants) submitted a notice of appeal to the Florida Supreme Court regarding the FPSC's supplemental final order. The Florida Supreme Court issued an order granting FPL's motion to expedite the schedule. Oral arguments were held in October 2024, and the appeal remains pending.\nFPL 2025 Base Rate Proceeding\n – On December 30, 2024, FPL filed a formal notification with the FPSC indicating its intent to initiate a base rate proceeding by submitting a \nfour-year\n rate plan that would begin in January 2026 replacing the 2021 rate agreement. The notification states that, based on preliminary estimates, FPL expects to request a general base revenue requirement increase of approximately $\n1.55\n billion effective January 2026 and a subsequent increase of approximately $\n930\n million effective January 2027. The plan is also expected to request authority for a Solar and Battery Base Rate Adjustment mechanism to recover, subject to FPSC review, the revenue requirements associated with building and operating additional solar and battery storage projects in 2028 and 2029. In addition, FPL expects to propose an allowed regulatory ROE midpoint of \n11.90\n% and to incorporate the continued application of FPL's longstanding equity ratio approved in prior base rate cases. FPL expects to file its formal request to initiate a base rate proceeding on or around February 28, 2025.\n \nElectric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization\n – The cost of additions to units of property of FPL and NEER is added to electric plant in service and other property. In accordance with regulatory accounting, the cost of FPL's and NEER's rate-regulated transmission businesses' units of utility property retired, less estimated net salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs of property as well as replacements and renewals of items determined to be less than units of utility property are charged to other operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, as amended, provided for an option to elect a cash grant (convertible investment tax credits (ITCs)) for certain renewable energy property (renewable property). Convertible ITCs are recorded as a reduction in property, plant and equipment on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated life of the related property. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, convertible ITCs, net of amortization, were approximately $\n607\n million ($\n100\n million at FPL) and $\n633\n million ($\n106\n million at FPL).\nDepreciation of FPL's electric property is provided on a straight-line basis, primarily over its average remaining useful life. FPL includes in depreciation expense a provision for electric generation plant dismantlement, interim asset removal costs, accretion related to asset retirement obligations (see Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below) and storm recovery amortization. For substantially all of FPL's property, depreciation studies are performed periodically and filed with the FPSC which result in updated depreciation rates. Reserve amortization is recorded as either an increase or decrease to accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. FPL files a twelve-month forecast with the FPSC each year which contains a regulatory ROE intended to be earned based on the best information FPL has at that time assuming normal weather. This forecast establishes a targeted regulatory ROE. In order to earn the targeted regulatory ROE in each reporting period subject to the conditions of the \n72\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\neffective rate agreement, reserve amortization is calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items is adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization or its reversal to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. See Rate Regulation – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 above.\nNEER's electric plant in service and other property less salvage value, if any, are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. NEER reviews the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets on an ongoing basis. NEER's natural gas and oil production assets are accounted for under the successful efforts method. Depletion expenses for the acquisition of reserve rights and development costs are recognized using the unit of production method. Depreciation of NEER’s rate-regulated transmission assets are provided on a straight-line basis, primarily over their average remaining useful life. NEER includes in depreciation expense a provision for dismantlement, interim asset removal costs and accretion related to asset retirement obligations. For substantially all of NEER’s rate-regulated transmission assets, depreciation studies are performed periodically and filed with FERC which result in updated depreciation rates.\nNuclear Fuel\n – FPL and NEER have several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel. See Note 15 – Contracts. FPL's and NEER's nuclear fuel costs are charged to fuel expense on a unit of production method.\nConstruction Activity\n – Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) is a noncash item which represents the allowed cost of capital, including an ROE, used to finance construction projects. FPL records the portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds as a reduction of interest expense and the remainder as other income. FPSC rules limit the recording of AFUDC to projects that have an estimated cost in excess of \n0.4\n% of a utility's plant in service balance and require more than one year to complete. FPSC rules allow construction projects below the applicable threshold as a component of rate base. \nFPL's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, engineering costs, AFUDC and other costs directly associated with the construction of various projects. Upon completion of the projects, these costs are transferred to electric utility plant in service and other property. Capitalized costs associated with construction activities are charged to O&M expenses when recoverability is no longer probable. \nNEER capitalizes project development costs once it is probable that such costs will be realized through the ultimate construction of the related asset or sale of development rights. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, NEER's capitalized development costs totaled approximately $\n1.6\n billion and $\n1.5\n billion, respectively, which are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. These costs include land rights and other third-party costs directly associated with the development of a new project. Upon commencement of construction, these costs either are transferred to construction work in progress or remain in other assets, depending upon the nature of the cost. Capitalized development costs are charged to O&M expenses when it is probable that these costs will not be realized. \nNEER's construction work in progress includes construction materials, progress payments on major equipment contracts, third-party engineering costs, capitalized interest and other costs directly associated with the construction and development of various projects. Interest expense allocated from NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (NEECH) to NextEra Energy Resources is based on a deemed capital structure of \n70\n% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries. Upon commencement of project operation, costs associated with construction work in progress are transferred to electric plant in service and other property.\n \nAsset Retirement Obligations\n – NEE and FPL each account for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations (collectively, AROs) under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an ARO to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated, with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. NEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. See Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs below and Note 11.\nFor NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the asset retirement cost is allocated to a regulatory liability or regulatory asset using a systematic and rational method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the ARO and a decrease in the regulatory liability or regulatory asset. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original estimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO and asset retirement cost, or regulatory liability when asset retirement cost is depleted. \nFor NEE's non-rate regulated operations, the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the asset's estimated useful life. Changes in the ARO resulting from the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense, which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Changes resulting from revisions to the timing or amount of the original \n73\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nestimate of cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease in the ARO and asset retirement cost, or income when asset retirement cost is depleted.\nDecommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs\n – For ratemaking purposes, FPL accrues for the cost of end of life retirement and disposal of its nuclear and other generation plants over the expected service life of each unit based on nuclear decommissioning and other generation dismantlement studies periodically filed with the FPSC. In addition, FPL accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the FPSC. As approved by the FPSC, FPL previously suspended its annual nuclear decommissioning accrual. Any differences between expense recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount recovered through rates are reported as a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with regulatory accounting. See Rate Regulation, Electric Plant, Depreciation and Amortization, and Asset Retirement Obligations above and Note 11.\nNuclear decommissioning studies are performed at least every \nfive years\n and are filed with the FPSC for approval. FPL filed updated nuclear decommissioning studies with the FPSC in December 2020. These studies reflect, among other things, the expiration dates of the operating licenses for FPL's nuclear units at the time of the studies. The 2020 studies provide for the dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 following the end of plant operation with decommissioning activities commencing in 2052 and 2053, respectively; however, in 2022, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) amended Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 license renewals by removing the \n20\n additional years of operation reflected in the studies. FPL filed a site-specific environmental impact statement with the NRC related to the previously approved \n20-year\n renewal application for both Turkey Point operating licenses. Approval of the additional \n20\n years occurred in September 2024. The studies filed in 2020 also provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 in 2043. These studies also assume that FPL will be storing spent fuel on site pending removal to a United States (U.S.) government facility. FPL's portion of the ultimate costs of decommissioning its \nfour\n nuclear units, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $\n9.6\n billion, or $\n2.5\n billion expressed in 2024 dollars. The ultimate costs of decommissioning reflect the applications submitted to the NRC for the extension of St. Lucie Units Nos. 1 and 2 licenses for an additional \n20\n years.\nRestricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission FPL's nuclear units are included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in special use funds on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities held in the decommissioning funds are primarily carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses and estimated credit losses on debt securities, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding offset in the related regulatory asset or liability accounts. FPL does not currently make contributions to the decommissioning funds, other than the reinvestment of fund earnings. During 2024, 2023 and 2022 fund earnings on decommissioning funds were approximately $\n238\n million, $\n144\n million and $\n58\n million, respectively. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\nOther generation plant dismantlement studies are performed periodically and are submitted to the FPSC for approval. As part of the 2021 rate agreement, the FPSC approved an annual expense of $\n48\n million based on FPL's dismantlement studies which became effective January 1, 2022. At December 31, 2024, FPL's portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its other generation units is approximately $\n2.5\n billion, or $\n1.2\n billion expressed in 2024 dollars.\nNEER's AROs primarily include nuclear decommissioning liabilities for Seabrook Station (Seabrook), Duane Arnold Energy Center (Duane Arnold) and Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant (Point Beach) and dismantlement liabilities for its wind and solar facilities. The liabilities are being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning or dismantlement activities are expected to be complete. See Note 11. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, NEER's ARO was approximately $\n1.4\n billion and $\n1.3\n billion, respectively, and was determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning or dismantlement. NEER's portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants, including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the DOE under a spent fuel settlement agreement, is estimated to be approximately $\n9.8\n billion, or $\n2.2\n billion expressed in 2024 dollars. The ultimate cost to dismantle NEER's wind and solar facilities is estimated to be approximately $\n3.6\n billion.\nSeabrook files a comprehensive nuclear decommissioning study with the New Hampshire Nuclear Decommissioning Financing Committee (NDFC) every \nfour years\n; the most recent study was filed in 2023. Seabrook's decommissioning funding plan is also subject to annual review by the NDFC. Currently, there are no ongoing decommissioning funding requirements for Seabrook, Duane Arnold and Point Beach, however, the NRC, and in the case of Seabrook, the NDFC, has the authority to require additional funding in the future. NEER's portion of Seabrook's, Duane Arnold's and Point Beach's restricted funds for the payment of future expenditures to decommission these plants is included in nuclear decommissioning reserve funds, which are included in special use funds on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities held in the decommissioning funds are primarily carried at fair value. See Note 4. Market adjustments for debt securities result in a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income (OCI), except for estimated credit losses and unrealized losses on debt securities intended or \n74\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nrequired to be sold prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis, which are recognized in other – net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Market adjustments for equity securities are recorded in change in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds – net in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses are recognized in income and are reinvested in the funds. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes.\nMajor Maintenance Costs\n – FPL expenses costs associated with planned maintenance for its non-nuclear electric generation plants as incurred. FPL recognizes costs associated with planned major nuclear maintenance in accordance with regulatory treatment. FPL defers nuclear maintenance costs for each nuclear unit’s planned outage to a regulatory asset as the costs are incurred. FPL amortizes the costs to O&M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed. \nNEER uses the deferral method to account for certain planned major maintenance costs. NEER's major maintenance costs for its nuclear generation units, combustion turbines and battery storage are capitalized (included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets) and amortized to O&M expense using the straight-line method over the period from the end of the current outage to the next planned outage where the respective work scope is performed.\n \nCash Equivalents\n – Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of generally three months or less.\nRestricted Cash\n – At December 31, 2024 and 2023, NEE had approximately $\n159\n million ($\n101\n million for FPL) and $\n730\n million ($\n15\n million for FPL), respectively, of restricted cash, which, at December 31, 2024, was offset by $\n244\n million of cash received on exchange-traded derivative positions resulting in a balance of $(\n85\n) million. Restricted cash accounts are included in current other assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets and primarily relate to debt service payments and margin cash collateral requirements (funding) at NEER and bond proceeds held for construction at FPL. In addition, where offsetting positions exist, restricted cash related to margin cash collateral of $\n279\n million is netted against derivative assets at December 31, 2024 and $\n194\n million is netted against derivative assets and $\n815\n million is netted against derivative liabilities at December 31, 2023. See Note 3.\n \nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses\n – NEE, including FPL, follows the current expected credit loss model to account for credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes customer accounts receivable. FPL maintains an accumulated provision for uncollectible customer accounts receivable that is estimated using a percentage derived from historical revenue and write-off trends, adjusted for current events and forecasts. NEER regularly reviews collectibility of its receivables and establishes a provision for losses estimated as a percentage of accounts receivable based on the historical bad debt write-off trends, adjusted for current events and forecasts. When necessary, NEER uses the specific identification method for all other receivables.\n \nNEE's credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates using established standards and credit quality indicators such as credit ratings, certain financial ratios and delinquency trends. NEE requires credit enhancements or secured payment terms from customers who do not meet the minimum criteria.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, NEE recorded approximately $\n52\n million, $\n77\n million and $\n113\n million, respectively, of bad debt expense, including credit losses, which are included in O&M expenses in NEE’s consolidated statements of income.\n \nInventory\n – FPL values materials, supplies and fuel inventory using a weighted-average cost method. NEER's materials, supplies and fuel inventories, which include emissions allowances and renewable energy credits, are carried at the lower of weighted-average cost and net realizable value, unless evidence indicates that the weighted-average cost will be recovered with a normal profit upon sale in the ordinary course of business.\nEnergy Trading\n – NEE provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, which include load-following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to optimize the value of electricity and fuel contracts, generation facilities and natural gas and oil production assets, as well as to take advantage of projected favorable commodity price movements. Trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for at fair value and realized gains and losses from all trading contracts, including those where physical delivery is required, are recorded net for all periods presented. See Note 3.\nStorm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery\n – The storm funds provide coverage toward FPL's storm damage costs. Marketable securities held in the storm funds are carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of dividends, interest and realized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reinvested in the funds. Fund earnings, as well as any changes in unrealized gains and losses, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding adjustment to the storm reserve. The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes. The storm funds are included in special use funds and the storm reserves in noncurrent regulatory liabilities or, in the case of a deficit, in regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. \n75\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nIn December 2024, the FPSC approved FPL's request to begin a surcharge to recover eligible storm costs and replenish the storm reserve totaling approximately $\n1.2\n billion, related to Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton which impacted FPL's service area in 2024. The amount is being collected through an interim surcharge that will apply for a \n12-month\n period that began January 2025 and is subject to refund based on an FPSC prudence review. Recoverable storm costs are recorded as current regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. The unpaid portion of the storm restoration costs at December 31, 2024, of approximately $\n557\n million, including estimated capital costs, is included in current other liabilities on NEE’s and FPL’s 2024 consolidated balance sheet. \nDuring 2023, the FPSC approved FPL's request to recover eligible storm costs and replenishment of the storm reserve totaling approximately $\n1.3\n billion primarily related to Hurricanes Ian and Nicole which impacted FPL's service area in 2022. The amount was collected through an interim surcharge for a \n12-month\n period that concluded in March 2024\n. \nContract Assets\n – From time to time, NEER enters into agreements to build and sell renewable generation facilities and other assets to third parties. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, contract assets on NEE’s consolidated balance sheets primarily represent costs for such facilities and assets that are expected to be sold in less than 12 months.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n – \nNEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. \nThe impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset's fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate.\nImpairment of Equity Method Investments\n – NEE evaluates its equity method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value and the investment may be other than temporarily impaired (OTTI). An impairment loss is required to be recognized if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Investments that are OTTI are written down to their estimated fair value and cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value. Impairment losses are recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE’s consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n – \nNEE's goodwill and other intangible assets are as follows:\nWeighted-\nAverage\nUseful Lives\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(years)\n(millions)\nGoodwill (by reporting unit):\nFPL segment, primarily rate-regulated utilities \n$\n2,965\n \n$\n2,965\n \nNEER segment:\nRate-regulated assets, primarily transmission \n1,167\n \n1,218\n \nGas infrastructure\n(a)\n—\n \n487\n \nClean energy assets\n424\n \n315\n \nCustomer supply\n299\n \n95\n \nCorporate and Other\n11\n \n11\n \nTotal goodwill\n$\n4,866\n \n$\n5,091\n \nOther intangible assets not subject to amortization, primarily land easements\n$\n137\n \n$\n136\n \nOther intangible assets subject to amortization:\nPurchased power agreements (see Note 6)\n17\n$\n633\n \n$\n988\n \nBiogas rights agreements (see Note 6)\n28\n933\n \n531\n \nOther, primarily transportation contracts and customer lists\n19\n214\n \n187\n \nTotal\n1,780\n \n1,706\n \nAccumulated amortization\n(\n202\n)\n(\n150\n)\nTotal other intangible assets subject to amortization – net\n$\n1,578\n \n$\n1,556\n \n______________________\n(a)\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of selling ownership interests in certain natural gas and oil shale formations and in certain natural gas pipeline facilities (see Disposal of Businesses/Assets below), NEER reassessed and changed its reporting unit structure to no longer report gas infrastructure as a separate reporting unit.\n \nNEE's, including FPL's, goodwill relates to various acquisitions which were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Other intangible assets are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. NEE's other intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their estimated useful lives. Amortization of the other intangible assets was approximately $\n62\n million, $\n58\n million and $\n18\n million for the years ended \n76\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is expected to be approximately $\n55\n million, $\n54\n million, $\n50\n million, $\n46\n million and $\n45\n million for 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029, respectively. \nGoodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based analysis. Other intangible assets subject to amortization are periodically reviewed when impairment indicators are present to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted future cash flows.\nPension Plan\n – NEE records the service cost component of net periodic benefit income to O&M expense and the non-service cost component to other net periodic benefit income in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE allocates net periodic pension income to its subsidiaries based on the pensionable earnings of the subsidiaries' employees. Accounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment. See Note 12 – Employee Pension Plan and Other Benefits Plans.\nStock-Based Compensation\n – NEE accounts for stock-based payment transactions based on grant-date fair value. Compensation costs for awards with graded vesting are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Forfeitures of stock-based awards are recognized as they occur. See Note 14 – Stock-Based Compensation.\nRetirement of Long-Term Debt\n – For NEE's rate-regulated subsidiaries, including FPL, gains and losses that result from differences in reacquisition cost and the net book value of long-term debt which is retired are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability and amortized to interest expense ratably over the remaining life of the original issue, which is consistent with their treatment in the ratemaking process. NEE's non-rate regulated subsidiaries recognize such differences in interest expense at the time of retirement.\nStructured Payables\n – Under NEE's structured payables program, subsidiaries of NEE issue negotiable drafts, backed by NEECH guarantees, to settle invoices with suppliers with payment terms (on average approximately 90 days) that extend the original invoice due date (typically 30 days) and include a service fee. At their discretion, the suppliers may assign the negotiable drafts and the rights under the NEECH guarantees to financial institutions. NEE and its subsidiaries are not party to any contractual agreements between their suppliers and the applicable financial institutions.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, NEE's outstanding obligations under its structured payables program were approximately\n $\n4.0\n billion\n and \n$\n4.7\n billion\n, respectively, substantially all of which is included in \naccounts payable\n on NEE's consolidated balance sheets.\nA rollforward of NEE's structured payables is as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n(millions)\nObligations outstanding at the beginning of the year\n$\n4,701\n \nInvoices added to the program\n6,363\n \nInvoices paid\n(\n7,076\n)\nObligations outstanding at the end of the year\n$\n3,988\n \nIncome Taxes\n – Deferred income taxes are recognized on all significant temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are presented as noncurrent on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the tax sharing agreement between NEE and certain of its subsidiaries, the income tax provision at each applicable subsidiary reflects the use of the \"separate return method,\" except that tax benefits that could not be used on a separate return basis, but are used on the consolidated tax return, are recorded by the applicable subsidiary that generated the tax benefits. Any remaining consolidated income tax benefits or expenses are recorded at the corporate level. Included in other regulatory assets and other regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets is the revenue equivalent of the difference in deferred income taxes computed under accounting rules, as compared to regulatory accounting rules. The net regulatory liability totaled $\n2,916\n million ($\n2,880\n million for FPL) and $\n3,195\n million ($\n3,145\n million for FPL) at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is being amortized in accordance with the regulatory treatment over the estimated lives of the assets or liabilities for which the deferred tax amount was initially recognized.\nProduction tax credits (PTCs) are recognized as wind and solar energy is generated and sold based on a per kWh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes and are recorded as a reduction of current income taxes payable, unless \n77\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nlimited by tax law in which instance they are recorded as deferred tax assets. NEER recognizes ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense when the related energy property is placed into service. FPL recognizes ITCs as a reduction to income tax expense over the depreciable life of the related energy property. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, FPL’s accumulated deferred ITCs were approximately $\n966\n million and $\n997\n million, respectively, and are included in noncurrent regulatory liabilities on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. For taxable years beginning after 2022, renewable energy tax credits generated during the taxable year can be transferred to an unrelated purchaser for cash and are accounted for under \nAccounting Standards Codification 740 \n–\n Income Taxes\n. Proceeds resulting from the sales of renewable energy tax credits for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 of approximately $\n1,304\n million and $\n370\n million, respectively, are reported in the cash paid (received) for income taxes – net within the supplemental disclosures of cash flow information on NEE’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. NEE recognizes interest income (expense) related to unrecognized tax benefits (liabilities) in interest income and interest expense, respectively, net of the amount deferred at FPL. At FPL, the offset to accrued interest receivable (payable) on income taxes is classified as a regulatory liability (regulatory asset) which will be amortized to income (expense) over a \nfive-year\n period upon settlement in accordance with regulatory treatment. All tax positions taken by NEE in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not threshold. NEE and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states, the most significant of which is Florida, and certain foreign jurisdictions. Federal tax liabilities, with the exception of certain refund claims, are effectively settled for all years prior to 2019. State and foreign tax liabilities, which have varied statutes of limitations regarding additional assessments, are generally effectively settled for years prior to 2019. At December 31, 2024, NEE had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $\n130\n million that, if recognized, could impact the annual effective income tax rate. The amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest accruals may change within the next 12 months; however, NEE and FPL do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on NEE’s or FPL’s financial statements. See Note 5.\nNoncontrolling Interests\n \n–\n Noncontrolling interests represent the portions of net assets in consolidated entities that are not owned by NEE and are reported as a component of equity on NEE's consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024, noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets primarily reflects the interests related to differential membership interests discussed below, as well as other noncontrolling interests in certain wind and solar generation and transmission facilities sold to non-affiliated parties and XPLR Infrastructure Partners, LP (XPLR) (formerly NextEra Energy Partners, LP).\nCertain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have sold Class B noncontrolling membership interests in entities that have ownership interests in wind generation, solar generation and battery storage facilities, with generating/storage capacity in operation or under construction totaling approximately \n11,258\n MW, \n4,084\n MW and \n1,919\n MW, respectively, at December 31, 2024\n, to third-party investors (differential membership interests). The third-party investors are allocated earnings, tax attributes and cash flows in accordance with the respective limited liability company agreements. Those economics are allocated primarily to the third-party investors until they receive a targeted return (the flip date) and thereafter to NEE. NEE has the right to call the third-party interests at specified amounts if and when the flip date occurs. NEE has determined the allocation of economics between the controlling party and third-party investor should not follow the respective ownership percentages for each wind generation, solar generation and battery storage project but rather the hypothetical liquidation of book value (HLBV) method based on the governing provisions in each respective limited liability company agreement. Under the HLBV method, the amounts of income and loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest reflects changes in the amount the owners would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the respective liquidation provisions, assuming the net assets of these entities were liquidated at the recorded amounts, after taking into account any capital transactions, such as contributions and distributions, between the entities and the owners. At the point in time that the third-party investor, in hypothetical liquidation, would achieve its targeted return, NEE attributes the additional hypothetical proceeds to the differential membership interests based on the call price. A loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on NEE’s consolidated statements of income represents earnings attributable to NEE. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $\n9,062\n million and $\n8,857\n million, respectively, of noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets relates to differential membership interests. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, NEE recorded earnings of approximately $\n1,329\n million, $\n1,135\n million and $\n987\n million, respectively, associated with differential membership interests, which is reflected as net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated statements of income.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n – Certain subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold Class B noncontrolling membership interests in entities that have ownership interests in wind generation, as well as solar and solar plus battery storage facilities to third-party investors. As specified in the respective limited liability company agreements, if, subject to certain contingencies, certain events occur, including, among others, those that would delay completion or cancel any of the underlying projects, an investor has the option to require NEER to return all or part of its investment. As these potential redemptions were outside of NEER’s control, these balances were classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests on NEE's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. During 2024, the contingencies associated with the December 31, 2023 balance \n78\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nwere resolved and reclassified to noncontrolling interests. The contingencies associated with the December 31, 2024 balance are expected to be resolved in 2025.\n \nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs)\n – An entity is considered to be a VIE when its total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or its equity investors, as a group, lack the characteristics of having a controlling financial interest. A reporting company is required to consolidate a VIE as its primary beneficiary when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. NEE and FPL evaluate whether an entity is a VIE whenever reconsideration events as defined by the accounting guidance occur. See Note 9.\nLeases\n – NEE and FPL determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. NEE and FPL recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability for operating and finance leases by recognizing and measuring leases at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. For sales-type leases, the book value of the leased asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type lease is recognized based on fixed payments under the contract and the residual value of the asset being leased. NEE and FPL have elected not to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases and not to separate nonlease components from associated lease components for all classes of underlying assets except for purchased power agreements. ROU assets are includ\ned in\n noncurrent other assets, lease liabilities are included in current and noncurrent other liabilities and net investments in sales-type leases are included in current and noncurrent other assets on NEE’s and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease expense is included in O&M or fuel, purchased power and interchange expenses, interest and amortization expenses associated with finance leases are included in interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense, respectively, and rental income associated with operating leases and interest income associated with sales-type leases are included in operating revenues in NEE’s and FPL’s consolidated statements of income. See Note 10.\n \nDisposal of Businesses/Assets \n– In 2023, FPL sold its ownership interests in its Florida City Gas business for cash proceeds of approximately $\n924\n million. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $\n406\n million ($\n306\n million after tax at NEE and $\n300\n million after tax at FPL) was recorded in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023 and is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net. \nIn September 2024, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold \n100\n% ownership interests in certain natural gas and oil shale formations and, as part of a joint venture (pipeline joint venture), sold an ownership interest, representing an approximately \n15\n% economic interest, in \nthree\n natural gas pipeline facilities located in the southern U.S. for total cash proceeds of approximately $\n101\n million (subject to post-closing adjustments). A NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary has operated and continues to operate \ntwo\n of the pipeline facilities included in the sale. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $\n120\n million ($\n77\n million after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024 and is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net. Total assets of approximately $\n2,211\n million, primarily property, plant and equipment and investment in equity method investees, and total liabilities of approximately $\n1,833\n million, primarily long-term debt, were removed from NEE's balance sheet and an equity method investment of approximately $\n396\n million was recorded as a result of the transaction. NEE’s remaining interest, an approximately \n85\n% economic interest, in the pipeline joint venture is a noncontrolling interest based on the governance structure of the joint venture. The fair value of NEE’s retained interest was calculated based on significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 (unobservable) inputs. Estimates and assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows, discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future cash flows and future market prices.\nIn September 2024, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold an ownership interest, representing an approximately \n65\n% economic interest, as part of a joint venture (renewable assets joint venture), consisting of a portfolio of \nfive\n wind generation facilities and \nthree\n solar generation facilities located in geographically diverse locations throughout the U.S. with a total generating capacity of \n1,634\n MW, for cash proceeds of approximately $\n900\n million. A NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary continues to operate the facilities included in the sale. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $\n103\n million ($\n76\n million after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024 and is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net. Total assets of approximately $\n2,520\n million, primarily property, plant and equipment, and total noncontrolling interests of approximately $\n844\n million were removed from NEE's balance sheet and an equity method investment of approximately $\n831\n million was recorded as a result of the transaction. NEE’s remaining interest, an approximately \n35\n% economic interest, in the renewable assets joint venture is a noncontrolling interest based on the governance structure of the joint venture. Upon the projects in the renewable assets joint venture obtaining financing in the fourth quarter of 2024, NEE received a distribution of approximately $\n386\n million. The fair value of NEE’s retained interest was calculated based on significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 (unobservable) inputs. Estimates and assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows, discount rates reflecting risk inherent in future cash flows and future market prices. \nIn 2023, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold to an XPLR subsidiary their \n100\n% ownership interests in \nfive\n wind generation facilities and \nthree\n solar generation facilities located in geographically diverse locations throughout the U.S. with a \n79\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ntotal generating capacity of \n688\n MW for cash proceeds of approximately $\n566\n million, plus working capital of $\n32\n million. A NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary continues to operate the facilities included in the sale.\nIn 2022, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold (i) a \n49\n% controlling ownership interest in \nthree\n wind generation facilities and \none\n solar plus battery facility located in geographically diverse locations throughout the U.S. with a total generating capacity of \n1,437\n MW and \n65\n MW of battery storage capacity, two of which facilities were under construction, and (ii) their \n100\n% ownership interest in \nthree\n wind generation facilities located in the Midwest region of the U.S. with a total generating capacity of \n347\n MW to an XPLR subsidiary for cash proceeds of approximately $\n805\n million, plus working capital and other adjustments of $\n8\n million. NEER continued to consolidate one of the projects under construction for accounting purposes through March 2023 and the second project under construction through July 2023. A NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary continues to operate the facilities included in the sale. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $\n301\n million ($\n230\n million after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022 and is included in the gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net. In connection with the two facilities that were under construction, approximately $\n251\n million of cash received was recorded as contract liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheet. The contract liabilities related to sale proceeds from XPLR of approximately $\n150\n million and differential membership interests of approximately $\n101\n million. In 2023, the two facilities achieved commercial operations and approximately $\n251\n million of contract liabilities were reversed and the sale of those facilities was recognized for accounting purposes. In addition, NextEra Energy Resources was responsible to pay for all construction costs related to the portfolio. At December 31, 2023, approximately $\n68\n million was included in accounts payable on NEE's consolidated balance sheet and represented amounts owed by NextEra Energy Resources to XPLR to reimburse XPLR for construction costs.\nIn 2022, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold to an XPLR subsidiary a \n67\n% controlling ownership interest in a battery storage facility in California with storage capacity of \n230\n MW, for cash proceeds of approximately $\n191\n million, plus working capital and other adjustments of $\n2\n million. A NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary continues to operate the facility included in the sale. In connection with the sale, a gain of approximately $\n87\n million ($\n66\n million after tax) was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022 and is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net.\nIn 2021, subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources sold their \n100\n% ownership interest, comprised of a \n50\n% controlling ownership interest to an XPLR subsidiary and a \n50\n% noncontrolling ownership interest to a third party, in a portfolio of \nseven\n wind generation facilities and \nsix\n solar generation facilities in geographically diverse locations throughout the U.S. representing a total generating capacity of \n2,520\n MW and \n115\n MW of battery storage capacity, three of which facilities were under construction. Total cash proceeds for these two separate transactions totaled approximately $\n1.7\n billion. NEER continued to consolidate the three projects under construction for accounting purposes through the first quarter of 2022. A NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary continues to operate the facilities included in the sales. In connection with the three facilities that were under construction, approximately $\n668\n million of cash received was recorded as contract liabilities on NEE’s consolidated balance. Upon the three facilities achieving commercial operations and the resolution of contingencies, the contract liabilities were reversed and the sale of those facilities was recognized for accounting purposes. In addition, a gain of approximately $\n117\n million was recorded in NEE's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022 which is included in gains on disposal of businesses/assets – net.\n \n \n2. \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The promised goods or services in the majority of NEE’s contracts with customers is, at FPL, for the delivery of electricity based on tariff rates approved by the FPSC and, at NEER, for the delivery of energy commodities and the availability of electric capacity and electric transmission.\nFPL and NEER generate substantially all of NEE’s operating revenues, which primarily include revenues from contracts with customers, as well as derivative (see Note 3) and lease transactions at NEER. For the vast majority of contracts with customers, NEE believes that the obligation to deliver energy, capacity or transmission is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits as NEE performs. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, NEE’s revenue from contracts with customers was approximately $\n23.5\n billion ($\n16.9\n billion at FPL), $\n24.8\n billion ($\n18.2\n billion at FPL) and $\n23.0\n billion ($\n17.2\n billion at FPL), respectively. NEE's and FPL's receivables are primarily associated with revenues earned from contracts with customers, as well as derivative and lease transactions at NEER, and consist of both billed and unbilled amounts, which are recorded in customer receivables and other receivables on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. Receivables represent unconditional rights to consideration and reflect the differences in timing of revenue recognition and cash collections. For substantially all of NEE's and FPL's receivables, regardless of the type of revenue transaction from which the receivable originated, customer and counterparty credit risk is managed in the same manner and the terms and conditions of payment are similar. \n80\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nFPL\n – FPL’s revenues are derived primarily from tariff-based sales that result from providing electricity to retail customers in Florida with no defined contractual term. Electricity sales to retail customers account for approximately \n90\n% of FPL’s 2024 operating revenues, the majority of which are to residential customers. FPL’s retail customers receive a bill monthly based on the amount of monthly kWh usage with payment due monthly. For these types of sales, FPL recognizes revenue as electricity is delivered and billed to customers, as well as an estimate for electricity delivered and not yet billed. The billed and unbilled amounts represent the value of electricity delivered to the customer. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, FPL's unbilled revenues amounted to approximately $\n573\n million and $\n633\n million, respectively, and are included in customer receivables on NEE’s and FPL’s consolidated balance sheets. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price with maturity dates through 2054. As of December 31, 2024, FPL expects to record approximately\n \n$\n590\n million\n of revenues related to the fixed price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts. Certain of these contracts also contain a variable price component for energy usage which FPL recognizes as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts. \nNEER\n – NEER’s revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity and electric transmission. For these types of sales, NEER recognizes revenue as energy commodities are delivered and as electric capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed. The amounts billed and accrued represent the value of energy or transmission delivered and/or the capacity of energy or transmission available to the customer. Revenues yet to be earned under these contracts, which have maturity dates ranging from \n2025 to 2055,\n will vary based on the volume of energy or transmission delivered and/or available. NEER’s customers typically receive bills monthly with payment due within 30 days. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to electric capacity sales through \n2038 and certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates through\n \n2036\n. At December 31, 2024, NEER expects to record approximately $\n800\n million of revenues related to the fixed price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided. The power purchase agreements also contain a variable price component for energy usage which NEER recognizes as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.\n \n3. \nDerivative Instruments\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and natural gas and oil production assets. NEE and FPL do not utilize hedge accounting for their cash flow and fair value hedges.\nWith respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and natural gas and oil production assets, providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets. These risk management activities involve the use of derivative instruments executed within prescribed limits to manage the risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices. Transactions in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via the over-the-counter markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power generation and natural gas and oil production assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these assets. These hedges are designed to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity markets associated with NEER's power generation and natural gas and oil production assets. With regard to full energy and capacity requirements services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served. For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these customers and reduce the effect of unfavorable changes in the forward energy markets. Additionally, NEER takes positions in energy markets based on differences between actual forward market levels and management's view of fundamental market conditions, including supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy, changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes. NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.\nDerivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause). For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the consolidated statements of income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income. For commodity \n81\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nderivatives, NEE believes that, where offsetting positions exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted and therefore physical delivery has been deemed not to have occurred for financial reporting purposes. Settlements related to derivative instruments are substantially all recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated debt, are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n At December 31, 2024, NEE's AOCI included immaterial amounts related to discontinued interest rate cash flow hedges with expiration dates through October 2033 and foreign currency cash flow hedges with expiration dates through September 2030. \nFair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments\n – The fair value of assets and liabilities are determined using either unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) or other pricing inputs that are observable (Level 2) whenever that information is available and using unobservable inputs (Level 3) to estimate fair value only when relevant observable inputs are not available. NEE and FPL use different valuation techniques to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities, relying primarily on the market approach of using prices and other market information for identical and/or similar assets and liabilities for those assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. NEE's and FPL's assessment of the significance of any particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. Non-performance risk, including the consideration of a credit valuation adjustment, is also considered in the determination of fair value for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\nNEE and FPL measure the fair value of commodity contracts using a combination of market and income approaches utilizing prices observed on commodities exchanges and in the non-exchange traded markets, or through the use of industry-standard valuation techniques, such as option modeling or discounted cash flows techniques, incorporating both observable and unobservable valuation inputs. The resulting measurements are the best estimate of fair value as represented by the transfer of the asset or liability through an orderly transaction in the marketplace at the measurement date.\nExchange-traded derivative assets and liabilities are valued using observable settlement prices from the exchanges and are classified as Level 1 or Level 2, depending on whether positions are in active or inactive markets.\nNEE, through its subsidiaries, including FPL, also enters into non-exchange traded commodity derivatives. The majority of the valuation inputs are observable using exchange-quoted prices.\nNEE, through NEER, also enters into full requirements contracts, which, in most cases, meet the definition of derivatives and are measured at fair value. These contracts typically have one or more inputs that are not observable and are significant to the valuation of the contract. In addition, certain non-exchange traded derivative options at NEE have one or more significant inputs that are not observable, and are valued using industry-standard option models.\nIn all cases where NEE and FPL use significant unobservable inputs for the valuation of a commodity contract, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. The primary input to the valuation models for commodity contracts is the forward commodity curve for the respective instruments. Other inputs include, but are not limited to, assumptions about market liquidity, volatility, correlation and contract duration as more fully described below in Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements. In instances where the reference markets are deemed to be inactive or do not have transactions for a similar contract, the derivative assets and liabilities may be valued using significant other observable inputs and potentially significant unobservable inputs. In such instances, the valuation for these contracts is established using techniques including extrapolation from or interpolation between actively traded contracts, or estimated basis adjustments from liquid trading points. NEE and FPL regularly evaluate and validate the inputs used to determine fair value by a number of methods, consisting of various market price verification procedures, including the use of pricing services and broker quotes to support the market price of the various commodities. Where there are assumptions and models used to generate inputs for valuing derivative assets and liabilities, the review and verification of the assumptions and models are undertaken by individuals in an independent control function.\nNEE uses interest rate contracts and foreign currency contracts to mitigate and adjust interest rate and foreign currency exchange exposure related primarily to certain outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings when deemed appropriate based on market conditions or when required by financing agreements. NEE estimates the fair value of these derivatives using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing the net amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the agreements\n.\n82\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

These amounts are included in current other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets.\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements\n – The valuation of certain commodity contracts requires the use of significant unobservable inputs. All forward price, implied volatility, implied correlation and interest rate inputs used in the valuation of such contracts are directly based on third-party market data, such as broker quotes and exchange settlements, when that data is available. If third-party market data is not available, then industry standard methodologies are used to develop inputs that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs, including some forward prices, implied volatilities and interest rates used for determining fair value are updated daily to reflect the best available market information. Unobservable inputs which are related to observable inputs, such as illiquid portions of forward price or volatility curves, are updated daily as well, using industry standard techniques such as interpolation and extrapolation, combining observable forward inputs supplemented by historical market and other relevant data. Other unobservable inputs, such as implied correlations, block-to-hourly price shaping, customer migration rates from full \n84\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\n – Certain derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features including, among other things, the requirement to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified credit rating agencies and certain financial ratios, as well as credit-related cross-default and material adverse change triggers. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate fair value of NEE's derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was approximately $\n3.8\n billion ($\n11\n million for FPL) and $\n4.7\n billion ($\n14\n million for FPL), respectively.\nIf the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these derivative agreements were triggered, certain subsidiaries of NEE, including FPL, could be required to post collateral or settle contracts according to contractual terms which generally allow netting of contracts in offsetting positions. Certain derivative contracts contain multiple types of credit-related triggers. To the extent these contracts contain a credit ratings downgrade trigger, the maximum exposure is included in the following credit ratings collateral posting requirements. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to BBB/Baa2 (a three level downgrade for FPL and a one level downgrade for NEECH from the current lowest applicable rating), applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately $\n500\n million (\nnone\n at FPL) and $\n510\n million (\nnone\n at FPL) at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post additional collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately $\n2.4\n billion ($\n25\n million at FPL) and $\n2.4\n billion ($\n15\n million at FPL) at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Some derivative contracts do not contain credit ratings downgrade triggers, but do contain provisions that require certain financial measures be maintained and/or have credit-related cross-default triggers. In the event these provisions were triggered, applicable NEE subsidiaries could be required to post additional collateral of up to approximately $\n1.4\n billion ($\n70\n million at FPL) and $\n1.7\n billion ($\n50\n million at FPL) at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCollateral related to derivatives, including amounts posted for margin, current exposures and future performance with exchanges and independent system operators, may be posted in the form of cash or credit support in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, applicable NEE subsidiaries have posted approximately $\n19\n million (\nnone\n at FPL) and $\n691\n million (\nnone\n at FPL), respectively, in cash and $\n1,334\n million (\nnone\n at FPL) and $\n1,595\n million (\nnone\n at FPL), respectively, in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds each of which could be applied toward the collateral requirements described above. FPL and NEECH have capacity under their credit facilities generally in excess of the collateral requirements described above that would be available to support, among other things, derivative activities. Under the terms of the credit facilities, maintenance of a specific credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities, although there are other conditions to drawing on these credit facilities.\nAdditionally, some contracts contain certain adequate assurance provisions whereby a counterparty may demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions. Due to the subjective nature of these provisions, NEE and FPL are unable to determine an exact value for these items and they are not included in any of the quantitative disclosures above.\n4. \nNon-Derivative Fair Value Measurements\nNon-derivative fair value measurements consist of NEE’s and FPL’s cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents, special use funds and other investments. The fair value of these financial assets is determined by using the valuation techniques and inputs as described in Note 3 – Fair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments as well as below.\nCash Equivalents\n \nand Restricted Cash Equivalents \n– NEE and FPL hold investments primarily in money market funds. The fair value of these funds is estimated using a market approach based on current observable market prices.\nSpecial Use Funds and Other Investments \n– NEE and FPL hold primarily debt and equity securities directly, as well as indirectly through commingled funds. Substantially all directly held equity securities are valued at their quoted market prices. For directly held debt securities, multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue of each security. Commingled funds, which are similar to mutual funds, are maintained by banks or investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of objectives. The fair value of commingled funds is primarily derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities.

The FERC regulations prohibit, among other investments, investments in any securities of NEE or its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates, excluding investments tied to market indices or mutual funds. Similar restrictions applicable to the decommissioning funds for NEER's nuclear plants are included in the NRC operating licenses for those facilities or in NRC regulations applicable to NRC licensees not in cost-of-service environments. With respect to the decommissioning fund for Seabrook, decommissioning fund contributions and withdrawals are also regulated by the NDFC pursuant to New Hampshire law.\nThe nuclear decommissioning reserve funds are managed by investment managers who must comply with the guidelines of NEE and FPL and the rules of the applicable regulatory authorities. The funds' assets are invested giving consideration to taxes, liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements \n– NEE tests its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value. Indicators of impairment may include, among other things, an observable market price below NEE’s carrying value. Investments that are OTTI are written down to their estimated fair value on the reporting date and an impairment loss is recognized.\nNextEra Energy Resources owns a noncontrolling interest in XPLR, primarily through its limited partner interest in XPLR Infrastructure Operating Partners, LP (XPLR OpCo), and accounts for this ownership interest as an equity method investment. During the preparation of NEE’s December 31, 2024 financial statements, it was determined that NextEra Energy Resources’ investment in XPLR was OTTI as a result of a significant decline in trading price of XPLR's common units. The impairment reflected NEE’s fair value analysis using the market approach and the observable trading price of XPLR’s common units at December 31, 2024 of $\n17.80\n. When making the OTTI determination, NEE considered, among other things, the extent to which the publicly traded unit price was less than cost. Based on the fair value analysis, the equity method investment with a carrying amount of approximately $\n2.6\n billion was written down to its estimated fair value of approximately $\n1.8\n billion, resulting in an impairment charge of $\n0.8\n billion ($\n0.6\n billion after tax), which is recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024. In January 2025, XPLR announced a strategic repositioning, including suspension of the distribution to common unitholders for an indefinite period. This has resulted in the trading price of XPLR's common units to trade below the December 31, 2024 trading price. Should NEE determine, based on future analysis which includes the current and future trading prices of XPLR's common units, that an additional impairment is other-than-temporary, an impairment loss would be recorded, which would impact NEE's consolidated statement of income.\nDuring the preparation of NEE’s September 30, 2023 financial statements, it was determined that NextEra Energy Resources’ investment in XPLR was OTTI as a result of a significant decline in trading price of XPLR's common units during the final three trading days of the third quarter of 2023 following the announcement of a decrease in XPLR’s distribution growth rate expectations. The impairment reflected NEE’s fair value analysis using the market approach and the observable trading price of XPLR’s common units at September 30, 2023 of $\n29.70\n. When making the OTTI determination, NEE considered, among other things, the extent to which the publicly traded unit price was less than cost. Based on the fair value analysis, the equity method investment with a carrying amount of approximately $\n4.2\n billion was written down to its estimated fair value of approximately $\n3.0\n billion, resulting in an impairment charge of $\n1.2\n billion ($\n0.9\n billion after tax), which is recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nDuring the first quarter of 2022, NextEra Energy Resources recorded an impairment charge of approximately $\n0.8\n billion ($\n0.6\n billion after tax) related to an investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (Mountain Valley Pipeline), which is reflected in \nequity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees\n in NEE’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impairment reflected NextEra Energy Resources’ fair value analysis based on the market approach and considered legal and regulatory challenges to the completion of construction and the resulting economic outlook for the pipeline. This impairment charge resulted in the complete write off of NextEra Energy Resources’ equity method investment carrying \n91\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\namount as of March 31, 2022 of approximately $\n0.6\n billion, as well as the recording of a liability of approximately $\n0.2\n billion which reflected NextEra Energy Resources’ share of estimated future dismantlement costs.\nThe Mountain Valley Pipeline fair value estimate was based on a probability-weighted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple valuation technique using a market participant view of the potential different outcomes for the investment. As part of the valuation, NextEra Energy Resources used observable inputs where available, including the EBITDA multiples of recent pipeline transactions. Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), including the probabilities assigned to the different potential outcomes, the forecasts of operating revenues and costs, and the projected capital expenditures to complete the project, were also used in the estimation of fair value. An increase in the revenue forecasts, a decrease in the projected operating or capital expenditures or an increase in the probability assigned to the full pipeline being completed would result in an increased fair market value. Changes in the opposite direction of those unobservable inputs would result in a decreased fair market value.\n5. \nIncome Taxes\nThe components of income taxes are as follows:\nNEE\nFPL\nYears Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(millions)\nFederal:\nCurrent\n$\n208\n \n$\n507\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n252\n \n$\n990\n \n$\n3\n \nDeferred\n(\n150\n)\n368\n \n497\n \n422\n \n(\n179\n)\n684\n \nTotal federal\n58\n \n875\n \n508\n \n674\n \n811\n \n687\n \nState:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCurrent\n126\n \n161\n \n41\n \n116\n \n294\n \n2\n \nDeferred\n155\n \n(\n30\n)\n37\n \n180\n \n18\n \n258\n \nTotal state\n281\n \n131\n \n78\n \n296\n \n312\n \n260\n \nTotal income taxes\n$\n339\n \n$\n1,006\n \n$\n586\n \n$\n970\n \n$\n1,123\n \n$\n947\n \nA reconciliation between the effective income tax rates and the applicable statutory rate is as follows:\n \nNEE\nFPL\n \nYears Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStatutory federal income tax rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nIncreases (reductions) resulting from:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nState income taxes – net of federal income tax benefit\n3.7\n \n1.4\n \n1.6\n \n4.3\n \n4.3\n \n4.4\n \nTaxes attributable to noncontrolling interests\n4.3\n \n3.0\n \n4.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nRenewable energy tax credits\n(\n19.9\n)\n(\n8.3\n)\n(\n6.8\n)\n(\n4.3\n)\n(\n2.0\n)\n(\n1.1\n)\nAmortization of deferred regulatory credit\n(\n2.7\n)\n(\n2.5\n)\n(\n4.8\n)\n(\n3.0\n)\n(\n3.2\n)\n(\n4.0\n)\nOther – net\n(\n0.8\n)\n(\n0.8\n)\n(\n0.6\n)\n(\n0.4\n)\n(\n0.3\n)\n0.1\n \nEffective income tax rate\n5.6\n \n%\n13.8\n \n%\n15.3\n \n%\n17.6\n \n%\n19.8\n \n%\n20.4\n \n%\n92\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

The portfolio primarily consisted of \n31\n biogas projects, \none\n of which is an operating renewable natural gas facility and the others of which are primarily operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities. The purchase price included approximately $\n1.1\n billion in cash consideration and the assumption of approximately $\n34\n million of debt, excluding post-closing adjustments.\nUnder the acquisition method, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value. NEE acquired identifiable assets of approximately $\n1.3\n billion, primarily relating to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets associated with biogas rights agreements and above-market purchased power agreements, and assumed liabilities of approximately $\n0.3\n billion and noncontrolling interests of approximately $\n0.1\n billion. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in approximately $\n0.3\n billion of goodwill which has been recognized on NEE's consolidated balance sheets, of which approximately $\n0.2\n billion is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill associated with the RNG acquisition is reflected within NEER and, for impairment testing, is included in the clean energy assets reporting unit. The goodwill arising from the transaction represents expected benefits of synergies and expansion opportunities for NEE's clean energy businesses.\n \n \n7. \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consists of the following at December 31:\nNEE\nFPL\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n(millions)\nElectric plant in service and other property\n$\n151,677\n \n$\n139,049\n \n$\n87,596\n \n$\n79,801\n \nNuclear fuel\n1,676\n \n1,564\n \n1,140\n \n1,125\n \nConstruction work in progress\n21,658\n \n18,652\n \n7,214\n \n8,311\n \nProperty, plant and equipment, gross\n175,011\n \n159,265\n \n95,950\n \n89,237\n \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n(\n36,159\n)\n(\n33,489\n)\n(\n19,784\n)\n(\n18,629\n)\nProperty, plant and equipment – net\n$\n138,852\n \n$\n125,776\n \n$\n76,166\n \n$\n70,608\n \nFPL\n – At December 31, 2024, FPL's gross investment in electric plant in service and other property for the electric generation, transmission, distribution and general facilities of FPL represented approximately \n43\n%, \n14\n%, \n36\n% and \n7\n%, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were \n43\n%, \n14\n%, \n36\n% and \n7\n%. Substantially all of FPL's properties are subject to the lien of FPL's mortgage, which secures most debt securities issued by FPL. The weighted annual composite depreciation and amortization rate for FPL's electric plant in service, including capitalized software, but excluding the effects of decommissioning, dismantlement and the depreciation adjustments discussed in the following sentences, was approximately \n3.5\n%, \n3.4\n% and \n3.6\n% for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In accordance with the 2021 rate agreement (see Note 1 – Rate Regulation – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025), FPL recorded reserve amortization in 2024 and 2023 of approximately $\n328\n million and $\n227\n million, respectively. In 2022, FPL recorded a one-time reserve amortization adjustment of approximately $\n114\n million, as required under the 2021 rate agreement, 50% of which was used to reduce the capital recovery regulatory asset balance and the other 50% to increase the storm reserve regulatory liability (see Note 1 – Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery). During 2024, 2023 and 2022, FPL recorded AFUDC of approximately $\n245\n million, $\n190\n million and $\n136\n million, respectively, including the equity component of AFUDC of approximately $\n189\n million, $\n155\n million and $\n105\n million, respectively. \nNEER\n – At December 31, 2024, wind, solar, nuclear and rate-regulated transmission facilities represented approximately \n45\n%, \n23\n%, \n6\n% and \n5\n%, respectively, of NEER's depreciable electric plant in service and other property; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were \n47\n%, \n18\n%, \n6\n% and \n6\n%. The estimated useful lives of NEER's plants are primarily \n30\n to \n35\n years for wind facilities, \n30\n to \n35\n years for solar facilities, \n23\n to \n47\n years for nuclear facilities and \n40\n years for rate-regulated transmission facilities. NEER's natural gas and oil production assets represented approximately \n15\n% and \n16\n% of NEER's depreciable electric plant in service and other property at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A number of NEER's generation and regulated transmission facilities are encumbered by liens securing various financings. The net book value of NEER's assets serving as collateral was approximately $\n30.1\n billion at December 31, 2024. Interest capitalized on construction projects amounted to approximately $\n439\n million, $\n310\n million and $\n172\n million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n94\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

In addition, approximately $\n0.3\n billion in 2024 and $\n1.1\n billion in 2023 is associated with XPLR. The difference for 2024 reflects the approximately $\n0.8\n billion impairment charge in 2024 related to NextEra Energy Resources' investment in XPLR. See Note 4 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.\nThrough XPLR OpCo, XPLR owns, or has a partial ownership interest in, a portfolio of contracted renewable energy assets consisting of wind, solar and battery storage projects as well as a\n contracted natural gas pipeline\n. NEE has an approximately \n95\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n52.6\n% noncontrolling interest in XPLR, primarily through its limited partner interest in XPLR OpCo, and accounts for its ownership interest in XPLR as an equity method investment. NextEra Energy Resources operates essentially all of the energy projects owned by XPLR and provides services to XPLR under various related party operations and maintenance, administrative and management services agreements (service agreements). NextEra Energy Resources is also party to a cash sweep and credit support (CSCS) agreement with a subsidiary of XPLR. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cash sweep amounts (due to XPLR and its subsidiaries) held in accounts belonging to NextEra Energy Resources or its subsidiaries were approximately $\n127\n million and $\n1,511\n million, respectively, and are included in accounts payable. Fee income related to the CSCS agreement and the service agreements totaled approximately $\n18\n million, $\n59\n million and $\n174\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included in operating revenues in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Amounts due from XPLR of approximately $\n159\n million and $\n84\n million are included in other receivables and $\n128\n million and $\n114\n million are included in noncurrent other assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. NEECH or NextEra Energy Resources guaranteed or provided indemnifications, letters of credit or surety bonds totaling approximately $\n1.3\n billion at December 31, 2024 primarily related to obligations on behalf of XPLR's subsidiaries with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2059, including certain project performance obligations and obligations under financing and interconnection agreements. Payment guarantees and related contracts with respect to unconsolidated entities for which NEE or one of its subsidiaries are the guarantor are recorded on NEE’s consolidated balance sheets at fair value. At December 31, 2024, approximately $\n58\n million related to the fair value of the credit support provided under the CSCS agreement is recorded as noncurrent other liabilities on NEE's consolidated balance sheet.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, certain services, primarily engineering, construction, transportation, storage and maintenance services, were provided to subsidiaries of NEE by related parties that NEE accounts for under the equity method of accounting. Charges for these services amounted to approximately $\n749\n million, $\n656\n million and $\n579\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n9. \nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nNEER\n – At December 31, 2024, NEE consolidates a number of VIEs within the NEER segment. Subsidiaries within the NEER segment are considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since they control the most significant activities of these VIEs, including operations and maintenance, and they have the obligation to absorb expected losses of these VIEs.\nEight\n indirect subsidiaries of NextEra Energy Resources have an ownership interest ranging from approximately \n50\n% to \n67\n% in entities which own and operate solar generation facilities with generating capacity of approximately \n765\n MW. Each of the subsidiaries is considered a VIE since the non-managing members have no substantive rights over the managing members, and is consolidated by NextEra Energy Resources. These entities sell their electric output to third parties under power sales contracts with expiration dates ranging from 2035 through 2052. These entities have third-party debt which is secured by liens against the assets of the entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs were approximately $\n1,708\n million and $\n520\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. There were \neight\n of these consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2023 and the assets and liabilities of those VIEs at such date totaled approximately $\n1,796\n million and $\n1,085\n million, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets and liabilities of these VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and long-term debt.\nNextEra Energy Resources consolidates a VIE which has a \n10\n% direct ownership interest in wind and solar generation facilities which have the capability of producing approximately \n400\n MW and \n599\n MW, respectively. These entities sell their electric output under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2025 through 2040. These entities are also considered a VIE because the holders of differential membership interests in these entities do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities. The assets and liabilities of the VIE were approximately $\n1,346\n million and $\n76\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024, and $\n1,434\n million and $\n79\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets of this VIE consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment.\nNextEra Energy Resources consolidates \n30\n VIEs that primarily relate to certain subsidiaries which have sold differential membership interests in entities which own and operate wind generation, solar generation and battery storage facilities with generating/storage capacity of approximately \n10,446\n MW, \n3,485\n MW and \n1,719\n MW, respectively, and own wind generation and battery storage facilities that, upon completion of construction, which is anticipated in 2025, are expected to have generating/storage capacity of approximately \n412\n MW and \n200\n MW, respectively. These entities sell, or will sell, their electric output either under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2025 through 2054 or in the spot market. These entities are considered VIEs because the holders of differential membership interests do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities. NextEra Energy Resources has financing obligations with respect to these entities, including third-party debt which is secured by liens against the generation facilities and the other assets of these entities or by pledges of NextEra Energy Resources' ownership interest in these entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs totaled approximately $\n23,902\n million and $\n1,546\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. There were \n33\n of these consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2023 and the assets and liabilities of those VIEs at such date totaled approximately $\n24,250\n million and $\n3,148\n \n96\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nmillion, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the assets and liabilities of these VIEs consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment and accounts payable.\nOther\n – At December 31, 2024 and 2023, several NEE subsidiaries had investments totaling approximately $\n5,848\n million ($\n4,506\n million at FPL) and $\n4,962\n million ($\n3,899\n million at FPL), respectively, which are included in special use funds and noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheets and in special use funds on FPL's consolidated balance sheets. These investments represented primarily commingled funds and asset-backed securities. NEE subsidiaries, including FPL, are not the primary beneficiaries and therefore do not consolidate any of these entities because they do not control any of the ongoing activities of these entities, were not involved in the initial design of these entities and do not have a controlling financial interest in these entities.\nCertain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's noncontrolling interest in XPLR OpCo (see Note 8). These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered VIEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE’s investment in these entities totaled approximately $\n3,315\n million and $\n3,913\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $\n175\n million in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 15 – Commitments and – Contracts, respectively.\n10. \nLeases\nNEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to land use agreements that convey exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy projects and substations, as well as buildings and equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2083, with the exception of operating leases related to \nthree\n land use agreements with an expiration date of 2106, some of which include options to extend the leases up to \n34\n years and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. At December 31, 2024, NEE’s \nROU assets\n and \nlease liabilities\n for operating leases totaled approximately $\n372\n million and $\n387\n million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $\n396\n million and $\n412\n million. At December 31, 2024, NEE’s \nROU assets\n and \nlease liabilities\n for finance leases totaled approximately $\n826\n million and $\n840\n million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $\n440\n million and $\n444\n million. NEE’s lease liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were calculated using a weighted-average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of \n3.83\n% and \n3.96\n%, respectively, for operating leases and \n4.92\n% and \n4.32\n%, respectively, for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of \n44\n years and \n44\n years, respectively, for operating leases and \n33\n years and \n32\n years, respectively, for finance leases. At December 31, 2024, expected lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $\n2.6\n billion with no one year being material. Operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented.\nNEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to certain battery storage facilities and a natural gas and oil electric generation facility that sell their electric output under power sales agreements to third parties which provide the customers the ability to dispatch the facilities. At December 31, 2024, the power sales agreements have expiration dates from 2026 to 2044 and NEE expects to receive approximately $\n3.9\n billion of lease payments over the remaining terms of the power sales agreements with no one year being material. Operating and sales-type lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or balance sheets for the periods presented.\n11. \nAsset Retirement Obligations\nNEE's AROs relate primarily to decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities. For NEE's rate-regulated operations, including FPL, the accounting provisions result in timing differences in the recognition of legal asset retirement costs for financial reporting purposes and the method the regulator allows for recovery in rates. See Note 1 – Rate Regulation and – Decommissioning of Nuclear Plants, Dismantlement of Plants and Other Accrued Asset Removal Costs.\n97\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

The related ARO liability is not estimable for such easements as NEE and FPL intend to use these properties indefinitely. In the event NEE or FPL decide to abandon or cease the use of a particular easement, an ARO liability would be recorded at that time.\n12. \nEmployee Retirement Benefits \nEmployee Pension Plan and Other Benefits Plans\n – NEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. NEE also has a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP), which includes a non-qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees, and sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for other benefits for retirees of NEE and its subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements. The total accrued benefit cost of the SERP and postretirement plans is approximately $\n212\n million ($\n86\n million for FPL) and $\n231\n million ($\n101\n million for FPL) at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n98\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

Upon exchange, NEECH will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes being exchanged and has the right, at its sole discretion, to pay or deliver cash, shares of NEE common stock or a combination of both, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEECH's exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being exchanged. At December 31, 2024, the exchange rate, which is subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the indenture, is 14.6927 shares of NEE common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $\n68.06\n per share of NEE common stock.\nNEECH used $\n52\n million of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to enter into capped call transactions. Under the capped call transactions, NEECH purchased capped call options with an initial strike price of $\n68.06\n and an initial cap price of $\n83.34\n in each case per share of NEE common stock and subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The capped call transactions may be settled with cash or, at NEE's election, with shares of NEE common stock. Any capped call settlement value is expected to offset the value to be delivered upon exchange of the notes as a result of share price improvement up to the cap price. \nIn September 2022, NEE sold $\n2.0\n billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $\n50\n and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially, a \n5\n% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series M Debenture due September 1, 2027, issued in the principal amount of $\n1,000\n by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than September 1, 2025 (the final settlement date) for a price of $\n50\n in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments) based on a price per share range described in the following sentence. If purchased on the final settlement date, as of December 31, 2024, the number of shares issued per equity unit would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from \n0.5670\n shares if the applicable market value of a share of NEE common stock is less than or equal to $\n88.88\n (the reference price) to \n0.4534\n shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than $\n111.10\n (the threshold appreciation price), with the applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a \n20\n-day trading period ending August 27, 2025. Total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of \n6.926\n%, consisting of interest on the debentures (\n4.60\n% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (\n2.326\n% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after March 1, 2025. A holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the NEECH debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure the holder's obligation to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract. If a successful remarketing does not occur on or before the third business day prior to the final settlement date, and a holder has not notified NEE of its intention to settle the stock purchase \n103\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE. \nIn June 2024, NEE sold $\n2.0\n billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $\n50\n and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially, a \n5\n% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series N Debenture due June 1, 2029, issued in the principal amount of $\n1,000\n by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than June 1, 2027 (the final settlement date) for a price of $\n50\n in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments), based on a price per share range described in the following sentence. If purchased on the final settlement date, as of December 31, 2024, the number of shares issued per equity unit would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from \n0.6915\n shares if the applicable market value of a share of NEE common stock is less than or equal to $\n72.31\n (the reference price) to \n0.5532\n shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than $\n90.38\n (the threshold appreciation price), with the applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a \n20\n-day trading period ending on May 26, 2027. Total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of \n7.299\n%\n, consisting of interest on the debentures (\n5.15\n% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (\n2.149\n% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after December 1, 2026.\n A holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the NEECH debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure the holder's obligation to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract. If a successful remarketing does not occur on or before the third business day prior to the final settlement date, and a holder has not notified NEE of its intention to settle the stock purchase contract with cash, the debentures that are components of the Corporate Units will be used to satisfy in full the holders' obligations to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contracts on the final settlement date. The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.\nIn October 2024, NEE sold $\n1.5\n billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $\n50\n and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially, a \n5\n% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series O Debenture due November 1, 2029, issued in the principal amount of $\n1,000\n by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than November 1, 2027 (the final settlement date) for a price of $\n50\n in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments), based on a price per share range described in the following sentence. If purchased on the final settlement date, as of December 31, 2024, the number of shares issued per equity unit would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from \n0.6034\n shares if the applicable market value of a share of NEE common stock is less than or equal to $\n82.87\n (the reference price) to \n0.4827\n shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than $\n103.58\n (the threshold appreciation price), with the applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a \n20\n-day trading period ending on October 27, 2027. Total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of \n7.234\n%\n, consisting of interest on the debentures (\n4.635\n% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (\n2.599\n% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after May 1, 2027.\n A holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the NEECH debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure the holder's obligation to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract.

The debentures are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by NEE.\nPrior to the issuance of NEE’s common stock, the stock purchase contracts, if dilutive, will be reflected in NEE’s diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of NEE common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued upon settlement of the stock purchase contracts over the number of shares that could be purchased by NEE in the market, at the average market price during the period, using the proceeds receivable upon settlement.\nOn February 4, 2025, NEECH sold a total of $\n4.5\n billion principal amount of its fixed-rate debentures, with interest rates ranging from \n4.85\n% to \n5.90\n% and maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2055, and $\n500\n million of its floating-rate debentures due in 2028.\nOn February 6, 2025, NEECH sold $\n1.5\n billion principal amount of its Series S Junior Subordinated Debentures due August 15, 2055 and $\n1.0\n billion principal amount of its Series T Junior Subordinated Debentures due August 15, 2055, bearing interest at a rate of \n6.375\n% to August 15, 2030 and \n6.50\n% to August 15, 2035, respectively, and thereafter will bear interest based on an underlying index plus a specified margin, reset every \nfive years\n, provided that the interest rate will not be lower than the respective initial interest rate.\n104\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

FPL's mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.\nStock-Based Compensation\n – Net income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 includes approximately $\n138\n million, $\n139\n million and $\n142\n million, respectively, of compensation costs and $\n29\n million, $\n26\n million and $\n20\n million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was not material. At December 31, 2024, there were approximately $\n207\n million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n2.0\n years.\nAt December 31, 2024, approximately \n68\n million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors of NEE and its subsidiaries under NEE's: (a) 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan, (b) 2017 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan and (c) earlier equity compensation plans under which shares are reserved for issuance under existing grants, but \nno\n additional shares are available for grant under the earlier plans. NEE satisfies restricted stock and performance share awards by issuing new shares of its common stock or by purchasing shares of its common stock in the open market. NEE satisfies stock option exercises by issuing new shares of its common stock. NEE generally grants most of its stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year.\nRestricted Stock and Performance Share Awards\n \n– Restricted stock typically vests within \nthree years\n after the date of grant and is subject to, among other things, restrictions on transferability prior to vesting. The fair value of restricted stock is measured based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant. Performance share awards are typically payable at the end of a \nthree-year\n performance period if the specified performance criteria are met. The fair value for the majority of performance share awards is estimated based upon the closing market price of NEE common stock as of the date of grant less the present value of expected dividends, multiplied by an estimated performance multiple which is subsequently trued up based on actual performance.\n105\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

These obligations primarily related to guaranteeing the residual value of certain financing leases and obligations under purchased power agreements. Payment guarantees and related contracts with respect to unconsolidated entities for which NEE or one of its subsidiaries are the guarantor are recorded at fair value and are included in noncurrent other liabilities on NEE’s consolidated balance sheets.

The charges associated with these agreements are recoverable through the fuel clause and totaled approximately $\n409\n million, $\n417\n million and $\n418\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which $\n73\n million, $\n99\n million and $\n102\n million, respectively, were eliminated in consolidation at NEE.    \n(b)\nIncludes approximately $\n175\n million of commitments to invest in technology and other investments through 2031. See Note 9 – Other.\n(c)\nIncludes approximately $\n870\n million and $\n40\n million for 2025 and 2026, respectively, of joint obligations of NEECH and NEER.\nInsurance\n – Liability for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this Act, NEE maintains $\n500\n million of private liability insurance per site, which is the maximum obtainable, except at Duane Arnold which obtained an exemption from the NRC and maintains a $\n100\n million private liability insurance limit. Each site, except Duane Arnold, participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides up to $\n15.8\n billion of liability insurance coverage per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments of up to $\n1,161\n million ($\n664\n million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S., payable at a rate not to exceed $\n173\n million ($\n99\n million for FPL) per incident per year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $\n20\n million and $\n25\n million, plus any applicable taxes, per incident, respectively.\nNEE participates in a nuclear insurance mutual company, Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), which provides property damage, nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each plant for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear facilities, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. Additionally, NEIL provides accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage at an insured nuclear plant. Pursuant to regulations of the NRC, each company’s property damage insurance policies provide that all proceeds from such insurance be applied first to place the plant in a safe and stable condition after a qualifying accident, and second, to decontaminate the plant before any proceeds can be used for decommissioning, plant repair or restoration.\nNEE and FPL nuclear facilities each have accident property damage, nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning liability insurance from NEIL with limits of $\n1.5\n billion, except for Duane Arnold which has a limit of $\n50\n million due to being in a deferred decommissioning. All the nuclear facilities, except for Duane Arnold, also share an additional $\n1.25\n billion nuclear accident insurance limit above their dedicated underlying limit. This shared additional excess limit is not subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss. All coverages are subject to sublimits and deductibles.\nNEE also participates in an insurance program that provides limited coverage for replacement power costs if a nuclear plant is out of service for an extended period of time because of an accident. In the event of an accident at one of NEE's or another participating insured's nuclear plants, NEE could be assessed up to $\n167\n million ($\n104\n million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, in retrospective premiums in a policy year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane Arnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $\n3\n million, $\n2\n million and $\n4\n million, plus any applicable taxes, respectively.\nDue to the high cost and limited coverage available from third-party insurers, NEE does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of either its transmission and distribution property or natural gas pipeline assets. If FPL's storm restoration costs exceed the storm reserve, such storm restoration costs may be recovered, subject to prudence review by the FPSC, through surcharges approved by the FPSC or through securitization provisions pursuant to Florida law. See Note 1 – Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.\nIn the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers in the case of FPL, would be borne by NEE and FPL and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n109\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC. AND FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nLegal Proceedings –\n FPL is the defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in the Miami-Dade County Circuit Court in February 2018 that seeks from FPL unspecified damages for alleged breach of contract and gross negligence based on service interruptions that occurred as a result of Hurricane Irma in 2017. A class previously had been certified that encompassed all persons and business owners who reside in and are otherwise citizens of the state of Florida that contracted with FPL for electrical services, were charged storm charges, experienced a power outage after Hurricane Irma and suffered consequential damages because of FPL’s alleged breach of contract or gross negligence. Florida's Third District Court of Appeal (3rd DCA) reconsidered and revoked its previous order approving certification of the class and remanded and stayed the case unless and until the plaintiffs take action at the FPSC regarding FPL's actions during Hurricane Irma. In December 2024, the Florida Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' request to review the 3rd DCA's order.\nNEE, FPL, and certain current and former executives, are the named defendants in a purported shareholder securities class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in June 2023 and amended in December 2023 that seeks from the defendants unspecified damages allegedly resulting from alleged false or misleading statements regarding NEE's alleged campaign finance and other political activities. The alleged class of plaintiffs are all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired NEE securities between December 2, 2021 and January 30, 2023. In September 2024, the class action lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. In October 2024, the lead plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. NEE is vigorously defending against the claims in this proceeding.\nNEE, along with certain current and former executives and directors are the named defendants in purported shareholder derivative actions filed in the 15th Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach County, Florida in July 2023 and March 2024, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in October 2023 and November 2023 (which were consolidated in January 2024) and in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in July 2024 seeking unspecified damages allegedly resulting from, among other things, breaches of fiduciary duties and, in the consolidated cases and the July 2024 case, violations of the federal securities laws, all purporting to relate to alleged campaign finance law violations and associated matters. The defendants are vigorously defending against the claims in these proceedings. NEE and the plaintiffs in the derivative actions have agreed to a specified stay. NEE also has received demand letters and books and records requests from counsel representing other purported shareholders and containing similar allegations. These demands seek, among other things, a Board of Directors investigation of, and/or documentation regarding, these allegations. NEE and certain of the shareholders demanding an investigation have agreed to a specified stay of all material activities related to the demand.\nIn September 2023, a participant in the NEE Employee Retirement Savings Plan (Plan), purportedly on behalf of the Plan and all persons who were participants in or beneficiaries of the Plan, at any time between September 25, 2016 and September 25, 2023 (Plan participants), filed a putative ERISA class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against NEE. The complaint alleges that NEE violated its fiduciary duties under the Plan by permitting a third-party administrative recordkeeper to charge allegedly excessive fees for the services provided and allegedly by allowing a large volume of plan assets to be invested in NEE common stock. The plaintiff seeks declaratory, equitable and monetary relief on behalf of the Plan and Plan participants. NEE and the plaintiff have agreed to a specified stay of the action to permit the plaintiff to exhaust the administrative remedies available under the Plan.\nIn November 2024, NEE was named as defendant in an antitrust lawsuit (Avangrid, Inc. et al. v. NextEra Energy, Inc.) filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. This lawsuit seeks damages of $\n350\n million, which are tripled in the event of a finding of monopolization under the Sherman Act, from the defendants for alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws, as well as Massachusetts state laws. In January 2025, NEE filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to transfer venue. NEE does not believe that it should have any liability with respect to the claims in this matter.\n16. \nSegment Information\nEffective January 1, 2024, NEE and FPL adopted an accounting standards update that provides guidance on segment reporting and requires additional disclosures related to significant segment expenses and increases the frequency of segment reporting to interim periods (updated segment standard). NEE and FPL adopted the updated segment standard using the full retrospective approach, which changed the presentation of the segment information below.\nThe tables below present information for NEE's \ntwo\n reportable segments, FPL, a rate-regulated utility business, and NEER, which is comprised of competitive energy and rate-regulated transmission businesses. Corporate and Other represents other business activities, includes eliminating entries, and may include the net effect of rounding. FPL has a single reportable segment. See Note 2 for information regarding NEE's and FPL's operating revenues.\nNEE's and FPL's chief operating decision maker (CODM) is NEE's chief executive officer. The CODM makes key operating decisions and evaluates the reportable segment's operating results, including net income attributable to NEE, for financial planning, analysis of performance and resource allocation.\n110\nTable of Contents\nNEXTERA ENERGY, INC.

These fees primarily relate to audits of subsidiary financial statements and financial systems pre-implementation internal control assessment.\n(c)\nTax fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. These fees primarily relate to research and development tax credit advice and planning services.\n(d)\nAll other fees consist of fees for products and services other than the services reported under the other named categories. In 2024, these fees relate to training, and in 2023, these fees relate to training and advisory services for IT job architecture and skills descriptions.\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Audit Committee Charter and the Audit Committee's pre-approval policy for services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, all services performed by Deloitte & Touche are approved in advance by the Audit Committee, except for audits of certain trust funds where the fees are paid by the trust. Permitted services specifically identified in an appendix to the pre-approval policy are pre-approved by the Audit Committee each year. This pre-approval allows management to request the specified permitted services on an as-needed basis during the year, provided any such services are reviewed with the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Any permitted service for which the fee is expected to exceed $500,000, or that involves a service not listed on the pre-approval list, must be specifically approved by the Audit Committee prior to commencement of such service. The Audit Committee has delegated to the Chair of the committee the right to approve audit, audit-related, tax and other services, within certain limitations, between meetings of the Audit Committee, provided any such decision is presented to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. At each Audit Committee meeting (other than meetings held to review earnings materials), the Audit Committee reviews a schedule of services for which Deloitte & Touche has been engaged since the prior Audit Committee meeting under existing pre-approvals and the estimated fees for those services. In 2024 and 2023, none of the amounts presented above represent services provided to NEE or FPL by Deloitte & Touche that were approved by the Audit Committee after services were rendered pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X (which provides for a waiver of the otherwise applicable pre-approval requirement if certain conditions are met).\n116\nTable of Contents\n \nPART IV\nItem 15.  Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\nPage(s)\n(a)\n1.\nFinancial Statements\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n57\nAttestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n58\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID \n34\n)\n59\nNEE:\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n61\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n62\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n63\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n64\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\n65\nFPL:\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n66\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n67\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n68\nConsolidated Statements of Common Shareholder's Equity\n69\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n70\n – \n113\n2.\nFinancial Statement Schedules – Schedules are omitted as not applicable or not required.\n3.\nExhibits (including those incorporated by reference)\nCertain exhibits listed below refer to \"FPL Group\" and \"FPL Group Capital,\" and were effective prior to the change of the name FPL Group, Inc. to NextEra Energy, Inc., and of the name FPL Group Capital Inc to NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc., during 2010.\nExhibit\nNumber\nDescription\nNEE\nFPL\n*3(i)a\nRestated Articles of Incorporation of NextEra Energy, Inc.
