We generate revenue from both resilient sources (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and non-recurring sources, including commissions generated by transactions. Our revenue mix has become more weighted towards resilient revenue sources, particularly occupier outsourcing, and our dependence on cyclical property sales and lease transaction revenue has declined. Non-recurring transactional revenue and earnings within our Advisory Services segment (notably property sales and leasing) have historically been highest in the year’s fourth quarter due to a focus on completing transactions prior to year-end, but such seasonality has decreased as transactions have comprised a smaller proportion of our total revenue.\nBusiness Environment\nThe operating environment for commercial real estate improved in 2024, particularly in the second half of the year. This was most prominently evident in real estate leasing markets. A healthy economic outlook and improved return-to-office momentum made companies increasingly confident to move forward with office leasing plans. Demand was particularly strong for the highest-quality space and expanded from primary to secondary markets as the year progressed. Improved capital availability and lower borrowing costs – along with the perception that interest rates would fall further – buoyed investor sentiment and led to increased real estate sales and financing activity in the second half of 2024. These factors also improved the operating backdrop for development and investment asset sales late in the year. Meanwhile, outsourcing services continued to gain favor with major corporations and other large occupiers of space, boosting demand for facilities and project management services. \nResults of Operations\nThe following presents highlights of CBRE’s performance for the year ended December 31, 2024 (percentages represent comparison to 2023 results):\nRevenue\nNet Revenue \n(1)\nGAAP Net Income\n$35.8B\n$20.9B\n$968M\n12.0%\n14.2%\n(1.8)%\nCore EBITDA \n(1)\nGAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS)\nCore EPS \n(1)\n$2.7B\n$3.14\n$5.10\n22.4%\n(0.3)%\n32.8%\nAn improved operating environment supported strong growth for CBRE in 2024. Overall, net revenue increased 14.2%. This included 14.1% net revenue growth in our resilient businesses\n(1)\n (including facilities management, project management, property management, loan servicing, recurring investment management fees and valuations), and 14.3% net revenue growth in our transactional businesses\n(1)\n (property sales, leasing, mortgage origination, carried interest and incentive fees in our investment management business, and development fees).\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures section in Item 7 of this Annual Report.\nWe allocated significant capital last year on projects designed to enhance our capabilities, augment our growth profile and expand our total addressable market. Our capital deployment totaled approximately $1.8 billion, and included $1.1 billion in M&A and other strategic investments, including the acquisition of J&J Worldwide Services, a provider of outsourcing \n29\nTable of Contents\nservices to the U.S. federal government and Direct Line Global, which provides technical data center management. In addition, we deployed $644 million in share buybacks (repurchasing 5,110,624 shares). \nThe following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nRevenue:\nNet revenue:\nFacilities management\n$\n6,907 \n19.3 \n%\n$\n5,806 \n18.2 \n%\nProperty management\n2,123 \n5.9 \n%\n1,840 \n5.8 \n%\nProject management\n3,433 \n9.6 \n%\n3,124 \n9.8 \n%\nValuation\n751 \n2.1 \n%\n716 \n2.2 \n%\nLoan servicing\n331 \n0.9 \n%\n317 \n1.0 \n%\nAdvisory leasing\n3,932 \n11.0 \n%\n3,503 \n11.0 \n%\nCapital markets:\nAdvisory sales\n1,774 \n5.0 \n%\n1,611 \n5.0 \n%\nCommercial mortgage origination\n596 \n1.7 \n%\n424 \n1.3 \n%\nInvestment management\n650 \n1.8 \n%\n592 \n1.9 \n%\nDevelopment services\n388 \n1.1 \n%\n360 \n1.1 \n%\nCorporate, other and eliminations\n(17)\n0.0 \n%\n(17)\n(0.1)\n%\nTotal net revenue\n20,868 \n58.3 \n%\n18,276 \n57.2 \n%\nPass-through costs also recognized as revenue\n14,899 \n41.7 \n%\n13,673 \n42.8 \n%\nTotal revenue\n35,767 \n100.0 \n%\n31,949 \n100.0 \n%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue\n28,811 \n80.6 \n%\n25,675 \n80.4 \n%\nOperating, administrative and other\n5,011 \n14.0 \n%\n4,562 \n14.3 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n674 \n1.9 \n%\n622 \n1.9 \n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n34,496 \n96.4 \n%\n30,859 \n96.6 \n%\nGain on disposition of real estate\n142 \n0.4 \n%\n27 \n0.1 \n%\nOperating income\n1,413 \n4.0 \n%\n1,117 \n3.5 \n%\nEquity (loss) income from unconsolidated subsidiaries\n(19)\n(0.1)\n%\n248 \n0.8 \n%\nOther income\n39 \n0.1 \n%\n61 \n0.2 \n%\nInterest expense, net of interest income\n215 \n0.6 \n%\n149 \n0.5 \n%\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n1,218 \n3.4 \n%\n1,277 \n4.0 \n%\nProvision for income taxes\n182 \n0.5 \n%\n250 \n0.8 \n%\nNet income\n1,036 \n2.9 \n%\n1,027 \n3.2 \n%\nLess: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n68 \n0.2 \n%\n41 \n0.1 \n%\nNet income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc.\n$\n968 \n2.7 \n%\n$\n986 \n3.1 \n%\n30\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nWe reported consolidated net income of $968 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 on revenue of $35.8 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $986 million on revenue of $31.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe revenue increase reflected growth in leasing activity, particularly for office and retail space, commercial mortgage origination, loan servicing, property management, and continued strong growth in the GWS segment, which benefited from strong new business activity, contract expansions, and acquisitions. We began to see an increase in property sales in our Advisory Services segment in the second half of 2024. Revenue increased in the REI segment, driven by higher incentive and development fees.\nForeign currency translation had minimal net impact on revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024. Foreign currency translation strength in the British pound sterling was offset by weakness in the Japanese yen.\nCost of revenue increased 12.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to revenue growth, consisting of higher pass-through costs, higher compensation, and higher indirect reimbursed costs. Foreign currency translation had a 0.1% positive impact on total cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased slightly to 80.6% of total revenue from 80.4% driven by higher costs to support growth in revenues. \nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased 9.8% as compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by an increase in restructuring and indirect tax expenses this year compared to 2023 as the cost savings initiatives in the GWS segment were largely completed. Foreign currency translation had a 0.1% positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2024. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 14.0% from 14.3%, as operating expenses grew slower than revenue. \nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by 8.4% during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting higher depreciation and amortization expense related to assets acquired from recent acquisitions such as J&J Worldwide Services.\nGain on disposition of real estate increased by $115 million in 2024, driven by the monetization of real estate development assets in the REI segment.\nWe incurred an equity loss of $19 million in 2024 compared to equity income of $248 million in the same period in 2023. This was mainly due to an unusually large development asset disposition in the first-quarter 2023 that did not recur in 2024. In addition, we recorded higher unrealized net losses related to our non-core strategic equity investments, including Altus Power, Inc. (Altus), during the year ended December 31, 2024. These losses were partially offset by equity income recognized in relation to investments in TCC real estate development projects.\nOther income decreased to $39 million from $61 million, driven primarily by a one-time gain of approximately $34 million recognized in 2023 associated with the remeasurement of an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary to fair value as of the date the remaining controlling interest was acquired. This decrease was partially offset by positive fair value adjustments on certain financial instruments this year as compared to the same period last year. \nInterest expense, net of interest income, increased 44.3% in 2024 as compared to the same period 2023. This increase was primarily due to the issuance of new debt during the first quarter of 2024, the impact of higher interest rates, and increased borrowings on the revolving credit and commercial paper facilities.\nOur provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $250 million in 2023. Our effective tax rate decreased to 15.0% in 2024 from 19.5% in 2023. The decrease is primarily related to the reversal of unrecognized tax positions.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD) Pillar Two Model Rules established a minimum global effective tax rate of 15% on country-by-country profits of large multinational companies. European Union member states along with many other countries adopted or expect to adopt the OECD Pillar Two Model effective January 1, 2024 or thereafter. The OECD and other countries continue to publish guidelines and legislation which include transition and safe harbor rules. We continue to monitor new legislative changes and assess the global impact of the Pillar Two Model Rules. The impact of Pillar Two top-up taxes was insignificant for 2024.\n31\nTable of Contents\nSegment Operations\nAs of December 31, 2024, our operations were organized around, and we publicly report financial results for, three global business segments: (1) Advisory Services; (2) Global Workplace Solutions; and (3) Real Estate Investments. We also have a Corporate and Other segment. For additional information on our segments, see Note 19 – Segments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIn early January 2025, we combined our project management business with our Turner & Townsend majority-owned subsidiary and will publicly report financial results for a fourth business segment, Project Management, beginning in the first quarter of 2025. In addition, we acquired full ownership of Industrious, a provider of premium flexible workplace solutions in January 2025, and will establish a new business segment, Building Operations & Experience, in 2025, comprised of enterprise and local facilities management, property management and flexible workplace solutions. Our four business segments beginning in 2025 will be (1) Advisory Services; (2) Building Operations & Experience; (3) Project Management; and (4) Real Estate Investments.\nAdvisory Services\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for our Advisory Services operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nRevenue:\nNet revenue:\nProperty management\n$\n2,123 \n22.1 \n%\n$\n1,840 \n21.7 \n%\nValuation\n751 \n7.8 \n%\n716 \n8.4 \n%\nLoan servicing\n331 \n3.4 \n%\n317 \n3.7 \n%\nAdvisory leasing\n3,932 \n40.9 \n%\n3,503 \n41.2 \n%\nCapital markets:\nAdvisory sales\n1,774 \n18.5 \n%\n1,611 \n19.0 \n%\nCommercial mortgage origination\n596 \n6.2 \n%\n424 \n5.0 \n%\nTotal segment net revenue\n9,507 \n99.0 \n%\n8,411 \n99.0 \n%\nPass-through costs also recognized as revenue\n99 \n1.0 \n%\n88 \n1.0 \n%\nTotal segment revenue\n9,606 \n100.0 \n%\n8,499 \n100.0 \n%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue\n5,858 \n61.0 \n%\n5,147 \n60.6 \n%\nOperating, administrative and other\n2,099 \n21.9 \n%\n2,076 \n24.4 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n272 \n2.8 \n%\n289 \n3.4 \n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n8,229 \n85.7 \n%\n7,512 \n88.4 \n%\nOperating income\n1,377 \n14.3 \n%\n987 \n11.6 \n%\nEquity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries\n1 \n0.0 \n%\n4 \n0.0 \n%\nOther income\n5 \n0.1 \n%\n46 \n0.5 \n%\nAdd-back: Depreciation and amortization\n272 \n2.8 \n%\n289 \n3.4 \n%\nAdjustments:\nCosts associated with efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives\n40 \n0.4 \n%\n72 \n0.9 \n%\nOne-time gain associated with remeasuring an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary to fair value as of the date the remaining controlling interest was acquired\n— \n0.0 \n%\n(34)\n(0.4)\n%\nSegment operating profit and segment operating profit on revenue margin\n$\n1,695 \n17.6 \n%\n$\n1,364 \n16.0 \n%\nSegment operating profit on net revenue margin\n17.8 \n%\n16.2 \n%\n32\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nRevenue increased 13.0% in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Global leasing revenue rose 12.2% driven by the Americas which grew 13.3%, including 15.8% in the United States, APAC which grew 10.6% and the United Kingdom, which grew 10.5%. Property sales revenue was up 10.1%, reflecting an increase in property sales in the second half of 2024. The company’s loan origination business benefited from higher loan fees, partially offset by a decrease in interest earnings on escrow balances. Property management also grew solidly, up 15.4%, fueled by growth across regions and in the U.S. and continued growth from the Brookfield portfolio. Foreign currency translation had a 0.2% negative impact on total revenue in 2024, primarily driven by weakness in the Japanese yen and Brazilian real, partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling.\nCost of revenue increased 13.8%, primarily reflecting business growth, higher reimbursable expenses in property management, higher professional compensation and higher commission expense. Foreign currency translation had a 0.1% positive impact on cost of revenue. Cost of revenue slightly increased to 61.0% of total revenue from 60.6% for the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher commissions, driven by revenue growth.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses slightly increased by 1.1%, in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, driven by higher variable employee compensation costs. The increase was partially offset by lower restructuring expenses as the Advisory Services segment recorded significant restructuring expenses in the first half of 2023, as the segment went through cost reduction initiatives that did not recur this year. Foreign currency translation had a 0.2% positive impact on total operating expenses.\nIn connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on the date the loans are sold. Upon origination of a mortgage loan held for sale, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights to be retained is included in the forecasted proceeds from the anticipated loan sale and results in a net gain (which is reflected in revenue). Our MSRs are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized in proportion to and over the period that the servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows and assessed for impairment based on the fair value each reporting period. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, MSRs contributed $123 million to operating income, offset by $138 million of amortization of related intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2023, MSRs contributed $84 million to operating income, offset by $144 million of amortization of related intangible assets. The increase was associated with higher origination activity given an increase in financing activities in the second half of 2024.\nOther income was $5 million in 2024 versus $46 million in 2023. In 2023, we recognized a one-time gain of approximately $34 million associated with remeasuring an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary to fair value as of the date the remaining controlling interest was acquired.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased 5.9% primarily due to lower amortization of mortgage servicing rights as described above and due to accelerated depreciation expense recorded in the first half of 2023, as part of cost savings initiatives that did not recur this year.\n33\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Workplace Solutions\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for our Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nRevenue:\nNet revenue:\nFacilities management\n$\n6,907 \n27.5 \n%\n$\n5,806 \n25.8 \n%\nProject management\n3,433 \n13.7 \n%\n3,124 \n13.9 \n%\nTotal segment net revenue\n10,340 \n41.1 \n%\n8,930 \n39.7 \n%\nPass-through costs also recognized as revenue\n14,800 \n58.9 \n%\n13,585 \n60.3 \n%\nTotal segment revenue\n25,140 \n100.0 \n%\n22,515 \n100.0 \n%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue\n22,703 \n90.3 \n%\n20,345 \n90.4 \n%\nOperating, administrative and other\n1,327 \n5.3 \n%\n1,242 \n5.5 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n332 \n1.3 \n%\n262 \n1.2 \n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n24,362 \n96.9 \n%\n21,849 \n97.1 \n%\nOperating income\n778 \n3.1 \n%\n666 \n2.9 \n%\nEquity (loss) income from unconsolidated subsidiaries\n(3)\n0.0 \n%\n1 \n0.0 \n%\nOther income\n3 \n0.0 \n%\n2 \n0.0 \n%\nAdd-back: Depreciation and amortization\n332 \n1.3 \n%\n262 \n1.2 \n%\nAdjustments:\nIntegration and other costs related to acquisitions\n17 \n0.1 \n%\n23 \n0.1 \n%\nCosts associated with efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives\n65 \n0.3 \n%\n52 \n0.3 \n%\nImpact of fair value non-cash adjustments related to unconsolidated equity investments\n9 \n0.0 \n%\n— \n0.0 \n%\nSegment operating profit and segment operating profit on revenue margin\n$\n1,201 \n4.8 \n%\n$\n1,006 \n4.5 \n%\nSegment operating profit on net revenue margin\n11.6 \n%\n11.3 \n%\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nRevenue increased 11.7% in 2024 as compared to 2023, reflecting a double-digit increase in facilities management, led by the Enterprise and Local business, and growth in project management due to continued strong growth from Turner & Townsend. Foreign currency translation had minimal net impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024. Foreign currency translation weakness in the Japanese yen was partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling.\nCost of revenue increased 11.6%, driven by higher pass-through costs, higher indirect reimbursed costs, and increased professional compensation to support the growth in the business. Foreign currency translation had a 0.1% positive impact on total cost of revenue. Cost of revenue was 90.3% of total revenue, a slight decrease from 90.4% in 2023.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased 6.8%, primarily due to restructuring charges incurred related to cost savings initiatives and the inclusion of J&J Worldwide Services’ operating results since acquisition at the end of February 2024. Foreign currency translation had minimal net impact on total operating expenses in 2024.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased 26.7%, primarily due to increased amortization expense on intangibles related to the J&J Worldwide Services and certain other in-fill acquisitions. \n34\nTable of Contents\nReal Estate Investments\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for our Real Estate Investments (REI) operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nRevenue:\nInvestment management\n$\n650 \n62.6 \n%\n$\n592 \n62.1 \n%\nDevelopment services\n388 \n37.4 \n%\n360 \n37.9 \n%\nTotal segment revenue\n1,038 \n100.0 \n%\n952 \n100.0 \n%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue\n224 \n21.6 \n%\n186 \n19.5 \n%\nOperating, administrative and other\n862 \n83.0 \n%\n784 \n82.4 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n13 \n1.3 \n%\n15 \n1.6 \n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n1,099 \n105.9 \n%\n985 \n103.5 \n%\nGain on disposition of real estate\n142 \n13.7 \n%\n27 \n2.9 \n%\nOperating income (loss)\n81 \n7.8 \n%\n(6)\n(0.6)\n%\nEquity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries\n117 \n11.3 \n%\n216 \n22.6 \n%\nOther income\n6 \n0.6 \n%\n— \n0.0 \n%\nAdd-back: Depreciation and amortization\n13 \n1.3 \n%\n15 \n1.6 \n%\nAdjustments:\nCarried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue\n8 \n0.8 \n%\n(7)\n(0.8)\n%\nCosts associated with efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives\n3 \n0.3 \n%\n21 \n2.3 \n%\nProvision associated with Telford’s fire safety remediation efforts\n33 \n3.2 \n%\n— \n0.0 \n%\nSegment operating profit and segment operating profit on revenue margin\n$\n261 \n25.1 \n%\n$\n239 \n25.1 \n%\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nRevenue increased 9.0% in 2024 as compared to 2023. This reflected an increase in incentive fees in our investment management business and higher construction management fees in our development services business. Foreign currency translation had a 0.9% positive impact on total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by strength in British pound sterling.\nCost of revenue increased 20.4% in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 due to higher construction and consulting costs incurred on our real estate development projects. Foreign currency translation had a 3.2% negative impact on total cost of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased 9.9%, primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation in our development services and investment management line of business consistent with higher revenue growth, partially offset by lower bonus expense to align with overall segment performance, and a decrease in charges associated with the company’s efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% negative impact on total operating expenses in 2024.\nGain on disposition of real estate increased by $115 million compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to gains recognized upon monetization of real estate development projects.\nWe recorded equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of approximately $117 million in 2024 as compared to equity income of $216 million in the same period in 2023, which included an unusually large gain on a development portfolio asset sale.\n35\nTable of Contents\nA roll forward of our assets under management (AUM) by product type for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows (dollars in billions):\nFunds\nSeparate Accounts\nSecurities\nTotal\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n65.3 \n$\n72.8 \n$\n9.4 \n$\n147.5 \nInflows\n3.7 \n9.0 \n0.8 \n13.5 \nOutflows\n(3.3)\n(5.9)\n(1.5)\n(10.7)\nMarket (depreciation) appreciation\n(1.7)\n(2.5)\n0.1 \n(4.1)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n64.0 \n$\n73.4 \n$\n8.8 \n$\n146.2 \nAUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures. Our AUM is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not to be the basis for determining our management fees. Our assets under management consist of:\n•\nthe total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM. The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. In the case of real estate operating companies, the total value of real properties controlled by the companies, generally through joint ventures, is included in AUM; and\n•\nthe net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds investments.\nOur calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCorporate and Other\nOur Corporate segment primarily consists of corporate overhead costs. Other consists of activities from strategic non-core, non-controlling equity investments and is considered an operating segment but does not meet the aggregation criteria for presentation as a separate reportable segment and is, therefore, combined with our core Corporate function and reported as Corporate and other. The following table summarizes our results of operations for our Corporate and other segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, \n(1)\n2024\n2023\nElimination of inter-segment revenue\n$\n(17)\n$\n(17)\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue\n (2)\n26 \n(3)\nOperating, administrative and other\n723 \n460 \nDepreciation and amortization\n57 \n56 \nTotal costs and expenses\n806 \n513 \nOperating loss\n(823)\n(530)\nEquity (loss) income from unconsolidated subsidiaries\n(134)\n27 \nOther income\n25 \n13 \nAdd-back: Depreciation and amortization\n57 \n56 \nAdjustments:\nIntegration and other costs related to acquisitions\n76 \n39 \nCosts incurred related to legal entity restructuring\n2 \n13 \nCosts associated with efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives\n151 \n14 \nCharges related to indirect tax audits and settlements\n76 \n— \nSegment operating loss\n$\n(570)\n$\n(368)\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nPercentage of revenue calculations are not meaningful and therefore not included.\n(2)\nPrimarily relates to inter-segment eliminations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nCore corporate\nOperating, administrative and other expenses for our core corporate function rose 57.5%, to $723 million in 2024, mainly due to an increase in our provision related to indirect taxes, increased charges associated with employee separation and integration and other costs related to acquisitions. In addition, we recorded higher incentive compensation expense reflecting improved business performance.\n Other (non-core)\nWe recorded equity loss of approximately $134 million in 2024 versus an equity income of $27 million in 2023. This reflects lower value of our investments, primarily driven by our investments in Altus and Industrious, partially offset by equity income from investments in other unconsolidated subsidiaries.\n37\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program. Our expected capital requirements for 2025 include up to $360 million of anticipated capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $279 million of capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions received. As of December 31, 2024, we had aggregate future commitments of $205 million related to co-investments funds in our REI segment, $74 million of which is expected to be funded in 2025. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, we are committed to fund additional capital of $330 million and $67 million to consolidated and unconsolidated projects, respectively, within our REI segment. As of December 31, 2024, we had $3.3 billion of borrowings available under our revolving credit facilities (under both the Revolving Credit Agreement, as described below, and the Turner & Townsend revolving credit facility) and $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We intend to maintain available commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement in an amount at least equal to the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding from time to time. As of December 31, 2024, we had $175 million in outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.\nWe have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facilities to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and general investment requirements (including in-fill acquisitions) and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements. In the absence of extraordinary events, large strategic acquisitions or large returns of capital to shareholders, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facilities would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. Given compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals are generally paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production, the negative effect of difficult market conditions is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. We may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive. We may also, from time to time in our sole discretion, purchase, redeem, or retire our existing senior notes, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, or otherwise. \nAs noted above, we believe that any future significant acquisitions we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing. In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable. However, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future.\nOur long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of three elements. The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness. If our cash flow is insufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates. We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.\nThe second long-term liquidity element is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions. Our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase consideration in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had accrued deferred purchase consideration totaling $292 million ($199 million of which was a current liability) and $530 million ($264 million of which was a current liability), respectively, which was included in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” and in “Other long-term liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nLastly, as described in Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report, in November 2024, our Board of Directors (Board) authorized an additional $5.0 billion to our existing $4.0 billion share repurchase program (as amended, the 2024 program) bringing the total authorized amount under the 2024 program to a total of $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2024. The Board also extended the term of the 2024 program through December 31, 2029. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 5,110,624 shares of our Class A common stock with an average price of $126.02 per share using cash on hand for an aggregate of $644 million. During the period January 1, 2025 through February 11, 2025, we repurchased 2,060,012 shares of our Class A common stock with an average price of $132.38 per share using cash on hand for an aggregate of $273 million. As of December 31, 2024 and February 11, 2025, we had $5.8 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, of capacity remaining under the 2024 program.\n38\nTable of Contents\nOur stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future repurchases with existing cash. We may utilize our stock repurchase programs to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program and on a more opportunistic basis if we believe our stock presents a compelling investment compared to other discretionary uses. The timing of any future repurchases, and the actual amounts repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors.\nAs more fully described in Note 22 – Telford Fire Safety Remediation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report, on March 16, 2023, Telford Homes entered into a legally binding agreement with the U.K. government, under which Telford Homes will (1) take responsibility for performing or funding remediation works relating to certain life-critical fire-safety issues on all Telford Homes-constructed buildings of 11 meters in height or greater in England constructed in the last 30 years (in-scope buildings) and (2) withdraw Telford Homes-developed buildings from the government-sponsored Building Safety Fund (BSF) and Aluminum Composite Material (ACM) Funds or reimburse the government funds for the cost of remediation of in-scope buildings.\nWe had an estimated liability of approximately $204 million (of which $102 million was current) and $192 million (of which $82 million was current) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the remediation efforts. We recognized additional provision in the year ended December 31, 2024 based on additional information obtained and evaluations performed allowing for a more refined estimate on a building-by-building basis.\nThe estimated remediation costs for in-scope buildings are subjective, highly complex and dependent on a number of variables outside of Telford Homes’ control. These include, but are not limited to, individual remediation requirements for each building, the time required for the remediation to be completed, cost of construction or remediation materials, availability of construction materials, potential discoveries made during remediation that could necessitate incremental work, investigation costs, availability of qualified fire safety engineers, potential business disruption costs, potential changes to or new regulations and regulatory approval. We will continue to assess new information as it becomes available during the remediation process and adjust our estimated liability accordingly.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,708 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $480 million in the prior year. The primary drivers that contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities were as follows: (1) higher net cash flows from operations, driven by revenue growth and (2) working capital improvements, driven by timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued expenses and lower accounts receivable.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $1,514 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $833 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of J&J Worldwide Services in February 2024 and Direct Line Global in June 2024.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increased outflow was primarily driven by higher payments of deferred purchase consideration, share repurchase, and taxes on equity awards; partially offset by proceeds from our commercial paper program, net proceeds from the revolver, and lower inflows from fixed term debt financing compared to prior year.\n39\nTable of Contents\nSummary of Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2024 (dollars in millions):\nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\nLess than 1 year\nTotal gross long-term debt \n(1)\n$\n3,320 \n$\n36 \nShort-term borrowings \n(2)\n906 \n906 \nOperating leases \n(3)\n2,576 \n199 \nFinancing leases \n(3)\n432 \n43 \nTotal gross notes payable on real estate \n(4)\n200 \n100 \nDeferred purchase consideration \n(5)\n276 \n207 \nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n7,710 \n$\n1,491 \nAmount of Other Commitments\nOther Commitments\nTotal\nLess than 1 year\nSelf-insurance reserves \n(6)\n$\n197 \n$\n197 \nTax liabilities \n(7)\n30 \n30 \nCo-investments \n(8) (9)\n272 \n142 \nLetters of credit \n(8)\n272 \n272 \nGuarantees \n(8) (10)\n211 \n211 \nTelford’s fire safety remediation provision \n(11)\n204 \n102 \nTotal other commitments\n$\n1,186 \n$\n954 \nThe table above excludes estimated payment obligations for our qualified defined benefit pension plans.

See Note 11 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Figures do not include scheduled interest payments. Assuming each debt obligation is held until maturity, we estimate that we will make $918 million of interest payments, $164 million of which will be made in 2025.\n(2)\nThe majority of this balance represents our warehouse lines of credit, which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets, Inc. (CBRE Capital Markets) and are secured by our related warehouse receivables. See Note 5 – Warehouse Receivables & Warehouse Lines of Credit and Note 11 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n(3)\nIncludes forecasted interest expense. See Note 12 – Leases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n(4)\nReflects gross outstanding notes payable on real estate as of December 31, 2024 ($9 million of which is recourse to us, beyond being recourse to the single-purpose entity that held the real estate asset and was the primary obligor on the note payable), assumed to be paid at maturity, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs. Amounts do not include scheduled interest payments. The notes have either fixed or variable interest rates, ranging from 3.0% to 8.1% at December 31, 2024.\n(5)\nRepresents deferred obligations, excluding contingent considerations, related to previous acquisitions, which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n(6)\nRepresents outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs, which are included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report. While $4 million of the $197 million in claim payments are expected to be payable within one year, due to the nature of this item, claim payments representing the remaining balance of $193 million could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain events. Accordingly, the entire balance has been reflected as expiring in less than one year.\n(7)\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have a remaining federal tax liability of $30 million associated with the Transition Tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. We are paying the federal tax liability for the Transition Tax in annual interest-free installments over a period of eight years through 2025 as allowed by the Tax Act. The next installment is due in 2025 for the 2024 fiscal year.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $347 million. Of this amount, we expect an insignificant amount of cash settlement in less than one year. See Note 15 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n(8)\nSee Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n(9)\nIncludes $205 million to fund future co-investments in our REI segment, $74 million of which is expected to be funded in 2025, and $67 million committed to invest in unconsolidated real estate projects. This amount does not include capital committed to consolidated projects of $330 million as of December 31, 2024.\n(10)\nDue to the nature of guarantees, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including default. Accordingly, all guarantees are reflected as expiring in less than one year.\n(11)\nSee Note 22 – Telford Fire Safety Remediation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n40\nTable of Contents\nIndebtedness\nWe use a variety of financing arrangements, both long-term and short-term, to fund our operations in addition to cash generated from operating activities. We also use several funding sources to avoid becoming overly dependent on one financing source, and to lower funding costs.\nLong-Term Debt\nOn July 10, 2023, CBRE Group, Inc., CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE Services) and Relam Amsterdam Holdings B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Services, entered into a new 5-year senior unsecured Credit Agreement (2023 Credit Agreement) maturing on July 10, 2028, which refinanced and replaced the previous credit agreement. The 2023 Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured term loan credit facility comprised of (i) tranche A Euro-denominated term loans in an aggregate principal amount of €367 million and (ii) tranche A U.S. Dollar-denominated term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million with weighted average interest rate of 4.9% as of December 31, 2024, both requiring quarterly principal payments beginning on December 31, 2024 and continuing through maturity on July 10, 2028. The proceeds of the term loans under the 2023 Credit Agreement were applied to the repayment of all remaining outstanding senior term loans, approximately $437 million, under the previous credit agreement, the payment of related fees and expenses and other general corporate purposes.\nThe term loan borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by CBRE Group, Inc. and CBRE Services.\nOn February 23, 2024, CBRE Services issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior notes due April 1, 2029 (the 5.500% senior notes) at a price equal to 99.837% of their face value.

The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility available to CBRE Services with commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3.5 billion and a maturity date of August 5, 2027.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to pay a fee based on the total amount of the revolving credit facility commitment (whether used or unused). In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement also includes capacity for letters of credit not to exceed $300 million in the aggregate. The Revolving Credit Agreement is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CBRE Group, Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $132 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility provided for by the Revolving Credit Agreement. No letters of credit were outstanding as of December 31, 2024. As of February 11, 2025 and December 31, 2023, no amounts were outstanding under this revolving credit facility. Letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business and would reduce the amount we may borrow under this revolving credit facility.\nOn December 2, 2024, CBRE Services established a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue and sell up to $3.5 billion of short-term, unsecured and unsubordinated commercial paper notes with up to 397-day maturities, under the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. Payment of the commercial paper notes is guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by CBRE Group, Inc. The program notes and the guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The proceeds from issuances under the program may be used for general corporate purposes. The company intends to maintain available commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement in an amount at least equal to the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding from time to time. As of December 31, 2024, we had $175 million in outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program with a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.77%. As of February 11, 2025, we had $1.3 billion in outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.\n42\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, Turner & Townsend maintains a £120 million revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement dated March 31, 2022, with an additional accordion option of £20 million, that matures on March 31, 2027. As of December 31, 2024, $44 million (£35 million) was outstanding under this revolving credit facility and bears interest at the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) plus 0.78%. As of December 31, 2023, $10 million (£8 million) was outstanding under this revolving credit facility. As of February 11, 2025, no amount was outstanding under this revolving credit facility. \nWe also maintain warehouse lines of credit with certain third-party lenders. For additional information on all of our short-term borrowings, see Note 5 – Warehouse Receivables & Warehouse Lines of Credit and Note 11 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nTo recognize revenue in a transaction with a customer, we evaluate the five steps of the \nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) \nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, \n“\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n” \nrevenue recognition framework: (1) identify the contract; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied.\nOur revenue recognition policies are consistent with this five-step framework. Understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time, amount, and method to recognize revenue for each transaction requires significant judgement. These significant judgements include: (i) determining what point in time or what measure of progress depicts the transfer of control to the customer; (ii) applying the series guidance to certain performance obligations satisfied over time; (iii) estimating how and when contingencies, or other forms of variable consideration, will impact the timing and amount of recognition of revenue and (iv) determining whether we control third party services before they are transferred to the customer in order to appropriately recognize the associated revenue on either a gross or net basis. The timing and amount of revenue recognition in a period could vary if different judgments were made. Our revenues subject to the most judgment are sales and lease commission revenue, incentive-based management fees, development fees and third party fees associated with our occupier outsourcing and property management services. For a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies, see the Revenue Recognition section within \nNote 2 – Significant Accounting Policies\n of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheets included goodwill of $5.6 billion and other intangible assets of $2.3 billion.\nOur acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value. We engage a third-party valuation firm to assist us in identifying and determining the fair values of intangible assets acquired. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist. Assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives. These assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded. Different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities. Since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews.\nWe test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the potential for impairment is more likely than not. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment with respect to any of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible \n43\nTable of Contents\nassets to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is needed. We are permitted to assess based on qualitative factors whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative impairment test. Our procedures under qualitative tests include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors and entity specific events. If we determine that a reporting unit’s goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset may be impaired after utilizing these qualitative impairment analysis procedures, we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test. When performing a quantitative test, we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Management’s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of these fair values and the relative size of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.\nWe did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2024 annual impairment tests, as it was determined that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets were substantially in excess of their carrying values as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets are at risk of decreasing below their carrying values in the next twelve months. For additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing, see Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, “\nAccounting for Income Taxes\n” (Topic 740). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nAccounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties. We also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. We do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods. While we believe the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with Topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.\nOur future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.\nSee Note 15 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding income taxes.\n44\nTable of Contents\nTelford Fire Safety Remediation\nAs of December 31, 2024, the company had an estimated liability of $204 million on the balance sheet which represents management’s best estimate of future losses associated with overall remediation efforts. It includes amounts that the U.K. government has already paid or quantified through the Building Safety Fund and estimates developed by Telford’s internal team and/or third-party experts for the remaining in-scope buildings. The estimates were developed using the best available data, including (i) industry data, (ii) fire safety assessments (also known as Publicly Available Specification (PAS) assessments and include fire risk appraisal of external wall construction) which identified remediation work to be performed on specific buildings, and (iii) bids from subcontractors. We applied an inflation factor to account for uncertainty in completion of remediation activities, which could take an extended period of time to complete, an estimate of direct costs associated with an internal team dedicated to this remediation, and a contingency to account for unknown remediation costs. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to its subjective, highly complex nature and other unknowns such as individual remediation requirements, time required for remediation, and cost of materials and resources amongst others. We will continue to assess new information as it becomes available during the remediation process and adjust our estimated liability accordingly.\nSee Note 22 – Telford Fire Safety Remediation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information.\n45\nTable of Contents\nInvestments in unconsolidated subsidiaries – fair value option\nWe have elected the fair value option for certain of our investments in non-public entities to align with our strategy for these investments. Such investments without readily determinable fair values are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. We estimate the fair market value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs which requires judgment due to the absence of market prices or similar assets in active markets. In determining the estimated fair value of these investments, we utilize appropriate valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses and Monte Carlo simulations. Key inputs to the discounted cash flow analyses include projected cash flows, terminal growth rate, and discount rate. Key inputs to Monte Carlo simulations include stock price, volatility, risk free rate, and dividend yield.\nChanges in the fair value of equity investments under the fair value option are recorded as equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee New Accounting Pronouncements discussion within Note 3 – New Accounting Pronouncements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n46\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet revenue, segment operating profit on revenue margin, segment operating profit on net revenue margin, core EBITDA, core adjusted net income and core earnings per diluted share (or core EPS) are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We generally use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. We believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected costs and charges that may obscure the underlying performance of our business and related trends. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of net revenue, core EBITDA, core adjusted net income and core EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nNet revenue is gross revenue less costs largely associated with subcontracted vendor work performed for clients and is passed through to the client generally with no margin. Segment operating profit on revenue margin is computed by dividing segment operating profit by revenue and provides a comparable profitability measure against our peers. Segment operating profit on net revenue margin is computed by dividing segment operating profit by net revenue and is a better indicator of the segment’s margin since it does not include the diluting effect of pass-through revenue which generally has no margin.\nWe use core EBITDA, core adjusted net income and core earnings per share (or core EPS) as indicators of the company’s operating financial performance. Core EBITDA and core adjusted net income represent earnings before the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, asset impairments, adjustments related to carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue, costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring, efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives, integration and other costs related to acquisitions, provision associated with Telford’s fire safety remediation efforts, charges related to indirect tax audits and settlements, a one-time gain associated with remeasuring an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary to fair value as of the date the remaining controlling interest was acquired, fair value changes on certain non-core non-controlling equity investments, the impact of fair value adjustments related to unconsolidated equity investments, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets attributable to acquisitions and restructuring activities and related impact on income taxes and non-controlling interest. We believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending. \nCore EBITDA, core adjusted net income and core EPS are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. These measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt. We also use core EBITDA and core EPS as significant components when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCore EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc.\n$\n968 \n$\n986 \nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n68 \n41 \nNet income\n1,036 \n1,027 \nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization\n674 \n622 \nInterest expense, net of interest income\n215 \n149 \nProvision for income taxes\n182 \n250 \nCarried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue\n8 \n(7)\nIntegration and other costs related to acquisitions\n93 \n62 \nCosts incurred related to legal entity restructuring\n2 \n13 \nCosts associated with efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives\n259 \n159 \nProvision associated with Telford’s fire safety remediation efforts\n33 \n— \nImpact of fair value non-cash adjustments related to unconsolidated equity investments\n9 \n— \nCharges related to indirect tax audits and settlements\n76 \n— \nOne-time gain associated with remeasuring an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary to fair value as of the date the remaining controlling interest was acquired\n— \n(34)\nNet fair value adjustments on strategic non-core investments\n117 \n(32)\nCore EBITDA\n$\n2,704 \n$\n2,209 \nCore net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders, as adjusted (or core adjusted net income), and core EPS, are calculated as follows (in millions, except share and per share data):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc.\n$\n968 \n$\n986 \nAdjustments:\nIntegration and other costs related to acquisitions\n93 \n62 \nCosts incurred related to legal entity restructuring\n2 \n13 \nCosts associated with efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives\n259 \n159 \nImpact of fair value non-cash adjustments related to unconsolidated equity investments\n9 \n— \nProvision associated with Telford’s fire safety remediation efforts\n33 \n— \nCarried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue\n8 \n(7)\nCharges related to indirect tax audits and settlements\n76 \n— \nOne-time gain associated with remeasuring an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary to fair value as of the date the remaining controlling interest was acquired\n— \n(34)\nNet fair value adjustments on strategic non-core investments\n117 \n(32)\nNon-cash depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets attributable to acquisitions\n199 \n167 \nInterest expense related to indirect tax audits and settlements\n16 \n— \nTax impact of adjusted items, tax benefit attributable to legal entity restructuring, and strategic non-core investments\n(191)\n(82)\nImpact of adjustments on non-controlling interest\n(18)\n(33)\nCore net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., as adjusted\n$\n1,571 \n$\n1,199 \nCore diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., as adjusted\n$\n5.10 \n$\n3.84 \nWeighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per share\n308,033,612\n312,550,942\n48\nTable of Contents\nNet revenue and gross revenue from resilient business lines is calculated as follows (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet revenue from resilient business lines\nFacilities management\n$\n6,907 \n$\n5,806 \nProperty management\n2,123 \n1,840 \nProject management\n3,433 \n3,124 \nValuation\n751 \n716 \nLoan servicing\n331 \n317 \nRecurring investment management fees \n(1)\n537 \n539 \nTotal net revenue from resilient business lines\n14,082 \n12,342 \nPass-through costs also recognized as revenue\n14,899 \n13,673 \nTotal revenue from resilient business lines\n$\n28,981 \n$\n26,015 \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nRecurring investment management fees is included in Investment management revenue.\n49\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nOur exposure to market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations. We manage such risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2024, we had seven outstanding cross-currency swaps to effectively hedge foreign currency exposure related to certain foreign subsidiaries and a U.S. dollar denominated term loan entered into by a euro functional entity. See Note 7 – Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on fair value methodology used to value the swaps at December 31, 2024. We apply FASB ASC Topic 815, “\nDerivatives and Hedging,\n” when accounting for derivative financial instruments. In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. \nInternational Operations\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside the U.S. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally. Our Real Estate Investments (REI) business segment has significant euro and British pound denominated assets under management (AUM), as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe. In addition, our Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) business segment derives significant revenue and earnings in foreign currencies, such as the euro and British pound sterling. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may continue to produce corresponding changes in our AUM, revenue and earnings.\nOur foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional (reporting) currency, which is the U.S. dollar. During 2024, we entered into four cross-currency swaps with a total USD notional value of $875 million to effectively hedge the foreign currency exposure related to certain Euro denominated entities and two cross-currency swaps with a total USD notional value of $165 million to effectively hedge the foreign currency exposure related to certain Japanese Yen denominated entities.\nOur businesses could suffer from adverse effects of high interest rates, a rapid increase in interest rates, limited access to debt capital or liquidity constraints, downturns in general macroeconomic conditions, regulatory or financial market uncertainty, or unforeseen disruptions such as geopolitical events and public health crisis (or the perception that such disruptions may occur).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, 43.6% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies. The following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies (dollars in millions): \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nUnited States dollar\n$\n20,166 \n56.4 \n%\n$\n17,470 \n54.7 \n%\nBritish pound sterling\n4,968 \n13.9 \n%\n4,393 \n13.8 \n%\nEuro\n3,239 \n9.1 \n%\n3,003 \n9.4 \n%\nCanadian dollar\n1,083 \n3.0 \n%\n1,195 \n3.7 \n%\nAustralian dollar\n941 \n2.6 \n%\n867 \n2.7 \n%\nIndian rupee\n756 \n2.1 \n%\n663 \n2.1 \n%\nJapanese yen\n528 \n1.5 \n%\n485 \n1.5 \n%\nSwiss franc\n491 \n1.4 \n%\n427 \n1.3 \n%\nChinese yuan\n490 \n1.4 \n%\n516 \n1.6 \n%\nSingapore dollar\n430 \n1.2 \n%\n413 \n1.3 \n%\nOther currencies \n(1)\n2,675 \n7.4 \n%\n2,517 \n7.9 \n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n35,767 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n31,949 \n100.0 \n%\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nApproximately 46 currencies comprise 7.4% and 7.9% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n50\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we operate globally, we report our results in U.S. dollars. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results. A hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound sterling during the year ended December 31, 2024, would have decreased pre-tax income by $10 million. A hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro would have decreased pre-tax income by $9 million. These hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into U.S. dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10% change in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in revenue and earnings as well as the assets under management for our investment management business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing tax, trade and regulatory environments, which affect the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. We routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.\nInterest Rates\nWe manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates.\nThe estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately $708 million at December 31, 2024. Based on dealers’ quotes, the estimated fair values of our 5.950% senior notes, 5.500% senior notes, 4.875% senior notes and 2.500% senior notes were $1.0 billion, $509 million, $600 million and $426 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024.\nWe utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on our variable rate debt. If interest rates were to increase 100 basis points on our outstanding variable rate debt as of December 31, 2024, the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of $11 million on pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n51\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements\n(KPMG LLP, Los Angeles, CA, Auditor Firm ID: \n185\n)\n53\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n55\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n57\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n and \n2022\n58\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n and \n2022\n59\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n and \n2022\n60\nConsolidated Statements of Equity for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n61\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n62\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES:\nSchedule II -Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\n119\nAll other schedules are omitted because they are either not applicable, not required or the information required is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto.\n52\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nCBRE Group, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n53\nTable of Contents\nAssessment of gross unrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $347 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company utilizes a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe identified the assessment of the gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment and the involvement of tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were required in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the resolution of the tax positions underlying the unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits process, including the interpretation of tax law and the estimate of the unrecognized tax benefits. Since tax law is complex and often subject to interpretations, we involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n•\nObtaining and understanding of the Company’s tax planning strategies including change sin legal entity structures and intercompany financing arrangements,\n•\nEvaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax law and the potential impact on the Company’s tax positions,\n•\nInspecting correspondence with applicable taxing authorities, and assessing the expiration of statutes of limitations, and,\n•\nPerforming an independent assessment of certain of the Company’s tax positions and comparing the results to the Company’s assessment.\n/s/ \nKPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 14, 2025\n54\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nCBRE Group, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited CBRE Group, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company acquired J&J Worldwide Services during 2024, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, J&J Worldwide Services’ internal control over financial reporting associated with four percent of total assets and one percent of total revenue included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of J&J Worldwide Services.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n55\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 14, 2025\n56\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Dollars in millions, except share data)\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,114\n \n$\n1,265\n \nRestricted cash\n107\n \n106\n \nReceivables, less allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n101\n and $\n102\n at \n   December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n7,005\n \n6,370\n \nWarehouse receivables\n561\n \n675\n \nContract assets\n400\n \n443\n \nPrepaid expenses\n332\n \n333\n \nIncome taxes receivable\n130\n \n159\n \nOther current assets\n321\n \n315\n \nTotal Current Assets\n9,970\n \n9,666\n \nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization of $\n1,795\n and $\n1,576\n at\n   December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n914\n \n907\n \nGoodwill\n5,621\n \n5,129\n \nOther intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $\n2,494\n and $\n2,179\n at \n   December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n2,298\n \n2,081\n \nOperating lease assets\n1,198\n \n1,030\n \nInvestments in unconsolidated subsidiaries (with $\n890\n and $\n997\n at fair value at \n   December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively)\n1,295\n \n1,374\n \nNon-current contract assets\n89\n \n75\n \nReal estate under development\n505\n \n300\n \nNon-current income taxes receivable\n75\n \n78\n \nDeferred tax assets, net\n538\n \n361\n \nOther assets, net\n1,880\n \n1,547\n \nTotal Assets\n$\n24,383\n \n$\n22,548\n \nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\n4,102\n \n$\n3,562\n \nCompensation and employee benefits payable\n1,419\n \n1,459\n \nAccrued bonus and profit sharing\n1,695\n \n1,556\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n200\n \n242\n \nContract liabilities\n375\n \n298\n \nIncome taxes payable\n209\n \n217\n \nWarehouse lines of credit (which fund loans that U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises have committed to purchase)\n552\n \n666\n \nRevolving credit facility\n132\n \n—\n \nOther short-term borrowings\n222\n \n16\n \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n36\n \n9\n \nOther current liabilities\n345\n \n218\n \nTotal Current Liabilities\n9,287\n \n8,243\n \nLong-term debt, net of current maturities\n3,245\n \n2,804\n \nNon-current operating lease liabilities\n1,307\n \n1,089\n \nNon-current income taxes payable\n—\n \n30\n \nNon-current tax liabilities\n160\n \n157\n \nDeferred tax liabilities, net\n247\n \n255\n \nOther liabilities\n945\n \n903\n \nTotal Liabilities\n15,191\n \n13,481\n \nEquity:\nCBRE Group, Inc.

We are the world’s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2024 revenue, with leading global market positions in most lines of business we serve. \nOur business is focused on providing services to real estate investors and occupiers. For investors, we provide capital markets (property sales and mortgage origination), mortgage servicing, property leasing, investment management, property management, valuation and development services, among others. For occupiers, we provide facilities management, project management, transaction (both property sales and leasing) and consulting services, among others. We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and commissions generated by transactions. As of December 31, 2024, the company has more than \n140,000\n employees (including Turner & Townsend employees) serving clients in more than \n100\n countries providing services under the following brand names: “CBRE” (real estate advisory and outsourcing services); “CBRE Investment Management” (investment management); “Trammell Crow Company” (primarily U.S. development); and “Telford Living” (U.K. development); “Turner & Townsend Holdings Limited” (global program, project and cost management) and “J&J Worldwide Services” (outsourcing services for the U.S. federal government).\n2.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our consolidated subsidiaries, which are comprised of variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities, in which we determined we have a controlling financial interest, under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, “\nConsolidations.\n” The equity attributable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nWe determine whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective. Our determination of whether an entity in which we hold a direct or indirect variable interest is a VIE is based on several factors, including whether the entity’s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. We make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis, and then a quantitative analysis, if necessary.\nWe analyze any investments in VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary. In evaluating whether we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate our direct and indirect economic interests in the entity. A reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the VIE. Determining which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is primarily a qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity. Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment.\nWe consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance including, but not limited to, the ability to direct financing, leasing, construction and other operating decisions and activities. In addition, we consider the rights of other investors to participate in those decisions, to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time we become involved with a variable interest entity and reconsider that conclusion continually.\nWe consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary and disclose significant VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary, if any, as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to VIEs that are not consolidated (see Note 6 – Variable Interest Entities).\n62\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nVoting Interest Entities (VOEs)\nFor VOEs, we consolidate the entity if we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest in a VOE if: (i) for legal entities other than limited partnerships, we own a majority voting interest in the VOE or, for limited partnerships and similar entities, we own a majority of the entity’s kick-out rights through voting limited partnership interests; and (ii) non-controlling shareholders or partners do not hold substantive participating rights and no other conditions exist that would indicate that we do not control the entity.\nDebt and Equity Securities and Other Investments\nDebt securities are classified as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Debt securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale. Available for sale debt securities are carried at their fair value and any difference between cost and fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss, net of income taxes, and is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of equity. Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest using the effective interest method. Realized gains and losses and declines in value resulting from credit losses on available for sale debt securities have not been significant. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income.\nOur investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but do not control, or entities which are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 323, “\nInstruments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures.”\n We eliminate transactions with such equity method subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership in such subsidiaries. Accordingly, our share of the earnings from these equity-method basis companies, generally recognized on a lag of three months or less, is included in consolidated net income. We have elected to account for certain eligible investments and related interests at fair value in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 825, \n“Financial Instruments.”\nFor a portion of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries reported at fair value, we estimate fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) our investees provide. These investments are considered investment companies, or are the equivalent of investment companies, as they carry all investments at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected in earnings. Accordingly, we effectively carry our investments at an amount that is equivalent to our proportionate share of the net assets of each investment that would be allocated to us if each investment was liquidated at the net asset value as of the measurement date. \nEquity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method (primarily marketable equity securities) are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. Equity instruments that do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for using the net asset value per share practical expedient in FASB ASC Topic 820, \n“Fair Value Measurements”\n (Topic 820) are measured at cost, less any impairment, and adjusted for subsequent observable transactions for the same or similar investments of the same issuer.\nImpairment Evaluation\nImpairment losses on investments, other than available for sale debt securities and investments otherwise measured at fair value, are recognized upon evidence of other-than-temporary losses of value. When testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market, we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments and/or look to comparable activities in the marketplace. Management’s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach. These assumptions include net asset values, internal rates of return, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and financing terms, rental rates, timing of leasing activity, estimates of lease terms and related concessions, etc. When determining if impairment is other-than-temporary, we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and near-term prospects of each investment. Based on our review, we did not record any significant other-than-temporary impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n63\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include the value of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, real estate assets, accounts receivable, contract assets, operating lease assets, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement, other post-employment benefits, and loss contingencies, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on our best judgment. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including consideration of the current economic environment, and adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. We also manage certain cash and cash equivalents as an agent for our investment and property and facilities management clients. These amounts are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (see “Fiduciary Funds” discussion below).\nRestricted Cash\nIncluded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is restricted cash of $\n107\n million and $\n106\n million, respectively. The balances primarily include restricted cash set aside to cover funding obligations as required by contracts executed by us in the ordinary course of business.\nFiduciary Funds\nThe accompanying consolidated balance sheets do not include the net assets of escrow, agency and fiduciary funds, which are held by us on behalf of clients.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and interest-bearing investments. Users of real estate services account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required. The risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the large number of users and their geographic dispersion.\nWe place substantially all our interest-bearing investments with several major financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, which includes leasehold improvements, is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging up to \n10\n years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of their associated leases, excluding options to renew unless we are reasonably certain that we will exercise the option to renew, or the estimated useful life of the asset. We capitalize expenditures that significantly increase the life of our assets and expense the costs of maintenance and repairs.\nWe review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If this review indicates that such assets are considered impaired, the impairment is recognized in the period the changes occur and represents the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group.\n64\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nCertain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized. Internal-use software costs incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Significant direct consulting costs and certain payroll and related costs, which are incurred during the development stage of a project are generally capitalized and amortized over a \nthree-year\n period (except for enterprise software development platforms, which range from \nthree\n to \nseven years\n) when placed into production.\nReal Estate\nClassification and Impairment Evaluation\nWe classify real estate in accordance with the criteria of the FASB ASC Topic 360, “\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n” (Topic 360) as follows: (i) real estate held for sale, which includes completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of Topic 360’s “held for sale” criteria; (ii) real estate under development (current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (iii) real estate under development (non-current), which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date; or (iv) real estate held for investment, which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the “held for sale” criteria. Any asset reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate held for investment is recorded individually at the lower of its fair value at the date of the reclassification or its carrying amount before it was classified as “held for sale,” adjusted (in the case of real estate held for investment) for any depreciation that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as real estate held for investment.\nReal estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. If an asset’s fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash flows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset. Real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation and impairment, as applicable. Buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally up to \n39\n years. Tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or terms of the respective leases. Land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, up to \n15\n years.\nReal estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset’s carrying amount. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value, which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.\nA summary of our real estate assets is as follows (dollars in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nReal estate under development, current (included in other current assets)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nReal estate and other assets held for sale (included in other current assets)\n40\n \n42\n \nReal estate under development\n505\n \n300\n \nReal estate held for investment (included in other assets, net)\n243\n \n179\n \nTotal real estate\n$\n788\n \n$\n521\n \nCost Capitalization and Allocation\nWhen acquiring, developing, and constructing real estate assets, we capitalize recoverable costs. Capitalization begins when the activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy. Recoverable costs capitalized include pursuit costs, or pre-acquisition/pre-construction costs, taxes and insurance, interest, development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations. We do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring, developing, and constructing real estate assets. We expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, “\nBusiness Combinations\n” (Topic 805). Pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined not to pursue are written off in the period that determination is made.\n65\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAt times, we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases. The land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction except for newly acquired held for sale phases which are measured at their fair value less cost to sell at the acquisition date. We allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases; if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase, we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values, where practicable, or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances. Relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised.\nWhen acquiring real estate with existing buildings, we allocate the purchase price between land, land improvements, building and intangibles related to in-place leases, if any, based on their relative fair values. The fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with lease-up assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition. The fair value of in-place leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or below-market rents and tenant origination costs, determined on a lease-by-lease basis. The capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases. Amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense.\nDisposition of Real Estate\nWe account for gains and losses on the sale of real estate and other nonfinancial assets or in substance n\nonfinancial assets to noncu\nstomers that are not an output of our ordinary activities and are not a business in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 610-20, \n“Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets.” \nWhere we do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity that holds the transferred assets after the transaction, we derecognize the assets or in substance nonfinancial assets and recognize a gain or loss when control of the underlying assets transfers to the counterparty.\nWe may also dispose of real estate through the transfer of a long-term leasehold representing a major part of the remaining economic life of the property. We account for these transfers as sales-type leases in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 842, “\nLease\ns” by derecognizing the carrying amount of the underlying asset, recognizing any net investment in the lease and recognizing selling profit or loss in net income.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nOur acquisitions of businesses require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Deferred consideration arrangements granted in connection with a business combination are evaluated to determine whether all or a portion is, in substance, additional purchase price or compensation for services. Additional purchase price is added to the fair value of consideration transferred in the business combination and compensation is included in operating expenses in the period it is incurred. \nWe are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually, or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, “\nIntangibles – Goodwill and Other.\n” The guidance permits, but does not require an entity to perform a qualitative assessment with respect to any of its reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is needed. Entities are permitted to assess based on qualitative factors whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s or indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative impairment test. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the entity conducts the quantitative impairment test. If not, the entity does not need to apply the quantitative test. The qualitative test is elective, and an entity can go directly to the quantitative test rather than making a more-likely-than-not assessment based on an evaluation of qualitative factors. When performing a quantitative test, we primarily use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Management’s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. These assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc. We record an impairment loss when the amount by which a reporting unit’s or indefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset. \nSee Note 9 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for more information.\n \n66\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nBusiness Combinations\nWe estimate the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and any non-controlling interests acquired in a business combination and recognize goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the recorded value of the acquired assets and liabilities in accordance with Topic 805. When estimating the fair value of acquired assets, we utilize various valuation models which may require significant judgment, particularly where observable market values do not exist. Inputs requiring significant judgment may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates, market values, depreciated replacement costs, selling prices less costs to dispose, and remaining useful lives, among others. Reasonable differences in these inputs could have a significant impact on the estimated value of acquired assets, the resulting value of goodwill, subsequent depreciation and amortization expense, and the results of future asset impairment evaluations.\nLeases\nWe are the lessee in contracts for our office space tenancies, for leased vehicles, and for some leases of land in our global development business. We monitor our service arrangements to evaluate whether they meet the definition of a lease.\nThe present value of lease payments, which are either fixed payments, in-substance fixed payments, or variable payments tied to an index or rate are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets with corresponding lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets upon the commencement of the lease. These lease costs are expensed over the respective lease term in accordance with the classification of the lease (i.e., operating versus finance classification). Variable lease payments not tied to an index or rate are expensed as incurred and are not subject to capitalization. After the commencement date, any modifications to the leasing arrangement are assessed and the ROU asset and lease liability are remeasured to recognize modifications to the lease term, leased asset, or lease payments.\nThe base terms for our lease arrangements typically do not extend beyond \n10\n years, except for land leases. We commonly have renewal options in our leases, but most of these options do not create a significant economic incentive for us to extend the lease term. Therefore, payments during periods covered by these renewal options are typically not included in our lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. Specific to our vehicle leases, early termination options are common and economic penalties associated with early termination of these contracts are typically significant enough to make it reasonably certain that we will not exercise such options. Therefore, payments during periods covered by these early termination options in vehicle leases are typically included in our lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. As an accounting policy election, our short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized as lease liabilities and right-of-use assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The rent expense associated with short term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and was not significant.\nMost of our office space leases include variable payments based on our share of actual common area maintenance and operating costs of the leased property. Many of our vehicle leases include variable payments based on actual service and fuel costs. For both office space and vehicle leases, we have elected the practical expedient to not separate lease components from non-lease components. Therefore, these costs are classified as variable lease payments.\nLease payments are typically discounted at our incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined in the absence of key inputs which are typically not reported by our lessors. Because we do not generally borrow on a collateralized basis, judgement was used to estimate the secured borrowing rate associated with our leases based on relevant market data and our inputs applied to accepted valuation methodologies. The incremental borrowing rate calculated for each lease also reflects the lease term, currency, and geography specific to each lease.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nCosts incurred in connection with financing activities are generally deferred and amortized over the terms of the related debt agreements ranging up to \neleven years\n. Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. Amortization of these costs is charged to interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-15, \n“Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements”\n permits classifying debt issuance costs associated with a line of credit arrangement as an asset, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. Total deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to our revolving line of credit have been included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and were $\n6\n million and $\n9\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n67\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nSee Note 11 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings for additional information on activities associated with our debt.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue with customers in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606, “\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n”\n \n(Topic 606). Revenue is recognized when or as control of the promised services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nThe following is a description of principal activities – separated by reportable segments – from which we generate revenue. For more detailed information about our reportable segments, see Note 18 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers and Note 19 – Segments.\nAdvisory Services\nOur Advisory Services segment provides a comprehensive range of services globally, including property leasing, property sales, mortgage origination, mortgage servicing, property management and valuation services.\nProperty Leasing and Property Sales\nWe provide strategic advice and execution for owners, investors, and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing of office, industrial and retail space. We also offer clients fully integrated property sales services under the CBRE Capital Markets brand. We are compensated for our services in the form of a commission and, in some instances, may earn various forms of variable incentive consideration. Our commission is paid upon the occurrence of certain contractual event(s) which may be contingent. For example, a portion of our leasing commission may be paid upon signing of the lease by the tenant, with the remaining paid upon occurrence of another future contingent event (e.g., payment of first month’s rent or tenant move-in). For leases, we typically satisfy our performance obligation at a point in time when control is transferred; generally, at the time of the first contractual event where there is a present right to payment. We look to history, experience with a customer, and deal specific considerations as part of the most likely outcome estimation approach to support our judgement that the second contingency (if applicable) will be met. Therefore, we typically accelerate the recognition of the revenue associated with the second contingent event. For property sales, our commission is typically paid at the closing of the sale, which represents transfer of control for services to the customer.\nIn addition to our commission, we may recognize other forms of variable consideration which can include, but are not limited to, commissions subject to concession or claw back and volume-based discounts or rebates. We assess variable consideration on a contract-by-contract basis, and when appropriate, recognize revenue based on our assessment of the outcome (using the most likely outcome approach or weighted probability) and historical results, if comparable and representative. We recognize variable consideration if it is deemed probable that there will not be significant reversal in the future.\nMortgage Originations and Loan Sales\nWe offer clients commercial mortgage and structured financing services. Fees from services within our mortgage brokerage business that are in the scope of Topic 606 include fees earned for the brokering of commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms, national and regional banks, credit companies, insurance companies and pension funds. We are compensated for our brokerage services via a fee paid upon successful placement of a commercial mortgage borrower with a lender who will provide financing. The fee earned is contingent upon the funding of the loan, which represents the transfer of control for services to the customer. Therefore, we typically satisfy our performance obligation at the point in time of the funding of the loan. \nWe also earn fees from the origination and sale of commercial mortgage loans for which the company retains the servicing rights. Revenue from fees earned from Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) are out of the scope of Topic 606. These fees are governed by FASB ASC Topic 820, “\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n” (Topic 820) and FASB ASC Topic 860, “\nTransfers and Servicing.\n” Upon origination of a mortgage loan held for sale, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) to be retained is included in the forecasted proceeds from the anticipated loan sale and results in a net gain (which is reflected in revenue). Upon sale, we record a servicing asset or liability based on the fair value of the retained MSR associated with the transferred loan. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. They are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that the servicing income is expected to be received. \n68\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nProperty Management Services\nWe provide property management services on a contractual basis for owners of and investors in office, industrial and retail properties. These services include marketing, building engineering, accounting, and financial services. We are compensated for our services through a monthly management fee earned based on either a specified percentage of the monthly rental income, rental receipts generated from the property under management or a fixed fee. We are also often reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs directly attributable to the properties under management. Property management services represent a series of distinct daily services rendered over time. Consistent with the transfer of control for distinct, daily services to the customer, revenue is recognized at the end of each period for the fees associated with the services performed. The amount of revenue recognized is presented gross for any services provided by our employees, as we control them. We generally do not control third-party services delivered to property management clients. As such, we generally report revenues net of third-party reimbursements.\nValuation Services\nWe provide valuation services that include market-value appraisals, litigation support, discounted cash flow analyses, feasibility studies as well as consulting services such as property condition reports, hotel advisory and environmental consulting. We are compensated for valuation services in the form of a fee, which is payable on the occurrence of certain events (e.g., a portion on the delivery of a draft report with the remaining on the delivery of the final report). For consulting services, we may be paid based on the occurrence of time or event-based milestones (such as the delivery of draft reports). We typically satisfy our performance obligation for valuation services as services are rendered over time.\nGlobal Workplace Solutions\nOur GWS segment provides a broad suite of integrated, contractually-based outsourcing services globally for occupiers of real estate, including facilities management, and project management services.\nFacilities Management and Project Management Services\nFacilities management involves the day-to-day management of client-occupied space and includes headquarters, regional offices, administrative offices, data centers and other critical facilities, manufacturing and laboratory facilities, distribution facilities and retail space. Contracts for facilities management services are often structured so we are reimbursed for client-dedicated personnel costs and subcontracted vendor costs as well as associated overhead expenses plus a monthly fee, and, in some cases, annual incentives tied to agreed upon performance targets, with any penalties typically capped. In addition, we have contracts for facilities management services based on fixed fees or guaranteed maximum prices. Fixed fee contracts are typically structured where an agreed upon scope of work is delivered for a fixed price while guaranteed maximum price contracts are structured with an agreed upon scope of work that will be provided to the client for a not to exceed price. Facilities management services represent a series of distinct daily services rendered over time. Consistent with the transfer of control for distinct, daily services to the customer, revenue is typically recognized at the end of each period for the fees associated with the services performed.\nProject management services are often provided on a portfolio wide or programmatic basis. Revenues from project management services generally include construction management, fixed management fees, variable fees, and incentive fees if certain agreed upon performance targets are met. Revenues from project management may also include reimbursement of payroll and related costs for personnel providing the services and subcontracted vendor costs. Project management services represent a series of distinct daily services rendered over time. Consistent with the transfer of control for distinct, daily services to the customer, revenue is typically recognized at the end of each period for the fees associated with the services performed.\nThe amount of revenue recognized is presented gross for any services provided by our employees, as we control them. This is evidenced by our obligation for their performance and our ability to direct and redirect their work, as well as negotiate the value of such services. The amount of revenue recognized related to the majority of facilities management contracts and certain project management arrangements is presented gross (with offsetting expense recorded in cost of revenue) for reimbursements of costs of third-party services because we control those services that are delivered to the client. In the instances when we do not control third-party services delivered to the client, we report revenues net of the third-party reimbursements.\n69\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nIn addition to our management fee, we receive various types of variable consideration which can include but is not limited to key performance indicator bonuses or penalties which may be linked to subcontractor performance, gross maximum price, glidepaths, savings guarantees, shared savings, or fixed fee structures. We assess variable consideration on a contract-by-contract basis, and when appropriate, recognize revenue based on our assessment of the outcome (using the most likely outcome approach or weighted probability) and historical results, if comparable and representative. Using management assessments and historical results and statistics, we recognize revenue if it is deemed probable there will not be significant reversal in the future.\nReal Estate Investments\nOur REI segment is comprised of investment management services provided globally and development services in the U.S., the U.K. and Continental Europe.\nInvestment Management Services\nOur investment management services are provided to pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments, and other institutional investors seeking to generate returns and diversification through investment in real assets. We sponsor investment programs that span the risk/return spectrum in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. We are typically compensated in the form of a base management fee, disposition fees, acquisition fees and incentive fees in the form of performance fees or carried interests based on fund type (open or closed ended, respectively). For the base management fees, we typically satisfy the performance obligation as service is rendered over time pursuant to the series guidance. Consistent with the transfer of control for distinct, daily services to the customer, revenue is recognized at the end of each period for the fees associated with the services performed. For acquisition and disposition services, we typically satisfy the performance obligation at a point in time (at acquisition or upon disposition). For contracts with contingent fees, including performance fees, incentive fees and carried interests, we assess variable consideration on a contract-by-contract basis, and when appropriate, recognize revenue based on our assessment of the outcome (using the most likely outcome approach or weighted probability) and historical results, if comparable and representative. Revenue associated with performance fees and carried interests are typically impacted by volatility in the real estate market, a broad range of possible outcomes, and other factors in the market that are outside of our control.\nDevelopment Services\nOur development services consist of real estate development and investment activities in the U.S., the U.K. and Europe to users of and investors in commercial real estate, as well as for our own account. \nWe pursue opportunistic, risk-mitigated development and investment in commercial real estate across a wide spectrum of property types, including industrial, office and retail properties; healthcare facilities of all types (medical office buildings, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers); and multi-family residential/mixed-use projects. We pursue development and investment activity on behalf of our clients on a fee basis with \nno\n, or limited, ownership interest in a property, in partnership with our clients through co-investment – either on an individual project basis or through programs with certain strategic capital partners or for our own account with \n100\n% ownership. Development services represent a series of distinct daily services rendered over time. Consistent with the transfer of control for distinct, daily services to the customer, revenue is recognized at the end of each period for the fees associated with the services performed. Fees are typically payable monthly over the service term or upon contractual defined events, like project milestones. In addition to development fee revenue, we receive various types of variable consideration which can include, but is not limited to, contingent lease-up bonuses, cost saving incentives, profit sharing on sales and at-risk fees. We assess variable consideration on a contract-by-contract basis, and when appropriate, recognize revenue based on our assessment of the outcome (using the most likely outcome approach or weighted probability) and historical results, if comparable and representative. We accelerate revenue if it is deemed probable there will not be significant reversal in the future. Sales of real estate to customers which are considered an output of ordinary activities are recognized as revenue when or as control of the assets are transferred to the customer.\n70\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record accounts receivable for our unconditional rights to consideration arising from our performance under contracts with customers. The carrying value of such receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents their estimated net realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts for specific accounts receivable balances based on historical collection trends, the age of outstanding accounts receivables and existing economic conditions associated with the receivables. Past-due accounts receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful. As a practical expedient, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service will be one year or less. We do not typically include extended payment terms in our contracts with customers.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent the aggregate transaction prices for contracts where our performance obligations have not yet been satisfied. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations in our property leasing business was not significant. We apply the practical expedient related to remaining performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and the practical expedient related to variable consideration from remaining performance obligations pursuant to the series guidance. All of our remaining performance obligations apply to one of these practical expedients.\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nContract assets represent assets for revenue that has been recognized in advance of billing the customer and for which the right to bill is contingent upon something other than the passage of time. This is common for contingent portions of commissions in brokerage, development and construction revenue in development services and incentive fees present in various businesses. Billing requirements vary by contract but are generally structured around fixed monthly fees, reimbursement of employee and other third-party costs, and the achievement or completion of certain contingent events.\nWhen we receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of the services contract, we record deferred revenue, which represents a contract liability. We recognize the contract liability as revenue once we have transferred control of the service to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria are met.\nContract assets and contract liabilities are determined for each contract on a net basis. For contract assets, we classify the short-term portion as a separate line item within current assets and the long-term portion as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For contract liabilities, we classify the short-term portion as a separate line item within current liabilities and the long-term portion within other liabilities, long-term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nContract Costs\nContract costs, accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 340-40, “\nOther Assets and Deferred Costs – Contracts with Customers\n,” primarily consist of upfront costs incurred to obtain or to fulfill a contract. These costs are typically found within our GWS segment. Such costs relate to transition costs to fulfill contracts prior to services being rendered and are included within other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized transition costs are amortized based on the transfer of services to which the assets relate which can vary on a contract-by-contract basis and are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Contract costs that are recognized as assets are reviewed for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nApplying the contract cost practical expedient, we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.\n71\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nBusiness Promotion and Advertising Costs\nThe costs of business promotion and advertising are expensed as incurred.\n Business promotion and advertising costs of $\n82\n million, $\n74\n million and $\n85\n million were included in operating, administrative and other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nForeign Currencies\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the U.S. are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate. The resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income/loss component of equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income/loss. In the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, accumulated other comprehensive income/loss primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, qualified derivative activities, unrealized holding gains on available for sale debt securities and pension liability adjustments. Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude any income tax effects given that earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time (see Note 15 – Income Taxes).\nWarehouse Receivables\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Capital Markets, Inc. (CBRE Capital Markets) is a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) approved Multifamily Program Plus Seller/Servicer and an approved Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Aggregation and Negotiated Transaction Seller/Servicer. In addition, CBRE Capital Markets’ wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc. (CBRE MCI) is an approved Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) Seller/Servicer and CBRE Capital Markets’ wholly-owned subsidiary CBRE HMF, Inc. (CBRE HMF) is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved Non-Supervised Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Title II Mortgagee, an approved Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender and an approved Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) issuer of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Under these arrangements, before loans are originated through proceeds from warehouse lines of credit, we obtain either a contractual loan purchase commitment from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS that will be secured by the loans. The warehouse lines of credit are generally repaid within a one-month period when Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae buys the loans or upon settlement of the Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS, while we retain the servicing rights. Loans are funded at the prevailing market rates. We elect the fair value option for all warehouse receivables. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS that will be secured by the underlying loans.\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)\nIn connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights on the date the loans are sold. Our MSRs are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized in proportion to and over the period that the servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows and assessed for impairment based on the fair value each reporting period. MSRs are recorded in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n72\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nOur initial recording of MSRs at their fair value resulted in net gains, as the fair value of servicing contracts that result in MSR assets exceeded the fair value of servicing contracts that result in MSR liabilities. The net assets and net gains are presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n \nThe amount of MSRs recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance, mortgage servicing rights\n$\n499\n \n$\n561\n \n$\n579\n \nMortgage servicing rights recognized\n125\n \n82\n \n146\n \nMortgage servicing rights sold\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAmortization expense\n(\n138\n)\n(\n144\n)\n(\n164\n)\nEnding balance, mortgage servicing rights\n$\n486\n \n$\n499\n \n$\n561\n \nMSRs do not actively trade in an open market with readily available observable prices; therefore, fair value is determined based on certain assumptions and judgments, including the estimation of the present value of future cash flows realized from servicing the underlying mortgage loans. Management’s assumptions include the benefits of servicing (servicing fee income and interest on escrow deposits), inflation, the cost of servicing, prepayment rates, delinquencies, discount rates and the estimated life of servicing cash flows. The assumptions used are subject to change based on management’s judgments and estimates of changes in future cash flows and interest rates, among other things. \nThe key assumptions used during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 in measuring fair value were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted average discount rate\n13.6\n \n%\n13.0\n \n%\n12.9\n \n%\nWeighted average conditional prepayment rate\n11.8\n \n%\n12.0\n \n%\n10.1\n \n%\nThe estimated fair value of our MSRs was $\n1.1\n billion, $\n1.2\n billion and $\n1.1\n billion as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We perform quarterly procedures to identify triggering events. Impairment is evaluated through a comparison of the carrying amount and fair value of the MSRs, and recognized with the establishment of a valuation allowance. We did not incur any impairment charges related to our MSRs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. \nNo\n valuation allowance was recognized for MSRs in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nIncluded in \nrevenue\n in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are contractually specified servicing fees from loans serviced for others of $\n329\n million, $\n315\n million and $\n309\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and includes prepayment fees/late fees earned from loans serviced for others of $\n9\n million, $\n5\n million and $\n23\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, also recorded in revenue, was ancillary income of $\n151\n million, $\n108\n million and $\n23\n million for years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, generated on the loan servicing float.\nAccounting for Broker Draws\nAs part of our recruitment efforts relative to new U.S. brokers, we offer a transitional broker draw arrangement. Our broker draw arrangements generally last until such time as a broker’s pipeline of business is sufficient to allow the broker to earn sustainable commissions. This program is intended to provide the broker with a minimal amount of cash flow to allow adequate time for his or her training as well as time for him or her to develop business relationships. Similar to traditional salaries, the broker draws are paid irrespective of the actual revenues generated by the broker. Often these broker draws represent the only form of compensation received by the broker. Furthermore, it is not our general policy to pursue collection of unearned broker draws paid under this arrangement. As a result, we have concluded that broker draws are economically equivalent to salaries paid and accordingly charge them to compensation expense as incurred over the service period. The broker is also entitled to earn a commission on completed revenue transactions, less any amounts previously paid to the broker in the form of a draw.\n73\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for all employee awards under the fair value recognition provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, “\nCompensation – Stock Compensation\n” (Topic 718). Topic 718 requires the measurement of compensation cost at the grant date, based upon the estimated fair value of the award, and requires amortization of the related expense over the employee’s requisite service period. We do not estimate forfeitures, but instead recognize forfeitures when they occur. See Note 14 – Employee Benefit Plans for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans.\nIncome Per Share\nBasic income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. is computed by dividing net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. generally further assumes the dilutive effect of potential common shares, which include certain contingently issuable shares. Contingently issuable shares consist of non-vested stock awards.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, “\nAccounting for Income Taxes.\n” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nSee Note 15 – Income Taxes for additional information on income taxes.\nSelf-Insurance\nOur wholly-owned captive insurance company, which is subject to applicable insurance rules and regulations, insures our exposure related to workers’ compensation insurance, general liability insurance and automotive insurance for our U.S. operations risk on a primary basis and we purchase excess coverage from unrelated insurance carriers. The captive insurance company also insures primary risk relating to professional indemnity claims globally. Given the nature of these types of claims, it may take several years for resolution and determination of the cost of these claims. We are required to estimate the cost of these claims in our financial statements.\nThe estimates that we utilize to record our potential losses on claims are inherently subjective, and actual claims could differ from amounts recorded, which could result in increased or decreased expense in future periods.\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our reserves for claims under these insurance programs were $\n197\n million and $\n180\n million, respectively, of which $\n4\n million and $\n4\n million, respectively, represented our estimated current liabilities.\n74\nTable of Contents\nCBRE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nContingencies\nPursuant to FASB ASC Topic 450, \n“Contingencies”\n (Topic 450),\n \nwe evaluate whether any conditions existed as of the financial statement issuance date which may result in a loss contingent upon one or more future events occurring or not occurring. Assessing contingent liabilities involves significant judgment. If the assessment indicates that a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable, we accrue an estimated liability in our financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of potential losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. We determine the amount of estimated liability to accrue, if any, after thorough evaluation of key information available that could impact the size and timing of the potential loss on a case-by-case basis. Given the significant judgment involved with such estimates, the potential liability may change in the future as new information becomes available. We do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is completely resolved and the associated amounts are probable of collection.\n \nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nWe record derivative instruments at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in either other liabilities or other assets. We do not net derivatives on our balance sheet. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the same financial statement line item. For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis. Cash flows arising from derivative instruments are classified within the consolidated statements of cash flows within the same category that the cash flows from the item being hedged. \nThe accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and whether we have elected to apply hedge accounting in a qualified hedging relationship. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we may elect not to apply hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently do not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. \nDerivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. We assess at the hedge’s inception, and continue to assess on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items. \nWe use fixed to fixed and float to float cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on certain foreign investments as well as a foreign currency denominated term loan (see Note 11 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings for additional information on the term loan). As of December 31, 2024, we had \nseven\n outstanding cross-currency swaps with a total fair value of $\n43\n million included in other assets to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates from a foreign currency denominated term loan and investments in foreign subsidiaries.\nEmployee Separation Benefits\nOne-time termination benefits are expensed at the date the company notifies the employee, unless the employee must provide future service, in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period. Ongoing benefits are expensed when restructuring activities are probable and the benefit amounts are estimable.\n75\n3.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, \n“Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions.”\n The amendments in the ASU clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The ASU introduces new disclosure requirements to provide investors with information about the restriction including the nature and remaining duration of the restriction. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2022-03 in the first quarter of 2024. The adoption did not have a material impact on the valuation of our equity securities. To the extent we have material equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, we have included the required disclosures within the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, \n“Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements.”\n This update requires that leasehold improvements associated with common control leases be amortized over the useful life of the leasehold improvements to the common control group (regardless of the lease term) and accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment to equity if, and when, the lessee no longer controls the use of the underlying asset. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2023-01 in the first quarter of 2024 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, \n“Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization method.”\n This update permits an accounting election to account for tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2023-02 in the first quarter of 2024 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \n“Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.”\n This update enhances reportable segment disclosures by requiring a public entity to: 1) disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, 2) disclose, on an annual and interim basis, an amount of other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition, 3) provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods, 4) disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, and 5) provide all the disclosures required by this update and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280 if the entity has a single reportable segment. This ASU also clarifies that, in addition to the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles under GAAP, a public entity is not precluded from reporting additional measures of a segment’s profit or loss that are used by the CODM in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of 2024 and have updated our segment disclosures to comply with the updated requirements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures.\n” This ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid and will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The new requirements should be applied on a prospective basis with an option to apply them retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n76\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “\nIncome Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.\n” This ASU requires public business entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027 with early adoption permitted. These requirements should be applied on a prospective basis with an option to apply them retrospectively. We are evaluating the impact that ASU 2024-03 will have on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n4.\nAcquisitions\nJ&J Worldwide Services Acquisition\nOn February 27, 2024, we acquired a \n100\n% ownership interest in J&J Worldwide Services (J&J), a leading provider of engineering services, base support operations and facilities maintenance for the U.S. federal government. J&J primarily serves the U.S. Department of Defense through long-term, fixed-price contracts and is reported as part of our Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) segment. The acquisition is consistent with key elements of our M&A strategy that focus on enhancing our technical services capabilities, increasing revenue resilience and secular growth, and expanding our government client base within our GWS segment.\nThe J&J acquisition was treated as a business combination under Topic 805 and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. We financed the acquisition with (i) the issuance in February 2024 of $\n500\n million in aggregate principal amount of \n5.500\n% senior notes due April 1, 2029; (ii) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility under our 2023 Credit Agreement; and (iii) cash on hand. See Note 11 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings for more information on the above-mentioned debt instruments.\nThe following summarizes the consideration transferred at closing for the J&J acquisition (dollars in millions):\nCash consideration\n$\n808\n \nDeferred and contingent consideration\n11\n \nTotal consideration\n$\n819\n \nThe purchase price included $\n7\n million of contingent consideration, representing the acquisition date fair value recognized for up to $\n250\n million gross of potential future earnout payments based on the achievement of certain performance thresholds during calendar years 2025 and 2026.\nThe following represents the summary of the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired (dollars in millions):\nPurchase price\n$\n819\n \nLess: Estimated fair value of net assets acquired (see table below)\n353\n \nExcess purchase price over estimated fair value of net assets acquired\n$\n466\n \nThe purchase accounting adjustments related to the J&J acquisition have been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and non-controlling interest has been recorded to goodwill. The goodwill arising from the J&J acquisition consists largely of the synergies and opportunities to deliver premier engineering services, base support operations and facilities maintenance services. Of the goodwill generated, approximately $\n115\n million is deductible for tax purposes.\n77\nThe acquired assets and assumed liabilities of J&J were recorded at their estimated fair values. The purchase price allocation for the business combination is primarily for intangibles and subject to change within the respective measurement period which will not extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments will be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Any such adjustments may be material.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values assigned to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date on February 27, 2024 (dollars in millions):\nAssets Acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n26\n \nReceivables, net\n91\n \nContract assets\n19\n \nPrepaid expenses\n2\n \nOther current assets\n2\n \nProperty and equipment, net\n11\n \nOther intangible assets, net\n297\n \nOperating lease assets\n6\n \nInvestments in unconsolidated subsidiaries\n20\n \nOther assets, net\n10\n \nTotal assets acquired\n484\n \nLiabilities Assumed:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n56\n \nCompensation and employee benefits payable\n10\n \nContract liabilities\n1\n \nIncome taxes payable\n1\n \nOther current liabilities\n3\n \nNon-current operating lease liabilities\n3\n \nDeferred tax liabilities, net\n48\n \nOther liabilities\n3\n \nTotal liabilities assumed\n125\n \nNon-controlling Interest Acquired\n6\n \nEstimated Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired\n$\n353\n \nIn connection with the J&J acquisition, below is a summary of the value allocated to the intangible assets acquired (dollars in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAsset Class\nAmortization\nPeriod\nAmount\nAssigned at\nAcquisition\nDate\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying\nValue\nCustomer relationships\n9\n-\n12\n years\n$\n174\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n162\n \nBacklog\n4\n-\n6\n years\n111\n \n21\n \n90\n \nTrademark\n3\n years\n10\n \n3\n \n7\n \nTechnology\n5\n years\n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \nThe fair value of customer relationships and backlog was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method (MPEEM), a form of the Income Approach. The MPEEM is a specific application of the Discounted Cash Flow Method. The principle behind the MPEEM is that the value of an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the incremental cash flows attributable only to the subject intangible asset. This estimation used certain unobservable key inputs such as timing of projected cash flows, growth rates, expected contract renewal probabilities, discount rates, and the assessment of useful life.\n78\nThe fair value of the trademark and the existing technology was determined by using the Relief-from-Royalty Method, a form of the Income Approach, and relied on key unobservable inputs such as timing of the projected cash flows, growth rates, and royalty rates. The basic tenet of the Relief-from-Royalty Method is that without ownership of the subject intangible asset, the user of that intangible asset would have to make a stream of payments to the owner of the asset in return for the rights to use that asset. By acquiring the intangible asset, the user avoids these payments.\nUnaudited pro forma results, assuming the J&J acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2023 for purposes of the pro forma disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented below. They include certain adjustments for increased amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired (approximately $\n3\n million and $\n19\n million in 2024 and 2023, respectively) as well as increased interest expense related to the long-term financing (approximately $\n4\n million and $\n28\n million in 2024 and 2023, respectively). Direct transaction and integration costs of $\n25\n million as well as the tax impact of all pro forma adjustments are also included in the unaudited pro forma results.\nThese unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the J&J acquisition occurred on January 1, 2023 and may not be indicative of future operating results (dollars in millions, except share and per share data):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nRevenue\n$\n35,839\n \n$\n32,411\n \nOperating income\n1,431\n \n1,079\n \nNet income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc.\n979\n \n933\n \nBasic income per share:\nNet income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc.\n$\n3.20\n \n$\n3.03\n \nWeighted average shares outstanding for basic income per share\n305,859,458\n \n308,430,080\n \nDiluted income per share:\nNet income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc.\n$\n3.18\n \n$\n2.99\n \nWeighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per share\n308,033,612\n \n312,550,942\n \n2024 Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024, the company completed \nnine\n in-fill business acquisitions, including \nthree\n in the Advisory Services segment and \nsix\n in the Global Workplace Solutions segment, with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $\n315\n million in cash and non-cash consideration. Assets acquired primarily relate to intangible assets (customer relationships, backlog, trademarks and goodwill); other assets and liabilities assumed are working capital in nature. The results of operations of all acquisitions completed during the year ended 2024 have been included in the company’s consolidated financial results since their respective acquisition dates.

Topic 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n•\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\nThe following tables present the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):\nDecember 31, 2024\nFair Value Measured and Recorded Using\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\nAvailable for sale debt securities:\nU.S. treasury securities\n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3\n \nCorporate debt securities\n—\n \n33\n \n—\n \n33\n \nAsset-backed securities\n—\n \n7\n \n—\n \n7\n \nTotal available for sale debt securities\n3\n \n40\n \n—\n \n43\n \nEquity securities\n18\n \n—\n \n—\n \n18\n \nInvestments in unconsolidated subsidiaries\n100\n \n—\n \n412\n \n512\n \nWarehouse receivables\n—\n \n561\n \n—\n \n561\n \nDerivative assets\n—\n \n43\n \n—\n \n43\n \nOther assets\n—\n \n—\n \n46\n \n46\n \nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n121\n \n$\n644\n \n$\n458\n \n$\n1,223\n \nLiabilities\nContingent consideration\n—\n \n—\n \n36\n \n36\n \nTotal liabilities at fair value\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n36\n \n82\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Value Measured and Recorded Using\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\nAvailable for sale debt securities:\nU.S. treasury securities\n$\n12\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n12\n \nDebt securities issued by U.S. federal agencies\n—\n \n11\n \n—\n \n11\n \nCorporate debt securities\n—\n \n44\n \n—\n \n44\n \nAsset-backed securities\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \nTotal available for sale debt securities\n12\n \n56\n \n—\n \n68\n \nEquity securities\n41\n \n—\n \n—\n \n41\n \nInvestments in unconsolidated subsidiaries\n168\n \n—\n \n477\n \n645\n \nWarehouse receivables\n—\n \n675\n \n—\n \n675\n \nOther assets\n—\n \n—\n \n16\n \n16\n \nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n221\n \n$\n731\n \n$\n493\n \n$\n1,445\n \nLiabilities\nContingent consideration\n—\n \n—\n \n36\n \n36\n \nDerivative liabilities\n—\n \n5\n \n—\n \n5\n \nTotal liabilities at fair value\n$\n—\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n41\n \nFair value measurements for our available for sale debt securities are obtained from independent pricing services which utilize observable market data that may include quoted market prices, dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument’s terms and conditions.\nDuring the year ended\n \nDecember 31, 2023, we recorded a gain of $\n34\n million associated with remeasuring our \n50\n% investment in a previously unconsolidated subsidiary to fair value as of the date we acquired the remaining \n50\n% controlling interest. Fair value of this investment in unconsolidated subsidiary at acquisition date was $\n37\n million, based upon the purchase price paid for the remaining \n50\n% interest acquired, which falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Such gain was reflected in other income in our Advisory Services segment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe equity securities are generally valued at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation or, if no sales occurred on the valuation date, at the mean of the bid and ask prices on such date. The above tables do not include $\n148\n million and $\n143\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to our capital investments in certain non-public entities as they are non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative, defined as cost minus impairment. These investments are included in “other assets, net” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. \nThe fair values of warehouse receivables are primarily calculated based on locked in purchase prices. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, all of the warehouse receivables included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans (See Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Warehouse Receivables & Warehouse Lines of Credit). These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as a substantial majority of inputs are readily observable.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries at fair value using NAV were $\n378\n million and $\n352\n million, respectively, and investments at fair value using NAV which are not accounted for under the equity method were $\n21\n million and $\n19\n million, respectively. These investments fall under practical expedient rules that do not require them to be included in the fair value hierarchy and as a result have been excluded from the tables above.\n83\nThe tables below present a reconciliation for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (dollars in millions):\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nOther Assets\nContingent Consideration\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n461\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n41\n \nTransfer in (out)\n—\n \n(\n10\n)\n—\n \nNet change in fair value\n16\n \n5\n \n(\n6\n)\nPurchases/ Additions\n—\n \n7\n \n20\n \nSales / Payments\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n19\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n477\n \n16\n \n36\n \nTransfer in (out)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nNet change in fair value\n(\n65\n)\n18\n \n(\n5\n)\nPurchases/ Additions\n—\n \n12\n \n11\n \nSales / Payments\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n6\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n412\n \n$\n46\n \n$\n36\n \nNet change in fair value, included in the table above, is reported in Net income as follows:\nCategory of Assets/Liabilities using Unobservable Inputs\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nInvestments in unconsolidated subsidiaries\nEquity (loss) income from unconsolidated subsidiaries\nOther assets (liabilities)\nOther income (loss)\nContingent consideration (short-term)\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\nContingent consideration (long-term)\nOther liabilities\nThe table below presents information about the significant unobservable inputs used for recurring fair value measurements for certain Level 3 instruments as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n:\nValuation Technique\nUnobservable Input\nInvestment in unconsolidated subsidiaries\nDiscounted cash flow\nDiscount rate\n13\n \n%\nMonte Carlo\nVolatility\n62\n \n%\nOther assets\nDiscounted cash flow\nDiscount rate\n13\n \n%\nContingent consideration\nMonte Carlo\nVolatility\n21\n \n%\nDiscount rate\n5\n \n%\nDiscounted estimated payments \n(1)\nDiscount rate\n5\n% - \n6\n%\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024, discounted estimated payments for Contingent Consideration had a weighted average of \n6\n%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded non-cash asset impairment charges of $\n9\n million related to one of our equity method investments. There were \nno\n asset impairment charges or other significant non-recurring fair value measurements recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded non-cash asset impairment charges of $\n59\n million. Approximately $\n10\n million of such charges related to the exit of our Advisory Services business in Russia (primarily comprised of receivables), and $\n26\n million and $\n22\n million related to goodwill and trade name impairment charges, respectively. The goodwill and the trade name impairment charges represent a full impairment of such assets associated with the Telford Homes business in our Real Estate Investments segment. The charges were attributable to the effects of elevated inflation on construction, materials and labor costs which increased Telford Homes’ risk as the contractor and reduced the profitability of current projects. The fair value measurements employed for our impairment evaluation of goodwill were based on a discounted cash flow approach and a relief from royalty fair value method for the trade name. Significant inputs used in the evaluation included a risk-free rate of return, estimated risk premium, terminal growth rates, working capital assumptions, royalty rate, income tax rates as well as other economic variables. These asset impairment charges were included within the line item “Asset impairments” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. \n84\nFASB ASC Topic 825, “\nFinancial Instruments,\n” requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our financial instruments are as follows:\n•\nCash and Cash Equivalents \nand\n Restricted Cash\n – These balances include cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash with maturities of less than three months. The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n•\nReceivables, less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n – Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.\n•\nWarehouse Receivables\n – These balances are carried at fair value. The primary source of value is either a contractual purchase commitment from Freddie Mac or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae MBS (see Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Warehouse Receivables & Warehouse Lines of Credit).\n•\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\n – A portion of these investments are carried at fair value as discussed above. It includes our equity investment and related interests in both public and non-public entities. Our ownership of common shares in Altus Power, Inc. (Altus) is considered level 1 and is measured at fair value using a quoted price in an active market. Our ownership of alignment shares of Altus and our investment in Industrious and certain other non-controlling equity investments are considered level 3 which are measured at fair value using Monte Carlo and discounted cash flows. The valuation of Altus’ common shares and alignment shares are dependent on its stock price which could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various market conditions. Transfer out activities from level 3 represents annual conversion of a portion of our alignment shares in Altus to its common shares (see Note 10 – Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries). \n•\nAvailable for Sale Debt Securities\n – Primarily held by our wholly-owned captive insurance company, these investments are carried at their fair value.\n•\nEquity Securities\n – Primarily held by our wholly-owned captive insurance company, these investments are carried at their fair value.\n•\nOther Assets and Liabilities \n– Includes the fair value of the unfunded commitment related to a revolving facility designated as Level 3. Valuations are based on discounted cash flow techniques, for which the significant inputs are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market comparables and recovery assumptions.\n•\nDerivative assets and liabilities \n– The fair value of cross-currency swaps reflects the net present value of expected payments and receipts under the swap agreement based on the market’s expectation of future spot foreign currency exchange rates. Additional inputs to the net present value calculation may include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk and discount rates. These are designated as Level 2.\n•\nContingent Consideration \n– The fair values of contingent consideration related to business acquisitions are estimated using Monte Carlo simulations or the probability-weighted present value of estimated future payments resulting from the achievement levels of financial targets.\n•\nShort-Term Borrowings\n – The majority of this balance represents outstanding amounts under our warehouse lines of credit of our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, and our revolving credit facilities. Due to the short-term nature and/or variable interest rates of these instruments, fair value approximates carrying value (see Note 5 – Warehouse Receivables & Warehouse Lines of Credit and Note 11 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings).\n85\n•\nSenior Term Loans and Senior Notes \n– The table below presents the estimated fair value and actual carrying value of our long-term debt (net of unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions). The estimated fair value is determined based on dealers’ quotes (which falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). The actual carrying value is presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount (see Note 11 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings).\nEstimated Fair Value\nCarrying Value\nFinancial instrument\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nSenior term loans\n$\n708\n \n$\n746\n \n$\n718\n \n$\n752\n \n5.950\n% senior notes\n1,033\n \n1,049\n \n976\n \n974\n \n4.875\n% senior notes\n600\n \n600\n \n599\n \n597\n \n5.500\n% senior notes\n509\n \n—\n \n496\n \n—\n \n2.500\n% senior notes\n426\n \n424\n \n492\n \n490\n \n•\nNotes Payable on Real Estate\n – As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of our notes payable on real estate, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, was $\n196\n million and $\n124\n million, respectively, and are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These borrowings have either fixed interest rates or floating interest rates at spreads added to a market index. Although it is possible that certain portions of our notes payable on real estate may have fair values that differ from their carrying values, based on the terms of such loans as compared to current market conditions, or other factors specific to the borrower entity, we do not believe that the fair value of our notes payable is significantly different than their carrying value.\n \n8.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consists of the following (dollars in millions):\nDecember 31,\nUseful Lives\n2024\n2023\nComputer hardware and software\n2\n-\n10\n years\n$\n1,489\n \n$\n1,341\n \nLeasehold improvements\n1\n-\n15\n years\n716\n \n658\n \nFurniture and equipment\n1\n-\n10\n years\n351\n \n298\n \nConstruction in progress\nN/A\n153\n \n186\n \nTotal cost\n2,709\n \n2,483\n \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n1,795\n \n1,576\n \nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n914\n \n$\n907\n \nDepreciation and amortization expense associated with property and equipment was $\n297\n million, $\n290\n million and $\n261\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were \nno\n asset impairment charges related to property and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nConstruction in progress includes capitalizable costs incurred during the development stage of computer software and leasehold improvements that have not yet been placed in service.\n86\n9.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nOur annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year. We performed the 2024, 2023 and 2022 annual assessments as of October 1 and determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value.\nDuring 2022, we identified a triggering event due to changing market conditions in our Real Estate Investments segment for the Telford Homes business. We recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $\n26\n million associated with this reporting unit attributable to the effects of elevated inflation on construction, materials and labor costs, driving an increase in Telford Homes’ risk as the contractor and reducing the profitability of current projects. \nThe following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):\nAdvisory\nServices\nGlobal\nWorkplace\nSolutions\nReal Estate\nInvestments\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\nGoodwill\n$\n3,283\n \n$\n2,110\n \n$\n595\n \n$\n5,988\n \nAccumulated impairment losses\n(\n762\n)\n(\n175\n)\n(\n183\n)\n(\n1,120\n)\n2,521\n \n1,935\n \n412\n \n4,868\n \nAcquisitions\n91\n \n93\n \n3\n \n187\n \nForeign exchange movement\n9\n \n57\n \n8\n \n74\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nGoodwill\n3,383\n \n2,260\n \n606\n \n6,249\n \nAccumulated impairment losses\n(\n762\n)\n(\n175\n)\n(\n183\n)\n(\n1,120\n)\n2,621\n \n2,085\n \n423\n \n5,129\n \nAcquisitions\n8\n \n589\n \n—\n \n597\n \nForeign exchange movement\n(\n33\n)\n(\n60\n)\n(\n12\n)\n(\n105\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\nGoodwill\n3,358\n \n2,789\n \n594\n \n6,741\n \nAccumulated impairment losses\n(\n762\n)\n(\n175\n)\n(\n183\n)\n(\n1,120\n)\n$\n2,596\n \n$\n2,614\n \n$\n411\n \n$\n5,621\n \nOther intangible assets totaled $\n2.3\n billion, net of accumulated amortization of $\n2.5\n billion as of December 31, 2024, and $\n2.1\n billion, net of accumulated amortization of $\n2.2\n billion as of December 31, 2023 and are comprised of the following (dollars in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nUnamortizable intangible assets:\nManagement contracts\n$\n58\n \n$\n62\n \nTrademarks\n309\n \n317\n \n367\n \n379\n \nAmortizable intangible assets:\nCustomer relationships\n2,021\n \n$\n(\n1,031\n)\n1,727\n \n$\n(\n893\n)\nMortgage servicing rights\n1,134\n \n(\n648\n)\n1,055\n \n(\n556\n)\nTrademarks/Trade names\n342\n \n(\n177\n)\n315\n \n(\n147\n)\nManagement contracts\n133\n \n(\n133\n)\n122\n \n(\n121\n)\nOther\n795\n \n(\n505\n)\n662\n \n(\n462\n)\n4,425\n \n(\n2,494\n)\n3,881\n \n(\n2,179\n)\nTotal intangible assets\n$\n4,792\n \n$\n(\n2,494\n)\n$\n4,260\n \n$\n(\n2,179\n)\n87\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets include management contracts identified as a result of the ING Group N.V. (ING) Real Estate Investment Management (REIM) operations in Europe and Asia, as well as substantially all of Clarion Real Estate Securities (CRES) in 2011 (collectively referred to as the REIM Acquisitions) relating to relationships with open-end funds, a trademark separately identified as a result of the CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE Services) in 2001 (the 2001 Acquisition), a trade name separately identified in connection with the REIM Acquisitions and a trademark separately identified as part of the Turner & Townsend transaction.\nCustomer relationships relate to existing relationships acquired through acquisitions mainly in our Global Workplace Solutions segment that are being amortized over useful lives of up to \n20\n years.\nMortgage servicing rights represent the carrying value of servicing assets in the U.S. in our Advisory Services segment. The mortgage servicing rights are being amortized over the estimated period that net servicing income is expected to be received, which is typically up to \n10\n years. See Mortgage Servicing Rights discussion within Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.\nTrademarks are primarily from our 2015 acquisition of the Global Workplace Solutions business from Johnson Controls, Inc., which are being amortized over \n20\n years. During 2022, we recorded a non-cash impairment of approximately $\n22\n million for trademarks associated with our Telford Homes business in the Real Estate Investments segment due to the impact of the inflationary conditions on construction materials negatively impacting cash flows (see Note 7 – Fair Value Measurements).\nManagement contracts consist primarily of asset management contracts relating to relationships with closed-end funds and separate accounts in the U.S., Europe and Asia that were separately identified as a result of the REIM Acquisitions. These management contracts are being amortized over useful lives of up to \n13\n years.\nOther amortizable intangible assets mainly represent upfront transition costs incurred to obtain or fulfill contracts prior to services being rendered which primarily get amortized to cost of revenue over the life of the associated contract. It also includes a backlog related intangible identified as part of the Turner & Townsend transaction.\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets, excluding amortization of transition costs, was $\n363\n million, $\n322\n million and $\n348\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The estimated annual amortization expense, excluding amortization of transition costs, for each of the years ending December 31, 2025 through December 31, 2029 and thereafter approximates $\n339\n million, $\n281\n million, $\n243\n million, $\n191\n million, $\n165\n million and $\n529\n million, respectively.\n88\n10.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nInvestments in unconsolidated subsidiaries are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

On July 10, 2023, CBRE Group, Inc., CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE Services) and Relam Amsterdam Holdings B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Services, entered into a new \n5-year\n senior unsecured Credit Agreement (2023 Credit Agreement) maturing on July 10, 2028, which refinanced and replaced a prior credit agreement. The 2023 Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured term loan credit facility comprised of (i) tranche A Euro-denominated term loans in an aggregate principal amount of €\n367\n million and (ii) tranche A U.S. Dollar-denominated term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $\n350\n million, both requiring quarterly principal payments beginning on December 31, 2024 and continuing through maturity on July 10, 2028. The proceeds of the term loans under the 2023 Credit Agreement were applied to the repayment of all remaining outstanding senior term loans under the prior 2022 Credit Agreement, the payment of related fees and expenses and other general corporate purposes. We entered into a cross-currency swap to hedge the associated foreign currency exposure related to this transaction. \n90\nBorrowings denominated in euros under the 2023 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the applicable percentage plus (ii) at our option, either (1) the EURIBOR rate for the applicable interest period or (2) a rate determined by reference to Daily Simple Euro Short-Term Rate (ESTR). Borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars under the 2023 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the applicable percentage, plus (ii) at our option, either (1) the Term SOFR rate for the applicable interest period plus \n10\n basis points (Adjusted Term SOFR) or (2) a base rate determined by the reference to the greatest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (z) the sum of (A) Term SOFR rate published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited for an interest period of one month and (B) \n1.00\n%. The applicable rate for borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement is determined by reference to our Credit Rating (as defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement). As of December 31, 2024, we had (i) $\n374\n million of euro term loan borrowings outstanding under the 2023 Credit Agreement (at an interest rate of \n1.25\n% plus EURIBOR) and (ii) $\n344\n million of U.S. Dollar term loan borrowings outstanding under the 2023 Credit Agreement (at an interest rate of \n1.25\n% plus Adjusted Term SOFR), net of unamortized debt issuance costs, included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe term loan borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement are guaranteed on a senior basis by CBRE Group, Inc. and CBRE Services.\nThe 2023 Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement) to consolidated interest expense of \n2.00\nx and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement) of \n4.25\nx (and in the case of the first four full fiscal quarters following consummation of a qualified acquisition (as defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement), \n4.75\nx) as of the end of each fiscal quarter.

As of December 31, 2023, \nno\n amount was outstanding under this revolving credit facility. Letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business and would reduce the amount we may borrow under this revolving credit facility.\nCommercial Paper Program\nOn December 2, 2024, CBRE Services established a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue and sell up to $\n3.5\n billion of short-term, unsecured and unsubordinated commercial paper notes with up to \n397-day\n maturities, under the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. Payment of the commercial paper notes is guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by CBRE Group, Inc. The program notes and the guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The proceeds from issuances under the program may be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, we had $\n175\n million in borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program with a weighted average annual interest rate of \n4.77\n%. At any point in time, the company intends to maintain available commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement in an amount at least equal to the amount of the commercial paper notes outstanding.\nTurner & Townsend\n \nRevolving Credit Facility\nTurner & Townsend maintains a £\n120\n million revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement dated March 31, 2022, with an additional accordion option of £\n20\n million, that matures on March 31, 2027. As of December 31, 2024, $\n44\n million (£\n35\n million) was outstanding under this revolving credit facility bearing interest at SONIA plus \n0.78\n%. As of December 31, 2023, $\n10\n million (£\n8\n million) was outstanding under this revolving credit facility.\nWarehouse Lines of Credit\nCBRE Capital Markets has warehouse lines of credit with third-party lenders for the purpose of funding mortgage loans that will be resold, and a funding arrangement with Fannie Mae for the purpose of selling a percentage of certain closed multifamily loans to Fannie Mae. These warehouse lines are recourse only to CBRE Capital Markets and related subsidiaries, based on the related deal type, which are secured by our related warehouse receivables.

We believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued as liabilities on our consolidated financial statements are unlikely to be significant, but litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated.\nIn January 2008, CBRE MCI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae under Fannie Mae’s Delegated Underwriting and Servicing Lender Program (DUS Program) to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units. Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and typically, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program. CBRE MCI has funded loans with unpaid principal balances of $\n45.5\n billion at December 31, 2024, of which $\n42.1\n billion is subject to such loss sharing arrangements. CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves or other acceptable collateral under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, CBRE MCI had $\n160\n million and $\n140\n million, respectively, of letters of credit under this reserve arrangement and had recorded a liability of approximately $\n63\n million and $\n67\n million, respectively, for its loan loss guarantee obligation under such arrangement. Fannie Mae’s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which assets totaled approximately $\n1.8\n billion (including $\n232\n million of warehouse receivables, which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at December 31, 2024.\nCBRE Capital Markets participates in Freddie Mac’s Multifamily Small Balance Loan (SBL) Program. Under the SBL program, CBRE Capital Markets has certain repurchase and loss reimbursement obligations. We could potentially be obligated to repurchase any SBL loan originated by CBRE Capital Markets that remains in default for 120 days following the forbearance period, if the default occurred during the first 12 months after origination and such loan had not been earlier securitized. In addition, CBRE Capital Markets may be responsible for a loss not to exceed \n10\n% of the original principal amount of any SBL loan that is not securitized and goes into default after the 12-month repurchase period. CBRE Capital Markets must post a cash reserve or other acceptable collateral to provide for sufficient capital in the event the obligations are triggered. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, CBRE Capital Markets had posted a $\n5\n million letter of credit under this reserve arrangement.\nLetters of credit\nWe had outstanding letters of credit totaling $\n272\n million as of December 31, 2024, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheets related to our subsidiaries’ outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases. The CBRE Capital Markets letters of credit totaling $\n165\n million as of December 31, 2024 referred to in the preceding paragraphs represented the majority of the $\n272\n million outstanding letters of credit as of such date. The remaining letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.\nGuarantees\nWe had guarantees totaling $\n211\n million as of December 31, 2024, excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities, operating leases, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheets. The $\n211\n million primarily represents guarantees executed by us in the ordinary course of business, including various guarantees of management and vendor contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2024, we had issued numerous non-recourse carveout, completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects for the benefit of third parties. These guarantees are commonplace in our industry and are made by us in the ordinary course of our REI business. Non-recourse carveout guarantees generally require that our project-entity borrower not commit specified improper acts, with us potentially liable for all or a portion of such entity’s indebtedness or other damages suffered by the lender if those acts occur. Completion and budget guarantees generally require us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget. While there can be no assurance, we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.\n96\nPerformance and payment bonds\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are required by certain customers to provide performance and payment bonds for contractual commitments related to our projects. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that the company will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay our subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay our subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the surety for expenses or outlays it incurs. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, outstanding performance and payment bonds approximated $\n808\n million and $\n242\n million, respectively.\nDeferred and contingent consideration\nThe purchase price for our business acquisitions often includes deferred and contingent consideration. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had short-term deferred and contingent consideration of $\n199\n million and $\n264\n million, respectively, which was included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses, and long-term deferred and contingent consideration of $\n93\n million and $\n266\n million, respectively, which was included within Other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nIndirect Taxes\nThe company is subject to indirect taxes, including sales and use tax in the United States and value-add tax in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts business. The Company has indirect tax liabilities totaling $\n91\n million and $\n3\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Indirect tax liabilities are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination, further interpretation of existing tax law, or new tax law. We are currently under audit in several jurisdictions. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450, \n“Contingencies,”\n the company establishes accruals for contingencies, including uncertainties related to taxes not based on income, when the company believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nOther \nAn important part of the strategy for our REI segment involves co-investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients. For our investment funds, we generally co-invest a minority interest of the equity in a particular fund. As of December 31, 2024, we had aggregate future commitments of $\n205\n million related to co-investment funds. Additionally, we make selective investments in real estate development projects on our consolidated account or co-invest with our clients with up to \n50\n% of the project’s equity as a principal in unconsolidated real estate projects. We had unfunded capital commitments of $\n330\n million and $\n67\n million to consolidated and unconsolidated projects, respectively, as of December 31, 2024.\nAlso refer to Note 22 – Telford Fire Safety Remediation for the details relating to the provision.\n14.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nStock Incentive Plans\n2017 Equity Incentive Plan\nOur 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on May 19, 2017. The 2017 Plan authorized the grant of stock-based awards to our employees, directors and independent contractors. Our 2017 Plan was terminated in May 2019 in connection with the adoption of our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2019 Plan), which is described below. At termination of the 2017 Plan, no unissued shares from the 2017 Plan were allocated to the 2019 Plan for potential future issuance. As of December 31, 2024, \nno\n restricted stock unit (RSU) awards to acquire shares of our Class A common stock granted under the 2017 Plan remain outstanding according to their terms, and we will not issue any further shares under this plan. Shares underlying awards outstanding under the 2017 Plan at termination that are subsequently canceled, forfeited or terminated without issuance to the holder thereof will be available for grant under the 2019 Plan.\n97\n2019 Equity Incentive Plan\nOur 2019 Plan was adopted by our board of directors on March 1, 2019 and approved by our stockholders on May 17, 2019. The 2019 Plan authorizes the grant of stock-based awards to employees, directors and independent contractors. Unless terminated earlier, the 2019 Plan will terminate on March 1, 2029. A total of \n9,900,000\n shares of our Class A common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan, less \n189,499\n shares granted under the 2017 Plan between March 1, 2019, the date our board of directors approved the plan, and May 17, 2019, the date our stockholders approved the 2019 Plan. Additionally, as mentioned above, shares underlying awards outstanding under the 2017 Plan at termination that are subsequently canceled, forfeited or terminated without issuance to the holder thereof will be available for reissuance under the 2019 Plan. On May 27, 2022, an additional \n7,700,000\n shares of our Class A common stock was reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, \n996,395\n shares were cancelled and \n1,601,597\n shares were withheld for payment of taxes under the 2017 Plan and added to the authorized pool for the 2019 Plan, bringing the total authorized amount under the 2019 Plan to \n20,008,493\n shares of our Class A common stock.\nShares underlying expired, canceled, forfeited or terminated awards under the 2019 Plan (other than awards granted in substitution of an award previously granted), plus those utilized to pay tax withholding obligations with respect to an award (other than an option or stock appreciation right) will be available for reissuance. Awards granted under the 2019 Plan are subject to a minimum vesting condition of \none year\n. As of December 31, 2024, assuming the maximum number of shares under our performance-based awards will later be issued, \n9,014,472\n shares remained available for future grants under this plan.\nThe number of shares issued or reserved pursuant to the 2017 Plan and 2019 Plan are subject to adjustment on account of a stock split of our outstanding shares, stock dividend, dividend payable in a form other than shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of the shares, consolidation, combination or reclassification of the shares, recapitalization, spin-off, or other similar occurrences.\nNon-Vested Stock Awards\nWe have issued non-vested stock awards, including RSUs and restricted shares, in our Class A common stock to certain of our employees, independent contractors and members of our board of directors. The following is a summary of the awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we granted RSUs that are performance vesting in nature, with \n826,883\n reflecting the maximum number of RSUs that may be issued if all of the performance targets are satisfied at their highest levels, and \n1,168,506\n RSUs that are time vesting in nature.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we granted RSUs that are performance vesting in nature, with \n896,742\n reflecting the maximum number of RSUs that may be issued if all of the performance targets are satisfied at their highest levels, and \n1,216,384\n RSUs that are time vesting in nature.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we granted RSUs that are performance vesting in nature, with \n1,223,849\n reflecting the maximum number of RSUs that may be issued if all of the performance targets are satisfied at their highest levels, and \n1,154,113\n RSUs that are time vesting in nature.\nOur annual performance-vesting awards generally vest in full \nthree years\n from the grant date, based on our achievement against various performance targets. Our time-vesting awards generally vest \n25\n% per year over \nfour years\n from the grant date.\nWe made a special grant of RSUs under our 2017 Plan (2017 Special RSU grant) to certain of our employees, with \n3,288,618\n reflecting the maximum number of RSUs that may be issued if all of the performance targets are satisfied at their highest levels, and \n939,605\n RSUs that are time vesting in nature. \nDuring \n2021, we granted additional RSUs under this program to certain of our employees, with \n146,080\n reflecting the maximum number of RSUs that may be issued if all of the performance targets are satisfied at their highest levels. There were \nno\n time vesting RSUs associated with the 2021 grants. As a condition to this 2017 Special RSU grant, each participant has agreed to execute a Restrictive Covenants Agreement. Each 2017 Special RSU grant (except the ones granted during 2021, which are all performance based) consisted of:\n(i)\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR) Performance RSUs with respect to \n33.3\n% of the total number of target RSUs subject to the grant. The actual number of TSR Performance RSUs that vested on December 1, 2023, was determined by measuring our cumulative TSR against the cumulative TSR of each of the other companies comprising the S&P 500 on the grant date (the Comparison Group) over a \nsix-year\n measurement period \n98\ncommencing on the grant date and ending on December 1, 2023. For purposes of measuring TSR, the initial value of our common stock was the average closing price of such common stock for the \n60\n trading days immediately preceding the grant date and the final value of our common stock was the average closing price of such common stock for the \n60\n trading days immediately preceding December 1, 2023.\n(ii)\nTime Vesting RSUs with respect to \n33.3\n% of the total number of target RSUs subject to the grant.\n(iii)\nEPS Performance RSUs with respect to \n33.3\n% of the total number of target RSUs subject to the grant.

As a condition to this Segment RSU grant, each participant has agreed to execute a Restrictive Covenants Agreement. Each Segment RSU grant consisted of:\n(i)\nSegment Performance RSUs with respect to \n33.3\n% of the total number of target RSUs subject to the grant. The actual number of Segment Performance RSUs that will vest is determined by measuring growth in certain segment specific metrics such as client operating profit, segment operating profit and major markets over a five-year measurement period commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2026.\n(ii)\nTime Vesting RSUs with respect to \n33.3\n% of the total number of target RSUs subject to the grant, which cliff vests on November 10, 2026.\n(iii)\nEPS Performance RSUs with respect to \n33.3\n% of the total number of target RSUs subject to the grant.

As a condition to this 2022 Special RSU grant, the CEO has agreed to execute a Restrictive Covenants Agreement. This 2022 Special RSU grant consisted of:\n(i)\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR) Performance RSUs with respect to \n33.3\n% of the total number of target RSUs subject to the grant. The actual number of TSR Performance RSUs that will vest is determined by measuring our cumulative TSR against the cumulative TSR of each of the other companies comprising the S&P 500 on the Grant Date (the Comparison Group) over a \nfive-year\n measurement period commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2026. For purposes of measuring TSR, the initial value of our common stock was the average closing price of such common stock for the \n60\n trading days immediately preceding January 1, 2022, and the final value of our common stock will be the average closing price of such common stock for the \n60\n trading days immediately preceding December 31, 2026.\n(ii)\nTime Based RSUs with respect to \n33.3\n% of the total number of target RSUs subject to the grant, vesting on February 25, 2027.\n(iii)\nEPS Performance RSUs with respect to \n33.3\n% of the total number of target RSUs subject to the grant. The actual number of EPS Performance RSUs that will vest is determined by measuring our cumulative adjusted income per share growth against the cumulative EPS growth, as reported under GAAP (GAAP EPS), of each of the other members of the Comparison Group over a \nfive-year\n measurement period commencing on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2026. These RSUs vest on December 31, 2026.\n99\nIn March 2024, we issued a portion of the 2024 annual performance awards under our 2019 Plan with TSR conditions, with \n385,878\n reflecting the maximum number of RSUs that may be issued if all of the performance targets are satisfied at their highest levels. \nWe estimated the fair value of the TSR Performance RSUs referred to above on the date of the grant using a Monte Carlo simulation with the following assumptions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2022\nVolatility of common stock\n29.9\n \n%\n35.6\n \n%\nExpected dividend yield\n0.0\n \n%\n0.0\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.2\n \n%\n1.8\n \n%\nA summary of the status of our non-vested stock awards is presented in the table below:\nShares/Units\nWeighted Average\nMarket Value\nPer Share\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n6,848,791\n \n$\n64.10\n \nGranted\n1,796,196\n \n95.01\n \nPerformance award achievement adjustments\n409,851\n \n77.99\n \nVested\n(\n1,372,123\n)\n57.74\n \nForfeited\n(\n269,636\n)\n79.33\n \nBalance at December 31, 2022\n7,413,079\n \n73.67\n \nGranted\n1,664,755\n \n78.46\n \nPerformance award achievement adjustments\n365,965\n \n81.14\n \nVested\n(\n4,001,675\n)\n59.62\n \nForfeited\n(\n221,545\n)\n81.14\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n5,220,579\n \n86.17\n \nGranted\n1,609,510\n \n95.89\n \nPerformance award achievement adjustments\n(\n302,282\n)\n111.72\n \nVested\n(\n1,729,161\n)\n75.67\n \nForfeited\n(\n341,324\n)\n89.27\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n4,457,322\n \n91.78\n \nTotal compensation expense related to non-vested stock awards was $\n146\n million, $\n96\n million and $\n160\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2024, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards was approximately $\n186\n million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately \n2.3\n years.\nBonuses\nWe have bonus programs covering select employees, including senior management. Awards are based on the position and performance of the employee and the achievement of pre-established financial, operating and strategic objectives. The amounts charged to operating expense for bonuses were $\n727\n million, $\n697\n million and $\n843\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n401(k) Plan\nOur CBRE 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan) is a defined contribution savings plan that allows participant deferrals under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Most of our U.S. employees, other than qualified real estate agents having the status of independent contractors under section 3508 of the IRC of 1986, as amended, and non-plan electing union employees, are eligible to participate in the plan. The 401(k) Plan provides for participant contributions as well as a company match. A participant is allowed to contribute to the 401(k) Plan from \n1\n% to \n75\n% of his or her compensation, subject to limits imposed by applicable law. Active participants vest in company match contributions at \n33\n% per year for each plan year they are employed. For 2022, we contributed a \n67\n% match on the first \n6\n% of annual compensation for participants with an annual base \n100\nsalary of less than $\n100,000\n and we contributed a \n50\n% match on the first \n6\n% of annual compensation for participants with an annual base salary of $\n100,000\n or more, or who are commissioned employees (up to $\n6,000\n of compensation). For 2024 and 2023, we contributed \n67\n% on the first \n6\n% of eligible compensation contributed to the plan (up to $\n6,000\n) for all employees regardless of base compensation or commissioned status. In connection with the 401(k) Plan, we charged to expense $\n121\n million, $\n108\n million and $\n91\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nParticipants are entitled to invest up to \n25\n% of their 401(k) account balance in shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2024, approximately \n1.0\n million shares of our common stock were held as investments by participants in our 401(k) Plan.\n101\nPension Plans\nWe have \ntwo\n primary non-U.S. contributory defined benefit pension plans (major plans), both based in the U.K. Our subsidiaries maintain these plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in these plans. With respect to these plans, our historical policy has been to contribute annually to the plans, an amount to fund pension liabilities as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations. Our contributions to these plans are invested by the plan trustee and, if these investments do not perform well in the future, we may be required to provide additional contributions to cover any pension underfunding. Effective July 1, 2007, we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits. In return, the active members became eligible to enroll in a defined contribution plan. For these plans, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of pension plan assets were $\n262\n million and $\n243\n million, respectively, and the fair values of projected benefit obligations were $\n236\n million and $\n267\n million, respectively. As a result, these plans were overfunded by approximately $\n26\n million and underfunded by approximately $\n24\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The projected benefit obligation on the major plans included $\n27\n million of gains due to actuarial assumptions in 2024 and $\n7\n million of losses due to plan experience in 2023.\nItems not yet recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost (benefit) for the major plans were $\n125\n million and $\n132\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, the trustees of the major pension plans entered into a buy-in agreement with a third-party insurance company. The buy-in arrangement is an insurance contract providing substantially all future benefit plan payments to the pension plan participants. However, the primary benefit obligation remains with the Company. The buy-in arrangement also allows for the possible future conversion into a buy-out arrangement where the insurance company would assume full responsibility for the pension plan obligations, at which time the Company would derecognize the assets and liabilities of the pension plan and realize a settlement loss as a component of the net periodic pension cost.\nAs of December 31, 2024, for all plans where total projected benefit obligations exceed plan assets, projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets were $\n113\n million and $\n51\n million, respectively, and $\n374\n million and $\n295\n million as of December 31, 2023, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, for all plans where total accumulated benefit obligations exceed plan assets, accumulated benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets were $\n96\n million and $\n51\n million, respectively, and $\n361\n million and $\n295\n million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. \nNet periodic pension cost (benefit) for all plans was $\n18\n million, $\n20\n million, and $(\n3\n) million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table provides amounts recognized related to all of our defined benefit pension plans within the following captions on our consolidated balance sheets (dollars in millions): \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nOther assets, net\n$\n64\n \n$\n41\n \nOther liabilities\n70\n \n85\n \nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024.

The recognition of the outside tax basis differences generated a capital loss that offset capital gains generated during 2022. The remaining capital loss will be carried back and then forward to offset future capital gains. Based on our strong history of capital gains in the prior three years and the nature of our business, we expect to generate sufficient capital gains in the five-year carry forward period and therefore concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize the full tax benefit from the capital loss carried forward. Accordingly, we have not provided any valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for the capital loss carried forward.\n103\nCumulative tax effects of temporary differences are shown below (dollars in millions):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nAssets:\nTax losses and tax credits\n$\n591\n \n$\n506\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n407\n \n343\n \nBonus and deferred compensation\n372\n \n334\n \nBad debt and other reserves\n130\n \n117\n \nAll other\n295\n \n188\n \nDeferred tax assets, before valuation allowance\n$\n1,795\n \n$\n1,488\n \nLess: Valuation allowance\n(\n396\n)\n(\n357\n)\nDeferred tax assets\n$\n1,399\n \n$\n1,131\n \nLiabilities:\nProperty and equipment\n(\n34\n)\n(\n55\n)\nUnconsolidated affiliates and partnerships\n(\n104\n)\n(\n115\n)\nCapitalized costs and intangibles\n(\n555\n)\n(\n531\n)\nOperating lease assets\n(\n351\n)\n(\n286\n)\nAll other\n(\n64\n)\n(\n38\n)\nDeferred tax liabilities\n$\n(\n1,108\n)\n$\n(\n1,025\n)\nNet deferred tax assets\n$\n291\n \n$\n106\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, there were deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of approximately $\n530\n million related to U.S. federal, state, and foreign net operating losses (NOLs). The majority of the NOLs are carried forward indefinitely and primarily related to the foreign jurisdictions. In certain foreign jurisdictions NOLs expire each year beginning in 2024. The utilization of NOLs may be subject to certain limitations under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws. As of December 31, 2024, we had a U.S. federal and state capital loss carryforward, net of reserves for uncertain tax position, of approximately $\n42\n million which will expire after 2027, and $\n24\n million foreign tax credits, which will expire after 2033. We have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets where we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax attributes will not be utilized.\nWe determined as of December 31, 2024, $\n396\n million of deferred tax assets do not satisfy the realization criteria set forth in Topic 740. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded for this amount. If released, the entire amount would result in a benefit to continuing operations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, our valuation allowance increased by approximately $\n39\n million. The increase was attributed to a build in valuation allowance of $\n68\n million due to current year activities, reversal of the beginning of year valuation allowance of $\n4\n million as certain foreign subsidiaries expect to utilize deferred tax assets before expiration as a result of current and forecasted earnings within the applicable jurisdiction as well as expected utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits, and a decrease of $\n25\n million due to foreign currency translation and tax rate changes. We believe it is more likely than not that future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2024, net of valuation allowance.\nAt December 31, 2024, we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $\n4.3\n billion for which we have indefinitely reinvested and not recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax is not practicable due to the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to estimate the tax. As of December 31, 2024, we have recorded $\n25\n million of deferred tax liability relating to book over tax basis in Turner & Townsend undistributed earnings and for any subsidiaries not considered indefinitely reinvested.\nThe total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $\n347\n million and $\n413\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of $\n66\n million resulted from a release of $\n80\n million of gross unrecognized tax benefits due to audit closure, accrual of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $\n25\n million, and a release of $\n11\n million of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of statute of limitations in various tax jurisdictions. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate, if recognized, is $\n216\n million as of December 31, 2024.\n104\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nBeginning balance, unrecognized tax benefits\n$\n(\n413\n)\n$\n(\n391\n)\nGross increases - tax positions in prior period\n(\n9\n)\n(\n12\n)\nGross decreases - tax positions in prior period\n3\n \n1\n \nGross increases - current-period tax positions\n(\n21\n)\n(\n18\n)\nDecreases relating to settlements\n80\n \n—\n \nReductions as a result of lapse of statute of limitations\n11\n \n7\n \nForeign exchange movement\n2\n \n—\n \nEnding balance, unrecognized tax benefits\n$\n(\n347\n)\n$\n(\n413\n)\nOur continuing practice is to recognize accrued interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters within income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we accrued an additional $\n4\n million and $\n3\n million, respectively, in interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2024, we have recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $\n10\n million. We believe the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits that will be settled during the next twelve months due to filing amended returns and settling ongoing exams will not be significant.\nWe conduct business globally and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in multiple state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. We are under audit by various states and cities including California, Massachusetts, New York, New York City, and Texas. We are also under audit by various foreign tax jurisdictions including France, Germany, and Spain. With limited exception, our significant U.S. state and foreign tax jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit by the various tax authorities for tax years prior to 2013 and 2017, respectively.\n105\n16.\nStockholders’ Equity\nOur board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations imposed by law, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue a total of \n25,000,000\n shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with each such series having rights and preferences including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as our board of directors may determine. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nno\n shares of preferred stock have been issued. \nOur board of directors is authorized to issue up to \n525,000,000\n shares of Class A common stock, $\n0.01\n par value per share (common stock), of which \n302,052,229\n shares and \n304,889,140\n shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn November 21, 2024, our board of directors authorized an additional $\n5.0\n billion to our existing $\n4.0\n billion share repurchase program (as amended, the 2024 program) bringing the total authorized amount under the 2024 program to a total of $\n9.0\n billion as of December 31, 2024. The board also extended the term of the 2024 program through December 31, 2029. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased \n5,110,624\n shares of our common stock with an average price of $\n126.02\n per share using cash on hand for an aggregate of $\n644\n million under the 2024 program. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we repurchased \n7,867,348\n shares and \n22,890,606\n shares of our common stock using cash on hand for an aggregate of $\n650\n million and $\n1.9\n billion.\nOur stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future repurchases with existing cash. We may utilize our stock repurchase programs to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program and on a more opportunistic basis if we believe our stock presents a compelling investment compared to other discretionary uses. The timing of any future repurchases and the actual amounts repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $\n5.8\n billion of capacity remaining under the 2024 program.\n17.\nIncome Per Share Information\nThe calculations of basic and diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders are as follows (dollars in millions, except share and per share data):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBasic Income Per Share\nNet income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders\n$\n968\n \n$\n986\n \n$\n1,407\n \nWeighted average shares outstanding for basic income per share\n305,859,458\n \n308,430,080\n \n322,813,345\n \nBasic income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders\n$\n3.16\n \n$\n3.20\n \n$\n4.36\n \nDiluted Income Per Share\nNet income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders\n$\n968\n \n$\n986\n \n$\n1,407\n \nWeighted average shares outstanding for basic income per share\n305,859,458\n \n308,430,080\n \n322,813,345\n \nDilutive effect of contingently issuable shares\n2,174,154\n \n4,120,862\n \n4,882,770\n \nWeighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per share\n308,033,612\n \n312,550,942\n \n327,696,115\n \nDiluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. stockholders\n$\n3.14\n \n$\n3.15\n \n$\n4.29\n \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, \n9,222\n, \n338,711\n and \n1,312,197\n, respectively, of contingently issuable shares were excluded from the computation of diluted income per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.\n106\n18.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nWe account for revenue\n \nwith customers in accordance with Topic 606.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized revenue of $\n214\n million that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2023.\nContract Costs\nWe capitalized $\n56\n million, $\n40\n million and $\n30\n million, respectively, of transition costs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. We recorded amortization of transition costs of $\n36\n million, $\n37\n million and $\n42\n million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n108\n19.\nSegments\nWe organize our operations around, and publicly report our financial results on, \nthree\n global business segments: (1) Advisory Services; (2) Global Workplace Solutions and (3) Real Estate Investments. In addition, we also have a “Corporate, other and eliminations” segment. Our Corporate segment primarily consists of corporate costs for leadership and certain other central functions. We track our strategic non-core equity investments in “other” which is considered an operating segment and reported together with Corporate as it does not meet the aggregation criteria for presentation as a separate reportable segment. These activities are not allocated to the other business segments. Corporate and other also includes eliminations related to inter-segment revenue. \nSegment operating profit (SOP) is the measure reported to Bob Sulentic, CBRE’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is our chief operating decision maker (CODM) for purposes of assessing performance and making decisions about allocating resources to each segment. The CODM uses SOP results compared to prior periods and previously forecasted amounts to assess performance and identify trends of ongoing operations within each segment. SOP excludes the impact of certain costs and charges that may obscure the underlying performance of our businesses and related trends, including restructuring charges and other costs incurred, which are outside the ordinary course of business. SOP represents earnings, inclusive of amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and asset impairments. In addition, management excludes the following costs from SOP (“Other segment adjustments”):\n•\ncosts associated with efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives,\n•\ncharges related to indirect tax audits and settlements,\n•\ncarried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue, \n•\nimpact of fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in the Telford acquisition (purchase accounting) that were sold in the period, \n•\ncosts incurred related to legal entity restructuring,\n•\nintegration and other costs related to acquisitions, \n•\nprovision associated with Telford’s fire safety remediation efforts, \n•\none-time gain associated with remeasuring an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary to fair value as of the date the remaining controlling interest was acquired; and,\n•\nthe impact of fair value non-cash adjustments related to unconsolidated equity investments.\nSOP for the three global business segments excludes the impact of corporate overhead as these costs are reported under Corporate and other. There have been no significant changes to the measurement methods of expenses or methods of allocating expenses to segments during 2024.\n109\nSummarized financial information by segment is as follows (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nAdvisory\n Services\nGlobal\nWorkplace\nSolutions\nReal Estate\nInvestments\nCorporate,\nother and eliminations \n(2)\nConsolidated\nNet revenue\n$\n9,507\n \n$\n10,340\n \n$\n1,038\n \n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n20,868\n \nPass-through costs also recognized as revenue\n99\n \n14,800\n \n—\n \n—\n \n14,899\n \nTotal revenue\n9,606\n \n25,140\n \n1,038\n \n(\n17\n)\n35,767\n \nCost of revenue\n5,858\n \n22,703\n \n224\n \n26\n \n28,811\n \nOperating expenses and allocations\n2,099\n \n1,327\n \n862\n \n723\n \n5,011\n \nOther adjustments to segment operating profit (loss):\nEquity income (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries\n1\n \n(\n3\n)\n117\n \n(\n134\n)\n(\n19\n)\nOther income\n5\n \n3\n \n6\n \n25\n \n39\n \nGain on disposition of real estate\n—\n \n—\n \n142\n \n—\n \n142\n \nOther segment adjustments \n(1)\n40\n \n91\n \n44\n \n305\n \n480\n \nSegment operating profit (loss)\n$\n1,695\n \n$\n1,201\n \n$\n261\n \n$\n(\n570\n)\n$\n2,587\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nAdvisory\n Services\nGlobal\nWorkplace\nSolutions\nReal Estate\nInvestments\nCorporate,\nother and eliminations\nConsolidated\nNet revenue\n$\n8,411\n \n$\n8,930\n \n$\n952\n \n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n18,276\n \nPass-through costs also recognized as revenue\n88\n \n13,585\n \n—\n \n—\n \n13,673\n \nTotal revenue\n8,499\n \n22,515\n \n952\n \n(\n17\n)\n31,949\n \nCost of revenue\n5,147\n \n20,345\n \n186\n \n(\n3\n)\n25,675\n \nOperating expenses and allocations\n2,076\n \n1,242\n \n784\n \n460\n \n4,562\n \nOther adjustments to segment operating profit (loss):\nEquity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries\n4\n \n1\n \n216\n \n27\n \n248\n \nOther income\n46\n \n2\n \n—\n \n13\n \n61\n \nGain on disposition of real estate\n—\n \n—\n \n27\n \n—\n \n27\n \nOther segment adjustments\n38\n \n75\n \n14\n \n66\n \n193\n \nSegment operating profit (loss)\n$\n1,364\n \n$\n1,006\n \n$\n239\n \n$\n(\n368\n)\n$\n2,241\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nAdvisory\n Services\nGlobal\nWorkplace\nSolutions\nReal Estate\nInvestments\nCorporate,\nother and eliminations\nConsolidated\nNet revenue\n$\n9,811\n \n$\n7,872\n \n$\n1,110\n \n$\n(\n16\n)\n$\n18,777\n \nPass-through costs also recognized as revenue\n72\n \n11,979\n \n—\n \n—\n \n12,051\n \nTotal revenue\n9,883\n \n19,851\n \n1,110\n \n(\n16\n)\n30,828\n \nCost of revenue\n5,980\n \n17,948\n \n322\n \n(\n11\n)\n24,239\n \nOperating expenses and allocations\n2,055\n \n1,080\n \n1,082\n \n432\n \n4,649\n \nOther adjustments to segment operating profit (loss):\nEquity income (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries\n15\n \n1\n \n380\n \n(\n167\n)\n229\n \nOther income (loss)\n1\n \n7\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n19\n)\n(\n12\n)\nGain on disposition of real estate\n—\n \n—\n \n244\n \n—\n \n244\n \nOther segment adjustments\n46\n \n68\n \n189\n \n45\n \n348\n \nSegment operating profit (loss)\n$\n1,910\n \n$\n899\n \n$\n518\n \n$\n(\n578\n)\n$\n2,749\n \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nOther segment adjustments, as defined above.\n(2)\nEliminations represent revenue from transactions between operating segments.

This transaction closed in the beginning of January 2025.\nOn January 16, 2025, we acquired the remaining equity interest in Industrious National Management, LLC (Industrious), a leading provider of flexible workplace solutions. We previously invested in Industrious through an approximately \n40\n% equity interest and a $\n100\n million convertible note. In conjunction with the acquisition, we will create a new business segment called Building Operations & Experience (BOE). This new segment will consist of CBRE’s enterprise facilities management, local facilities management, property management and flexible workplace business lines, and will unify the company’s building operations, workplace experience and property management capabilities across all property sectors and building types.\nAs a result of the establishment of the new BOE and Project Management segments, we will reorganize our operations and report our financial results based on \nfour\n reportable segments – Advisory Services, Building Operations & Experience, Project Management and Real Estate Investments beginning in the first quarter of 2025.\n20.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe accompanying consolidated balance sheets include loans to related parties, primarily employees other than our executive officers, of $\n780\n million and $\n733\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of these loans represent sign-on and retention bonuses issued or assumed in connection with acquisitions and prepaid commissions as well as prepaid retention and recruitment awards issued to employees. These loans are at varying principal amounts, bear interest at rates up to \n5.3\n% per annum and mature on various dates through 2034.\nSee Note 10 – Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries for additional details on related party revenue and receivables disclosure for the REI segment.\n112\n21.\nRestructuring Activities\nThe company continued to execute various restructuring activities during 2024 to simplify management and workforce structure and improve efficiencies in its operations. \nThe following tables present the detail of expenses incurred by segment (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nAdvisory\nServices\nGlobal\nWorkplace\nSolutions\nReal Estate\nInvestments\nCorporate\nConsolidated\nEmployee separation benefits\n$\n40\n \n$\n65\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n71\n \n$\n179\n \nProfessional fees and other\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n80\n \n80\n \nTotal\n$\n40\n \n$\n65\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n151\n \n$\n259\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nAdvisory\nServices\nGlobal\nWorkplace\nSolutions\nReal Estate\nInvestments\nCorporate\nConsolidated\nEmployee separation benefits\n$\n26\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n82\n \nLease exit costs\n39\n \n1\n \n4\n \n1\n \n45\n \nProfessional fees and other\n7\n \n19\n \n4\n \n2\n \n32\n \nSubtotal\n72\n \n52\n \n21\n \n14\n \n159\n \nDepreciation expense\n6\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n9\n \nTotal\n$\n78\n \n$\n52\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n168\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nAdvisory\nServices\nGlobal\nWorkplace\nSolutions\nReal Estate\nInvestments\nCorporate\nConsolidated\nEmployee separation benefits\n$\n33\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n81\n \nLease exit costs\n10\n \n3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n13\n \nProfessional fees and other\n3\n \n5\n \n3\n \n13\n \n24\n \nSubtotal\n46\n \n28\n \n12\n \n32\n \n118\n \nDepreciation expense\n5\n \n3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n8\n \nTotal\n$\n51\n \n$\n31\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n126\n \nThe following table shows ending liability balances associated with major cash-based charges (dollars in millions): \nEmployee separation benefits\nProfessional fees and other\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n37\n \n$\n10\n \nExpense incurred\n82\n \n32\n \nPayments made\n(\n106\n)\n(\n42\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n13\n \n—\n \nExpense incurred\n179\n \n79\n \nPayments made\n(\n146\n)\n(\n79\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n46\n \n$\n—\n \nThese restructuring activities are largely complete as of the end of fiscal year 2024.\nEnding balance related to employee separation benefits is included in “Compensation and employee benefits payable” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The BSA introduced new laws related to building safety and the remediation of historic building safety defects, effectively requiring developers to remediate certain buildings with critical fire safety issues. The BSA also retrospectively amended the Defective Premises Act of 1972 (DPA) to allow claims to be made within a 30-year limitation period for dwellings completed before June 28, 2022. The U.K. government had previously established a Building Safety Fund (BSF) and an Aluminum Composite Material (ACM) fund, whereby applicants to the fund would be funded by the government to remediate certain fire safety defects if certain criteria were met. On March 16, 2023, Telford Homes entered into a legally binding agreement with the U.K. government, under which Telford Homes will (1) take responsibility for performing or funding remediation works relating to certain life-critical fire-safety issues on all Telford Homes-constructed buildings of 11 meters in height or greater in England constructed in the last 30 years (in-scope buildings) and (2) withdraw Telford Homes-developed buildings from the government-sponsored BSF and ACM Funds or reimburse the government funds for the cost of remediation of in-scope buildings.\nWe believe there is an obligation attributable to past events, including as a result of retrospective changes in building fire-safety regulations, under the Pledge and the legally binding agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2024, management substantially finalized the determination of in-scope buildings that require some level of remediation with assistance from internal and external experts. We believe approximately \n80\n buildings are in-scope as compared to \n79\n buildings deemed to be at risk at December 31, 2023.\nThe accompanying consolidated balance sheets include an estimated \nliability\n of approximately $\n204\n million (of which $\n102\n million was current) and $\n192\n million (of which $\n82\n million was current) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the remediation efforts. The \ncurrent liability\n includes estimates related to remediation activities we plan to perform within one year and the net amounts that the U.K. government has already paid or quantified through the BSF for remediation of Telford-constructed buildings. The remaining balance represents estimates developed by Telford’s internal team and/or third-party experts for the remaining in-scope buildings. The overall balance increased during 2024 based on additional information obtained and evaluations performed allowing for a more refined estimate on a building-by-building basis.\nThe estimated remediation costs for in-scope buildings are subjective, highly complex and dependent on a number of variables outside of Telford Homes’ control. These include, but are not limited to, individual remediation requirements for each building, the time required for the remediation to be completed, cost of construction or remediation materials, availability of construction materials, potential discoveries made during remediation that could necessitate incremental work, investigation costs, availability of qualified fire safety engineers, potential business disruption costs, potential changes to or new regulations and regulatory approval. We will continue to assess new information as it becomes available during the remediation process and adjust our estimated liability accordingly.\n23.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 1, 2025, we combined our project management business with our Turner & Townsend subsidiary and increased our ownership in the combined entity to \n70\n%. In addition, on January 16, 2025, we also acquired the remaining equity interest in Industrious, a provider of premium flexible workplace solutions. For additional information, see Note 19 – Segments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n114\nItem 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A.    Controls and Procedures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)). The company’s management, with participation of the CEO and CFO, under the oversight of our Board, evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; \n(2)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and \n(3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness towards future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nBased on the evaluation under this framework, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nOur evaluation of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal control over financial reporting of J&J Worldwide Services (J&J), which we acquired in the first quarter of 2024. The percentage of total assets and revenue attributable to the acquired J&J Worldwide Services (J&J) included in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 was approximately 4% and 1%, respectively.\nThe effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein on page \n55\n.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (certifying officers) have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our certifying officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2024.\nRule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act requires that we conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, and we have a disclosure policy in furtherance of the same. This evaluation is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects. The evaluation is further designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer supervise and participate in this evaluation, and they are assisted by members of our Disclosure Committee. Our Disclosure Committee consists of our Chief Legal & Administrative Officer, our Chief Accounting Officer, and other select employees.\n115\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs described above, in the first quarter of 2024, we acquired J&J. As part of our ongoing integration activities, we continue to implement our controls and procedures over J&J to reflect the risks inherent in our acquisition. Throughout the integration process, we monitor these efforts and take corrective action as needed to reinforce the application of our controls and procedures.
