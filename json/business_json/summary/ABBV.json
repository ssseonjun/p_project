Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) is approved in the United States and European Union for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (12 years and older or weighing at least 45 kilograms) with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection without cirrhosis .\n AbbVie has the rights to sell Creon only in the United States . Linzess (linaclotide) is a once-daily guanylate cyclase-C agonist used in adults to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS‑C) and chronic idiopathic constipation .\n AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers . No single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business . No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 39% of Abbvie's 2024 gross revenues in the United States .\n The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition . The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence . The substitution of generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection .\n Humira faces direct biosimilar competition globally . AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products . Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is \"highly similar\" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences .\n AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development . In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date . Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years .\n Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval . The scope, length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions . For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug .\n Applicable laws dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country . It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity . Given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods . Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above .\n AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications . The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilars . The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilar products and has published guidelines for approval .\n AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach of confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators . The company enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, licensing arrangements, option-to-acquire agreements and strategic alliances . The licensing and other arrangements typically include non-refundable upfront license fees, royalty and/or profit sharing obligations .\n AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products . The company maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations .\n The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease . If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases: Preclinical data and clinical trials provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA .\n The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years . Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product . The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices .\n Failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, including rejection of an NDA or BLA . The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements . As a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety after commercialization .\n AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets . The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for approval in the United States .\n The manufacturing, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation . Clinical data in Chinese subjects are usually required to support approval in China, requiring the inclusion of China in global pivotal studies, or a separate China/Asian clinical trial . Post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply .\n AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products . Prescription drug manufacturers are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees . Compliance with these regulations will continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance .\n AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components . Government agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries continue to be a subject of oversight . Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers .\n U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans . Efforts by states to seek additional rebates may affect AbbVie's business . Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program . Recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries .\n AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs . The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act . The law requires manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians . Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties .\n Imbruvica is one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026 . The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products . The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement could significantly impact revenues for certain of our products .\n In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent launch through direct price controls or reference pricing . European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers . In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement .\n New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, may be eligible for a pricing premium . Emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals . Medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and foreign government health authorities .\n Each medical device AbbVie markets in the United States must have a 510(k) clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with each device . Devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices .\n A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification . Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA . Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility inspections . The manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation .\n Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the FDA . Manufacturers must also report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury . Failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect AbbVie’s ability to market .\n AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection . Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund .\n AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees . The company invests in its employees through competitive compensation, benefits and employee support programs and offers best-in-class development and leadership opportunities . Outside the United States, some of Abbvie's employees are represented by unions or works councils .\n AbbVie has on-site health care clinics at certain locations, offering convenient and affordable access to quality healthcare, flu shots and vaccines . The company also provides structured, broad-based development opportunities, focusing on high-performance skills and leadership training .
