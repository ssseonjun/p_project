    "item1": "ITEM 1.    BUSINESS\nOverview\nAmerican Express is a globally integrated payments company with card-issuing, merchant-acquiring and card network businesses that offer products and services to a broad range of customers, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations around the world.\nOur range of products and services includes:\n•\nCredit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products\n•\nMerchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, fraud prevention, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services\n•\nNetwork services\n•\nTravel and lifestyle services\n•\nExpense management products and services\n•\nOther services, such as the design and operation of customer loyalty programs\nThese products and services are offered through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, in-house sales teams, direct mail, telephone and direct response advertising.\nWe were founded in 1850 as a joint stock association and were incorporated in 1965 as a New York corporation. American Express Company and its principal operating subsidiary, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), are bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act), subject to supervision and examination by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). \nWe principally engage in businesses comprising four reportable operating segments: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), Commercial Services (CS), International Card Services (ICS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate & Other. Our businesses function together to form our end-to-end integrated payments platform, which we believe is a differentiator that underpins our business model. For further information about our reportable operating segments, see “Business Segment Results of Operations” under “MD&A.”\n1\nTable of Contents\nOur Integrated Payments Platform and Technology\nThrough our card-issuing, merchant-acquiring and card network businesses, we are able to connect participants and provide differentiated value across the commerce path. We maintain direct relationships with Card Members (as a card issuer) and merchants (as an acquirer), which provides us with access to information at both ends of the card transaction, distinguishing our integrated payments platform from the bankcard networks. Through contractual relationships, we also obtain information from third-party card issuers, merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors with whom we do business.\nOur integrated payments platform and the systems and infrastructure that underlie it provide us with data and analytics, while maintaining our commitment to respect Card Member preferences and protect Card Member and merchant data in compliance with applicable policies and legal requirements. Our models and analytical tools help us reduce fraud and underwrite risk, such as in determinations regarding the extension of credit. We also leverage our technology to provide differentiated value to customers, such as special offers and benefits to Card Members and targeted marketing and other information services for merchants and partners, as well as to develop and improve our service capabilities to continue to deliver a high-quality customer experience.\nCard Issuing Businesses\nWe are a leader in providing general purpose credit and charge cards to consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. We offer a broad set of card products, rewards and services to this premium consumer and broad commercial customer base, in the United States and internationally, through our USCS, CS and ICS reportable operating segments. We focus on differentiating American Express Membership through premium products, lifestyle services for consumers and business-centric solutions for our commercial customers, and benefits for our Card Members that we co-create and co-fund with our business partners. We believe the many benefits that come with American Express Membership build a strong, emotional connection with our brand across generations and geographies.\nWe acquire and retain high-spending, engaged and creditworthy Card Members by:\n•\nDesigning innovative credit, charge and debit card products and payment and lending solutions that appeal to our target customer base and meet their spending and borrowing needs\n•\nUsing incentives to drive spending on our various card products and increase customer engagement, including our Membership Rewards\n®\n and Amex Offers\n™\n programs, cash-back reward features, statement credits for purchases with partners, interest rates offered on deposits and participation in loyalty programs sponsored by our cobrand and other partners\n•\nProviding digital and mobile services and an array of benefits and experiences across card products, such as lounge access, dining experiences and other travel and lifestyle benefits\n•\nCreating world-class service experiences by delivering exceptional customer care\n•\nDeveloping a wide range of partner relationships, including designing, cobranding and distributing certain of our cards and providing benefits and services to our Card Members\nWe have a number of products that complement our card products, such as our business checking and consumer rewards checking account products, expense management and business-to-business (B2B) payment products and other non-card payment and financing products. Our complementary products also include digital capabilities, such as our Business Blueprint digital cash flow management hub and our Resy\n®\n dining platform, which we are enhancing through our acquisitions in 2024 of Tock, a reservation, table and event management technology provider and Rooam, a technology company that powers systems used by restaurants and entertainment venues.\nWe are focused on enhancing the value propositions of our products to increase engagement with existing customers and attract new customers, including Millennial and Gen Z consumers as well as customers internationally. Jurisdictions that represent a significant portion of our billed business outside of the United States include the United Kingdom (UK), the European Union (EU), Australia, Japan, Canada and Mexico.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, worldwide billed business (spending on American Express cards issued by us) was $1,551 billion and as of December 31, 2024, we had 83.6 million proprietary cards-in-force worldwide.\n2\nTable of Contents\nMerchant Acquiring Business\nOur GMNS reportable operating segment builds and manages relationships with millions of merchants around the world that choose to accept American Express cards. This includes signing new merchants to accept our cards, agreeing on the discount rate (a fee charged to the merchant for accepting our cards) and handling servicing for merchants. We also build and maintain relationships with merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage aspects of our merchant services business. For example, through our OptBlue\n®\n merchant-acquiring program, third-party processors contract directly with small merchants for card acceptance on our network and determine merchant pricing. We continue to grow merchant acceptance of American Express cards around the world and work with merchant partners so that our Card Members are warmly welcomed and encouraged to spend in the millions of places where their American Express cards are accepted. We also seek to drive greater usage of the American Express network by deepening merchant engagement and increasing Card Member awareness through initiatives such as our Shop Small\n®\n campaigns and expanding our payment options such as through debit and B2B capabilities.\nGMNS also provides fraud-prevention tools, marketing solutions, data analytics and other programs and services to merchants and other partners that leverage the capabilities of our integrated payments platform.\nCard Network Business\nWe operate a payments network through which we establish and maintain relationships with third-party banks and other institutions in approximately 120 countries and territories, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of our global network. These network partners are licensed to issue local currency American Express-branded cards in their countries and/or serve as the merchant acquirer for local merchants on our network.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, worldwide network services processed volume (spending on American Express cards issued by third parties) was $213.9 billion and as of December 31, 2024, we had 62.8 million cards-in-force issued by third parties worldwide.\nDiverse Customer Base and Global Footprint\nThe following chart provides a summary of our diverse set of customers and broad geographic footprint based on worldwide network volumes:\n3\nTable of Contents\nPartners and Relationships\nOur integrated payments platform allows us to work with a range of business partners, and our partners in return help drive the scale and relevance of the platform.\nThere are many examples of how we work with partners, including: issuing cards under cobrand arrangements with other corporations and institutions (e.g., Delta Air Lines (Delta), Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Marriott International and British Airways); providing greater value to our Card Members (e.g., Amex Offers and statement credits for purchases with partners); offering innovative ways for our Card Members to earn and use points with our merchants (e.g., Pay with Points at Amazon.com); expanding merchant acceptance with third-party acquirers and processors (e.g., OptBlue partners); operating through joint ventures in certain jurisdictions (e.g., in China, the Middle East and Switzerland); developing new capabilities and features with our digital partners (e.g., PayPal and i2c); enhancing our travel benefits and services (e.g., Fine Hotels and Resorts\n®\n); and providing experiences and entertainment for Card Members (e.g., via Formula 1 and AEG Worldwide). We also have an ownership position in, and commercial arrangements with, Global Business Travel Group, Inc. (GBTG), which provides business travel-related services.\nDelta is our largest strategic partner. Our relationships with, and revenues and expenses related to, Delta are significant and represent an important source of value for our Card Members. We issue cards under cobrand arrangements with Delta and the Delta cobrand portfolio continued to represent approximately 12 percent of worldwide billed business and approximately 21 percent of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2024. The Delta cobrand portfolio generates fee revenue and interest income from Card Members and discount revenue from Delta and other merchants for spending on Delta cobrand cards. The current Delta cobrand agreement runs through the end of 2029 and we expect to continue to make significant investments in this partnership. Among other things, Delta is also a key participant in our Membership Rewards program, provides travel-related benefits and services, including airport lounge access for certain American Express Card Members, accepts American Express cards as a merchant and is a corporate payments customer.\nWorking with all of our partners, we seek to provide value, choice and unique experiences across our customer base.\nOur Spend-Centric Model and Revenue Mix\nOur “spend-centric” business model focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our cards and secondarily through finance charges and fees. Spending on our cards, which is higher on average on a per-card basis versus our network competitors, offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions, and attracts partners to provide value to our Card Members and merchants. Because of the revenues generated from having high-spending Card Members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products, we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members, as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants. This creates incentives for Card Members to spend more on their cards and positively differentiates American Express cards.\nWe believe our spend-centric model gives us the ability to provide differentiated value to Card Members, merchants and business partners.\nThe American Express Brand and Service Excellence\nOur brand and its attributes—trust, security and service—are key assets. We invest heavily in managing, marketing, promoting and protecting our brand, including through the delivery of our products and services in a manner consistent with our brand promise. The American Express brand is ranked among the most valuable brands in the world. We place significant importance on trademarks, service marks and patents, and seek to secure our intellectual property rights around the world.\nWe aim to provide the world’s best customer experience every day and our reputation for world-class service has been recognized by numerous awards over the years. Our customer care professionals, travel consultants and partners treat servicing interactions as an opportunity to bring the brand to life for our customers, add meaningful value and deepen relationships.\n4\nTable of Contents\nOur Business Strategies\nWe seek to grow our business by focusing on four strategic imperatives:\nFirst, we aim to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing to deliver membership benefits that span our customers’ everyday spending, borrowing, travel and lifestyle needs, expanding our roster of business partners around the globe and developing a range of experiences that attract high-spending customers.\nSecond, we seek to build on our strong position in commercial payments by evolving our card value propositions, further differentiating our corporate card and accounts payable expense management solutions and designing innovative products and features, including financing, banking and payment solutions for our business customers.\nThird, we are focused on strengthening our global, integrated network by continuing to increase merchant acceptance, providing merchants with fraud protection services, marketing insights and connections to higher-spending Card Members and working with our network partners to offer expanded products and services.\nFinally, we want to continue to build on our unique global position, seeking ways to use our differentiated business model and global presence as we progress against our other strategic imperatives.\nWe have completed the environmental, social and governance goals under our 2021–2024 strategy, other than our continued work in support of Small Business Saturday and other Shop Small campaigns that will progress in 2025 and beyond. We are reviewing our approach on these topics as mandatory reporting requirements evolve globally.\n5\nTable of Contents\nOur Colleagues\nOur colleagues are integral to executing our business strategies and to our overall success. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 75,100 people, whom we refer to as colleagues, with approximately 25,800 colleagues in the United States and approximately 49,300 colleagues outside the United States. As of December 31, 2024, women represented 52.6 percent of our global workforce; Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino/a people represented 22.4 percent, 14.2 percent and 14.5 percent, respectively, of our U.S. workforce based on preliminary data for our 2024 U.S. EEO-1 submission; and 55 percent of our Executive Committee were women or from diverse races and ethnic backgrounds.\nWe believe that maintaining our strong workplace culture, adhering to our Blue Box values and ensuring that our people feel included, valued, recognized and backed helps us attract, retain and develop the right talent for American Express’ success. We conduct an annual Colleague Experience Survey and in 2024, 90 percent of colleagues who participated in the survey said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work.\nWe strive to offer a compelling colleague value proposition, which represents the many ways in which we support our colleagues to be and deliver their best. In 2024, we continued to invest in our colleagues, building on a wide range of learning and development opportunities and enhancing our competitive benefits in key areas including total compensation and holistic health and wellness.\nWe continuously invest in programs, benefits and resources to foster the personal and professional growth of our colleagues. We start with opportunities for colleagues to learn on the job, build cross-functional skills and grow in their careers through a defined, collaborative process for performance management. Colleagues have access to a wide variety of resources: career coaching, mentoring, professional networking, and rotation opportunities, as well as courses on-demand and with classroom-style instruction. \nWe aim to provide our colleagues with competitive compensation and leading benefits and take a holistic approach to well-being, providing resources that address the physical, financial and mental health of our colleagues. Our financial well-being program, Smart Saving, provides tools and resources to help colleagues build their knowledge and skills for all life stages. We support our colleagues’ physical health and well-being through our corporate wellness program, Healthy Living and we provide resources and support to increase awareness about mental health among our colleagues through our Healthy Minds Program. We also have policies and processes in place to help ensure we compensate colleagues fairly and equitably. We review our compensation practices regularly and have conducted an annual pay equity review since 2017, assessing pay on a statistical basis and considering key factors known to affect compensation, such as role, level, tenure, performance and geography. In 2024, we maintained 100 percent pay equity, meaning no statistical differences in pay, for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the United States.\n6\nTable of Contents\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nSet forth below, in alphabetical order, is a list of our executive officers as of February 7, 2025, including each executive officer’s principal occupation and employment during the past five years.

The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies, consumer habits and merchant needs.\nAs a card issuer, we compete with financial institutions that issue general-purpose credit and debit cards, as well as businesses that issue private label cards, operate mobile wallets, provide payment services or extend credit. We face intense competition in the premium space and for cobrand relationships, as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted high-spending customers and key business partners with attractive value propositions. We also face competition for partners and other differentiated offerings, such as lounge space in U.S. and global hub airports, dining and event reservation and operational capabilities and other experiential offerings to customers. Our banking products also face strong competition, such as with respect to the rates offered on deposits.\nOur global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, Visa, China UnionPay, Mastercard, JCB, Discover and Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network globally based on purchase volume, behind Visa, China UnionPay and Mastercard. In addition to such networks, we compete against a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers, processors and web- and mobile-based payment platforms (e.g., Alipay, PayPal and Shop Pay), as well as regional payment networks (such as the National Payments Corporation of India).\nThe principal competitive factors that affect card-issuing, merchant and network businesses include:\n•\nThe features, value and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs and offers, partnerships, travel and lifestyle-related benefits (including lounges, dining and other entertainment), banking services and digital and mobile services, as well as the costs associated with providing such features and services\n•\nReputation and brand recognition\n•\nThe number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers\n•\nThe quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used\n•\nThe attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers, merchant acquirers, third-party processors, cardholders, corporate clients, merchants and other payment intermediaries (including the relative cost and ease of using or accepting the products and services, and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics)\n•\nThe number, quality and cost of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers, as well as the integration and connectivity of those products\n•\nThe security of cardholder, merchant and network partner information\n•\nThe success of marketing and promotional campaigns\n•\nThe speed of innovation and investment in systems, technologies and product and service offerings\n•\nThe nature and quality of expense management tools, electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities, particularly for business customers\nAnother aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products, which include payment facilitators and aggregators, digital payment, open banking and electronic wallet platforms, point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products, real-time settlement and processing systems, financial technology companies, digital currencies developed by both central banks and the private sector, blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies, prepaid systems and gift cards, and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions. The integration of new or evolving technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence, has the potential to create new or better competitor products, alter the competitive environment and disintermediate our relationship with customers. Additionally, various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of an integrated payments platform, such as ours.\n9\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the discussion in this section, see “\nOur operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry\n” under “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business, and “\nOur business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\n” and “\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand\n” under “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively due to government regulations or if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products.\n10\nTable of Contents\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nOverview\nWe are subject to evolving and extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, and the costs of ongoing compliance are substantial. The financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny, high regulatory expectations, a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment.\nGovernmental authorities have focused, and we believe will continue to focus, considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms and payment systems with laws and regulations, and as a result, we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework, governance structures, practices and procedures. Reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations, as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies, including errors or misconduct by colleagues or third parties or control failures, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our products, practices and procedures, restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. We have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations, enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. For example, as previously disclosed, we entered into agreements to resolve governmental investigations related to historical sales practices for certain U.S. small business customers, which are described in more detail in Note 12 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” In addition, various regulatory agencies have announced they are reviewing credit card rewards programs for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. We have identified certain issues related to the rewards and benefits we provide including, as previously disclosed, that certain U.S. Card Members were not credited certain Membership Rewards points they had earned. We have taken actions to remediate these issues and enhance our related procedures and controls. We are cooperating with ongoing regulatory inquiries concerning our rewards and benefits programs.\nPolicymakers around the world continue to propose and adopt new and increasingly complex laws and regulations governing a wide variety of issues that may impact our business or change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. For example, legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the offering of consumer financial products and the operation of payment networks, resulting in changes to certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, the establishment of broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes.\nThe following discussion summarizes elements of the extensive regulatory environment in which we operate; it does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws or regulations to which we are subject or all possible or proposed changes in laws or regulations that may become applicable to us. See “Operational and Compliance/Legal Risks” under “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the potential impact that changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities, may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBanking Regulation\nAmerican Express entities are subject to banking regulation in the United States and in certain jurisdictions internationally. U.S. federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies extensively regulate the Company, TRS and our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB). For purposes of this Supervision and Regulation section, the “Company” refers only to American Express Company, a bank holding company, and does not include its subsidiaries. Both the Company and TRS are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve and AENB is supervised, regulated and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the rulemaking, enforcement and examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Banking regulators have broad examination and enforcement powers, including the power to impose substantial fines, limit dividends and other capital distributions, restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures, any of which could compromise our competitive position. Many aspects of our business also are subject to rigorous regulation by other U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and by non-U.S. government agencies and regulatory bodies. For example, non-U.S. regulators supervising our international regulated financial institutions use many of the same principles of regulation and supervision that are used by U.S. federal bank regulators.\n11\nTable of Contents\nActivities\nThe BHC Act generally limits bank holding companies to activities that are considered to be banking activities and certain closely related activities. As noted above, each of the Company and TRS is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company, which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities. In order to remain eligible for financial holding company status, the Company and TRS must meet certain eligibility requirements. Those requirements include that each of the Company and AENB must be “well capitalized” and “well managed,” and AENB must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating on its most recent assessment under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA). The Company, TRS and their subsidiaries engage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies, including, in particular, providing travel agency services, acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services. If the Company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status, it and its subsidiaries are likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company, and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies or divest AENB. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that regulatory authorities deem unsafe or unsound (which such authorities generally interpret broadly) and regulatory authorities have discretion in determining whether new or modified activities can be conducted in a safe and sound manner.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nApplicable federal and state laws place limitations on the ability of persons to invest in or acquire control of us without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulators. In addition, we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions and, in some cases, subject them to the prior review and approval of our regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Federal banking regulators have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisitions and investments that are subject to their prior review or approval.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards\nThe Company is subject to the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’ rules that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. Under these rules, each such bank holding company is assigned to one of four categories based on its status as a U.S. global systemically important banking organization and five other risk-based indicators: (i) total assets, (ii) cross-jurisdictional activity, (iii) non-bank assets, (iv) off-balance sheet exposure, and (v) weighted short-term wholesale funding, with the most stringent requirements applying to Category I firms and the least stringent requirements applying to Category IV firms. Under these rules, the Company became a Category III firm in the third quarter of 2024 as a result of the Company’s total consolidated assets exceeding $250 billion, calculated based on a daily average of total consolidated assets for the four quarters ended June 30, 2024. Category III firms are subject to heightened capital, liquidity and prudential requirements, single-counterparty credit limits and additional stress tests, which in some cases are subject to a transition period. AENB, as a depository institution subsidiary of a Category III firm, is also subject to certain enhanced prudential standards under these tailoring rules as described below.\nFurther changes in the levels of risk-based indicators described above, such as if we have $75 billion or more in cross-jurisdictional activity (based on a four-quarter trailing average), could result in the Company becoming a Category II firm and subject to more stringent capital, liquidity and prudential requirements. Our cross-jurisdictional activity was $66 billion as of December 31, 2024, and the four-quarter trailing average was $67 billion.\nCapital and Liquidity Regulation\nCapital Rules\nThe Company and AENB are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rules established by federal banking regulators. These rules are intended to ensure that bank holding companies and depository institutions (collectively, banking organizations) have adequate capital given their level of assets and off-balance sheet obligations. The federal banking regulators’ current capital rules (the Capital Rules) implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s framework for strengthening international capital regulation, known as Basel III. For additional information regarding our capital ratios, see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” under “MD&A.”\n12\nTable of Contents\nUnder the Capital Rules, banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1 capital), Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets. We report our capital adequacy ratios using risk-weighted assets calculated under the standardized approach. Category III firms such as the Company are not subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements, whereas Category II firms are subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements under current capital rules, which introduce additional complexities in the methodologies used to calculate risk-weighted assets for purposes of determining capital adequacy ratios.\nOn July 27, 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would significantly revise U.S. regulatory capital requirements for large banking organizations, including the Company and AENB. The proposed rules would apply a new expanded risk-based approach to calculating risk-based capital ratios, and large banking organizations would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under both (i) the standardized approach and (ii) the expanded risk-based approach and use the lower of the two ratio calculations to determine binding capital constraints under each risk-based capital ratio. The expanded risk-based approach to calculating risk-weighted assets would apply more granular risk-weighting methodologies for credit risk, include a new standardized methodology for operational risk, include new approaches for calculating market and credit valuation adjustment risk and revise the treatment of equity exposures not subject to market risk capital requirements. The new approach to calculating market risk also would apply to calculations under the standardized approach. The methodology for operational risk would include differential treatment of fee and other non-interest revenues as compared to interest income for purposes of determining operational risk-weighted assets. The proposed rules would also include additional credit risk capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments” such as unused portions of committed lines of credit (e.g., credit cards) and would create a proxy methodology to assign capital requirements to credit exposure on products that carry no pre-set spending limits such as charge cards. The Federal Reserve has issued public statements indicating that it intends to work with other U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies on a revised proposal; however, any future rulemaking with respect to Basel III standards remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of any such rulemaking will depend on a number of factors, including the content of the final rulemaking, future minimum regulatory requirements and management decisions regarding our product constructs, capital distributions and target capital levels, and such rulemaking could result in significantly higher regulatory capital requirements for the Company and AENB.\nThe Company and AENB must each maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of at least 4.5 percent, 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively. On top of these minimum capital ratios, the Company is subject to a dynamic stress capital buffer (SCB) composed entirely of CET1 capital with a floor of 2.5 percent and AENB is subject to a static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer (CCB). The SCB equals (i) the difference between a bank holding company’s starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario under the Federal Reserve’s stress tests described below, plus (ii) one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. As a Category III firm, the required minimum capital ratios for the Company may be further increased by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, if enacted by the Federal Reserve, which must be held in the form of CET1 capital. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero percent; however it could change in the future. If the Federal Reserve were to raise the countercyclical capital buffer, covered banking organizations such as the Company would generally have 12 months after the announcement of such increase to meet the increased buffer requirement, unless the Federal Reserve sets an earlier effective date.\nOn August 28, 2024, the Federal Reserve confirmed the SCB for the Company of 2.5 percent, which remained unchanged from the level announced in July 2023. As a result, the effective minimum ratios for the Company (taking into account the SCB requirement) and AENB (taking into account the CCB requirement) are 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent for the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, respectively. Banking organizations with ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital or Total capital to risk-weighted assets below these effective minimum ratios face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends, repurchases and redemptions of capital securities and executive compensation. A bank holding company’s SCB requirement is effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect through September 30 of the following year unless it is reset in connection with resubmission of a capital plan, as discussed below.\nThe Company is also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization’s Tier 1 capital to its average total consolidated assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). The Company is also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio, which is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to an expanded concept of leverage exposure that takes into account both on‐balance sheet assets and certain off‐balance sheet exposures. All banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent, and Category III banking organizations such as the Company are required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0 percent.\n13\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Regulation \nThe Company and AENB are subject to two standards for liquidity risk supervision as implemented by the Federal Reserve and OCC: the minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets to meet its liquidity needs for a 30-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario specified by supervisors. The LCR measures the ratio of a firm’s high-quality liquid assets to its projected net outflows. The NSFR requires a minimum amount of longer-term funding sources based on the assets, commitments and derivative exposures of banking entities. As a Category III firm with less than $75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, the Company, and its depository institution subsidiary, AENB, are subject to LCR and NSFR requirements at 85 percent of the full requirements. The Company and AENB are required to calculate the LCR and NSFR on a daily basis and the Company is required to make public disclosures related to its LCR on a quarterly basis and NSFR on a semi-annual basis, in each case, subject to applicable transition periods following the Company becoming a Category III firm. Category II firms and their depository institution subsidiaries are subject to the full requirements of the LCR and NSFR, as well as a requirement to submit a liquidity monitoring report on a daily (rather than monthly) basis.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standards rule includes heightened liquidity and risk management requirements. The rule requires the maintenance of a liquidity buffer, consisting of highly liquid assets, that is sufficient to meet projected net outflows for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios. In contrast to the LCR, which is a standardized approach, the liquidity buffer requirement is calculated based on the Company’s own models.\nProposed Long-Term Debt Requirements\nOn August 29, 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that, if adopted as proposed, would require covered bank holding companies such as the Company to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible external long-term debt with specific terms for purposes of absorbing losses or recapitalizing the covered bank holding company and its operating subsidiaries. The notice of proposed rulemaking also proposed requiring certain insured depository institutions that have at least $100 billion in consolidated assets, such as AENB, to maintain minimum amounts of eligible internal long-term debt for purposes of absorbing losses or recapitalizing the insured depository institution.\nStress Testing and Capital Planning\nUnder the Federal Reserve’s regulations, the Company is subject to annual supervisory stress testing requirements and biennial company-run stress testing requirements (commonly referred to as Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests or “DFASTs”) that are designed to evaluate whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to absorb losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions.\nAs part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve uses pro-forma capital positions and ratios under such stress scenarios to determine the size of the SCB for each CCAR participating firm. As a Category III firm, the Company is required to develop and submit to the Federal Reserve an annual capital plan and stress testing results on or before April 5 of each year. \nThe Company may be required to revise and resubmit its capital plan following certain events or developments, such as a significant acquisition or an event that could result in a material change in its risk profile or financial condition. If the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan, it must receive prior approval from the Federal Reserve for any capital distributions (including common stock dividend payments and share repurchases), other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument.\n14\nTable of Contents\nDividends and Other Capital Distributions\nThe Company and TRS, as well as AENB and the Company’s insurance and other regulated subsidiaries, are limited in their ability to pay dividends by statutes, regulations and supervisory policy.\nCommon stock dividend payments and share repurchases by the Company are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve and the outcome of the annual CCAR stress testing exercise, as described above. The Company will be subject to limitations and restrictions on capital distributions if, among other things, (i) the Company’s regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan.\nIn general, federal laws and regulations prohibit, without first obtaining the OCC’s approval, AENB from making dividend distributions to TRS, if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause AENB to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. In addition to specific limitations on the dividends AENB can pay to TRS, federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution.\nPrompt Corrective Action\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) requires, among other things, that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the FDIC (such as AENB) that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified. In order to be considered “well capitalized,” AENB must maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively.\nUnder the FDIA, AENB could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits (i.e., deposits raised through third-party brokerage networks) or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A portion of our outstanding U.S. retail deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes. If a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits.\nResolution and Recovery Planning\nCertain bank holding companies are required to submit resolution plans to the Federal Reserve and FDIC providing for the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure. As a Category III firm, the Company is required to submit a holding company resolution plan every three years, with submissions alternating between a full plan and a plan targeted on certain areas or subjects identified by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.\n \nThe Company’s next holding company resolution plan is required to be submitted by October 1, 2025. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that the Company’s plan is not credible and we fail to cure the deficiencies, we may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements; may be subject to more restrictions on our growth, activities or operations; or may ultimately be required to divest certain assets or operations to facilitate an orderly resolution.\nAENB continues to be required to prepare and provide a separate resolution plan to the FDIC that would enable the FDIC, as receiver, to effectively resolve AENB under the FDIA in the event of failure. In June 2024, the FDIC issued a final rule revising its resolution plan requirements for insured depository institutions, which requires certain insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in assets, including AENB, to submit full resolution plans every three years with interim supplements in non-submission years. Under the final rule, resolution plans are subject to more stringent standards with respect to their assumptions and content, as well as enhanced credibility standards for the FDIC’s evaluation of resolution plans and expanded expectations regarding engagement and capabilities testing. AENB will be required to submit its initial resolution plan under the final rule on or before July 1, 2026, with its initial interim supplement due on or before July 1, 2025.\nIn October 2024, the OCC issued final revisions to its recovery planning guidelines, which expand the recovery planning guidelines to apply to insured national banks with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including AENB. The OCC’s recovery planning guidelines require a covered bank to develop, maintain and test a recovery plan that, among other things, identifies a range of options that could be undertaken by the covered bank to restore its financial strength and viability when it experiences considerable financial or operational stress, but has not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent. AENB will be required to develop a recovery plan by December 31, 2025 and test it by December 31, 2026, with testing then required periodically (but not less than annually) and following any significant changes to the recovery plan made in response to a material event.\n15\nTable of Contents\nOrderly Liquidation Authority\nThe Company could become subject to the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), a resolution regime under which the Treasury Secretary may appoint the FDIC as receiver to liquidate a systemically important financial institution, if the Company is in danger of default and is determined to present a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. As under the FDIC resolution model, under the OLA, the FDIC has broad power as receiver. Substantial differences exist, however, between the OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under the OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in limited circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditor claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure used in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a “bridge” entity.\nThe FDIC has developed a strategy under OLA, referred to as the “single point of entry” or “SPOE” strategy, under which the FDIC would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets (including shares of its operating subsidiaries) and, potentially, very limited liabilities to a “bridge” holding company; utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries; and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company. Under this strategy, management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and its shareholders and creditors would bear the losses resulting from the failure.\nFDIC Powers upon Insolvency of AENB\nIf the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of AENB, the FDIC has the power to: (1) transfer any of AENB’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of AENB’s creditors; (2) enforce the terms of AENB’s contracts pursuant to their terms; or (3) repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which AENB is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of AENB. In addition, the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC against AENB would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against AENB, including claims of debt holders and depositors in non-U.S. offices, in the liquidation or other resolution of AENB. As a result, regardless of whether the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of AENB, the debt holders and depositors in non-U.S. offices would be treated differently from, and could receive substantially less, if anything, than the depositors in the U.S. offices of AENB.\nOther Banking Regulations\nSource of Strength\nThe Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, and may be required to commit capital and financial resources to support AENB. Such support may be required at times when, absent this requirement, the Company otherwise might determine not to provide it. Capital loans by the Company to AENB are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of AENB. In the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of AENB will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\nTransactions Between AENB and its Affiliates\nCertain transactions (including loans and credit extensions from AENB) between AENB and its affiliates (including the Company, TRS and their other subsidiaries) are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations, collateral requirements and other restrictions imposed by statute and regulation. Transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an arm’s-length basis.\nFDIC Deposit Insurance and Insurance Assessments\nAENB accepts deposits that are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution’s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices; is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations; or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that would lead to termination of deposit insurance at AENB. The FDIC’s deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, including AENB, which are subject to adjustment by the FDIC. \n16\nTable of Contents\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nAENB is subject to the CRA, which imposes affirmative, ongoing obligations on depository institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. AENB is currently designated a “limited purpose bank” under CRA regulations. In October 2023\n, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a final rule that makes extensive revisions to the CRA regulatory framework, including to the definition of “limited purpose bank,” which could impact AENB and alter its CRA compliance obligations. In March 2024, a preliminary injunction was granted postponing the effectiveness of the final rule and the implementation dates until the resolution of litigation challenging the final rule; whether the final rule will ultimately be implemented and any related compliance deadlines remain uncertain.\nClimate Risk Management\nIn October 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions.” The principles apply to financial institutions with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, like the Company and AENB, and are broadly designed to provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks consistent with existing U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’ rules and guidance. The principles outline six key aspects of climate-related financial risk management: governance; policies, procedures and limits; strategic planning; risk management; data, risk measurement and reporting; and scenario analysis. In addition, the principles offer risk assessment guidance for incorporating climate-related financial risks in various traditional risk categories.\nConsumer Financial Products Regulation\nOur consumer-oriented activities are subject to regulation and supervision in the United States and internationally. In the United States, our marketing, sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products, and authority to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices. The CFPB has the authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, to enforce those laws and to examine for compliance. It is also authorized to collect fines and require consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, a number of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which, along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nThe CFPB and other regulators have recently had a heightened focus on fees, rewards and other practices related to credit cards. For example, in March 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule lowering the safe harbor amount for credit card late fees that would be considered “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by credit card issuers for late payments to eight dollars, eliminating a higher late fee safe harbor amount for subsequent late payments and eliminating the annual inflation adjustment for the safe harbor amount. In May 2024, a preliminary injunction was granted staying the effectiveness of the final rule; however, whether the final rule will ultimately be implemented remains uncertain. In addition, the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) have launched inquiries focused on credit card and airline rewards programs, with the CFPB issuing a circular to other agencies in December 2024 addressing the design, marketing and administration of credit card rewards programs.\nIn March 2023, the CFPB adopted a final rule requiring covered financial institutions, such as us, to collect and report data to the CFPB regarding certain small business credit applications. Based on our small business credit transaction volume, we will be required to comply with this rule by July 18, 2025 and begin reporting data to the CFPB by July 1, 2026.\nIn October 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule on personal financial data rights that requires financial institutions, including us, and other financial service providers (collectively referred to as data providers) to provide consumers and consumer-authorized third parties with access to consumers’ financial data in electronic form free of charge. At the earliest, for certain products, we will be required to comply with the rule beginning on April 1, 2026; however, the compliance timeline is subject to change due to the outcome of pending litigation challenging the rule. While the impact of the rule will depend upon a number of factors, including consumer behavior and the actions of data providers and recipients, open banking initiatives like this final rule have the potential to change the competitive landscape, presenting challenges to our business model, such as limiting advantages provided by our integrated payments platform, as well as opportunities since we may also act as an authorized third party and receive data from data providers.\n17\nTable of Contents\nWe are also regulated in the United States under the “money transmitter” or “sale of check” laws in effect in most states. In addition, we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws, under which we must pay to states the face amount of any Travelers Cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product. Additionally, we are regulated under insurance laws in the United States and other countries where we offer insurance services. Our merchant acquiring business, and the third-party merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors with whom we have relationships, are also subject to certain aspects of regulation under consumer protection laws, such as by the Federal Trade Commission.\nIn countries outside the United States, regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our card-issuing businesses, particularly consumer protection (such as in the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom and Canada) and responsible lending (such as in Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore), with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations. For example, the Financial Conduct Authority’s Consumer Duty in the United Kingdom, among other things, requires firms to act to deliver “good outcomes” for retail customers with respect to products and services, price and value, consumer understanding and consumer support. Regulators’ expectations of firms in relation to their compliance, risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firm’s systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues.\nPayments Regulation\nLegislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through enforcement actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad regulatory regimes for payment systems.\nPricing for card acceptance, including interchange fees (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard), has been a focus of legislators and regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU, the United States and other jurisdictions. Recently, certain states in the United States have passed or are considering laws prohibiting interchange from being charged on all or certain components of transactions, such as sales tax and gratuities. Jurisdictions have also sought to regulate various other aspects of network operations and contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance, including information associated with electronic transactions, such as state legislation regarding the use of specific merchant categories codes or limiting the use of transaction data.\nRegulation and other governmental actions relating to operations, pricing or practices could affect all networks and/or acquirers directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants. For example, we exited our network business in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. In 2018, the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) confirmed the validity of fee capping and other provisions in circumstances where three-party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent, although its ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances and remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements. In December 2024, the CJEU held a hearing on questions referred by the Dutch Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal regarding the interpretation of the application of the interchange fee caps in connection with an administrative proceeding by the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets regarding our cobrand relationship with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines; the CJEU has not yet issued a decision. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. See “\nOur business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\n” under “Risk Factors.”\nIn various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU, Australia and Canada (other than in the Province of Quebec), merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants. In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen an increase in merchant surcharging on American Express cards, particularly in certain merchant categories. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. In addition, we also encounter steering or differential acceptance practices by merchants, which could also have a material adverse effect on us. See “\nSurcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations\n” under “Risk Factors.”\n18\nTable of Contents\nIn some countries, governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed and/or to localize aspects of their operations. For example, the Reserve Bank of India, which has broad power under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to regulate the membership and operations of card networks, issued a mandate requiring payment systems operators in India to store certain payments data locally. In 2021, it imposed restrictions on American Express Banking Corp. from engaging in certain card issuing activities in India, which were lifted in 2022 following significant investment in technology, infrastructure and resources to comply with the regulation. The development and enforcement of these and other similar laws, regulations and policies may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network.\nPrivacy, Data Protection, Data Management, Artificial Intelligence, Resiliency, Information Security and Cybersecurity\nRegulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, data management, artificial intelligence, resiliency, information security and cybersecurity continues to increase worldwide. We have established, and continue to maintain, policies and a governance framework to comply with applicable privacy, data protection, data management, artificial intelligence, resiliency, information security and cybersecurity laws and requirements, meet evolving customer and industry expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth; however, our policies and governance framework may be insufficient given the size and complexity of our business and heightened regulatory scrutiny.\nOur regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy, data protection, data management, artificial intelligence, resiliency and cybersecurity-related policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection, use, sharing and/or security practices, to provide them with choices, if required, about how we use and share their information, and to appropriately safeguard their personal information and account access. Regulators are also focused on end-to-end management of data, technology infrastructure and architecture, technology operations, resiliency and business continuity, and third-party risk management policies and practices, with regulatory expectations continuing to increase as we grow in size. For example, the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act, which applies as of January 2025, requires EU financial entities to have a comprehensive governance and risk management framework for information and communications technology risk. In addition, regulators and legislators have heightened their focus on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning through the application of existing laws and regulations as well as by adopting new laws and regulations, such as the EU’s AI Act and state artificial intelligence legislation (e.g., Colorado AI Act). These new and emerging laws and regulations are reshaping how we develop, deploy and manage artificial intelligence systems, including by imposing new obligations related to data use, recordkeeping, transparency and human oversight.\nIn the United States, certain of our businesses are subject to the privacy, disclosure and safeguarding provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and its implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, GLBA imposes certain limitations on our ability to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and requires us to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of our business, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information that we process. We also have expanded privacy-related obligations with respect to California residents who are not covered by GLBA, pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020. Various regulators and other U.S. states and territories are considering similar requirements or have adopted laws, rules and regulations pertaining to privacy and/or information security and cybersecurity that may be more stringent and/or expansive than federal requirements.\nWe are also subject to certain privacy, data protection, data management, artificial intelligence, resiliency, information security and cybersecurity laws in other countries in which we operate (including Member States in the EU, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Singapore, Thailand and the United Kingdom), some of which are more stringent and/or expansive than those in the United States and may conflict with each other. Some jurisdictions have instituted or are considering instituting requirements that make it onerous to transfer personal data to other jurisdictions, and certain countries require in-country data processing and/or in-country storage of data. Compliance with such laws results in higher technology, administrative and other costs for us, could limit our ability to optimize the use of our data, and could require use of local technology services. Some of these laws also require us to provide foreign governments and other third parties broader access to our data and intellectual property. Data breach and operational outage notification laws or regulatory activities to encourage such notifications and regulatory activity and laws around resiliency, business continuity and third-party risk management are also becoming more prevalent in jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe EU and UK General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) impose legal and compliance obligations on companies that process personal data of individuals in the EU and UK, irrespective of the geographical location of the company, with the potential for significant fines for non-compliance (up to 4 percent of total annual worldwide revenue). These laws include, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches, in certain circumstances, to affected individuals and supervisory authorities and restrictions on the cross-border transfers of EU or UK personal data. We rely on a variety of compliant transfer mechanisms to transfer this personal data, including the use of binding corporate rules and standard contractual clauses. In 2023, the EU and UK regulators approved the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Data Bridge, enabling easier transfers of EU and UK personal data to participating companies in the United States. We are also subject to certain data protection laws in Member States in the EU, which may be more stringent than the EU GDPR. Our data protection programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in certain Member States in the EU and we continue to make changes to our privacy practices and data management to comply with these requirements.\nAnti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation, and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment, with respect to compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), sanctions and anti-corruption laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs and policies and procedures for AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance could have material financial, legal and reputational consequences. Additionally, our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or affect our relationships with certain partners, service providers and other third parties.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism\nWe are subject to a significant number of AML/CFT laws and regulations globally. \nIn the United States, the majority of AML/CFT requirements are derived from the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (the AMLA), enacted in January 2021, amended the Bank Secrecy Act and is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. AML/CFT laws. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. \nIn Europe, AML/CFT requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (and preceding EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives) into local laws and regulations. Numerous other countries have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML/CFT legislation and regulations applicable to American Express.\nAmong other things, these laws and regulations generally require us to establish AML/CFT programs that meet certain standards, including policies and procedures to collect information from and verify the identities of our customers, and to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, in addition to other information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. Our AML/CFT programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny and any errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT laws, deficiencies in our AML/CFT programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activity can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions.\nEconomic Sanctions\nNational governments and international bodies, such as the United Nations and the EU, have imposed economic sanctions against individuals, entities, vessels, governments, regions and countries that endanger their interests or violate international norms of behavior. Sanctions have been used to advance a range of foreign policy goals, including conflict resolution, counterterrorism, counternarcotics and promotion of democracy and human rights, among other national and international interests. We maintain a global sanctions compliance program designed to meet the requirements of applicable sanctions regimes. Failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to serious legal and reputational consequences, including criminal penalties.\nThe United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions involving targeted jurisdictions, parties or activities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers most U.S. sanctions. OFAC regulations prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to, or other dealings involving, a targeted individual, entity, vessel, government or country without a license or other authorization. OFAC regulations require U.S. persons to block property and property interests of parties on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List and entities owned 50 percent or more by one or more Specially Designated Nationals. Blocked property (e.g., bank deposits or other financial assets) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Regulatory authorities in other international jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom and Member States in the EU, administer similar programs to U.S. sanction programs.\n20\nTable of Contents\nPursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted outside the United States by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.\nIn 2024, we became aware that a third-party automated teller machine (ATM) network provider maintained a relationship with an Iranian bank identified on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list. As a result, American Express Card Members had the ability to access ATMs located outside of Iran that were operated by the Iranian bank through our ATM authorization program. We have identified approximately 37 such ATM transactions by Card Members. We had negligible gross revenues and net profits attributable to these transactions. We immediately suspended our relationship with the ATM network provider and do not intend to continue to engage in this activity.\nIn 2024, we also identified approximately 30 consumer accounts of individuals that may be, or may have been, employed by the Government of Iran. We believe the accounts were used only for personal expenses. We had negligible gross revenues and net profits attributable to these accounts. All of the accounts are closed and we do not intend to continue to engage in this activity.\nWe voluntarily reported the above transactions and accounts to OFAC.\nAnti-Corruption\nWe are subject to complex anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments. The FCPA makes it illegal to corruptly offer or provide anything of value to foreign government officials, political parties or political party officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an improper advantage. The FCPA also requires us to strictly comply with certain accounting and internal controls standards. The UK Bribery Act also prohibits commercial bribery and the receipt of a bribe, and makes it a corporate offense to fail to prevent bribery by an associated person, in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials. Failure by us or our colleagues, contractors or agents to comply with the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other similar laws can expose us and/or individual colleagues to investigation, prosecution and potentially severe criminal and civil penalties.\nCompensation Practices\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The federal banking regulators’ guidance on sound incentive compensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Any deficiencies in our compensation practices that are identified by the banking regulators in connection with their review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness, and we have not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets. In 2016, the federal banking regulators, the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration proposed revised rules on incentive-based compensation practices, which were reproposed by certain of those agencies in 2024, but have not yet been finalized. If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to what has been proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our colleagues, which could adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate key colleagues.\n21\nTable of Contents\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nWe maintain an Investor Relations website at https://ir.americanexpress.com. We make available free of charge, on or through this website, our annual, quarterly and current reports and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nIn addition, we routinely post financial and other information, some of which could be material to investors, on our Investor Relations website. Information regarding our corporate sustainability initiatives and related disclosures are available on the Corporate Sustainability section of our website at https://go.amex/esg.\nThe content of any of our websites referred to in this report is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. We have included such website addresses only as inactive textual references and do not intend them to be active links.\nOur business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations, although billed business tends to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters. As a result, the amount of Card Member loans and receivables outstanding tend to be moderately higher during that quarter. Additionally, we tend to have a higher proportion of retail-related billed business in the fourth quarter, which on average has a slightly lower merchant discount rate.\n22\nTable of Contents",
    "item1a": "ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS\nThis section highlights certain risks that could affect us and our businesses, broadly categorized in accordance with the risk types identified in our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework: “Strategic & Business, Reputational and Country Risks,” “Operational and Compliance/Legal Risks” and “Model, Credit, Market and Funding & Liquidity Risks.” You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in “Risk Management” under “MD&A,” which describes our approach to identifying, monitoring and managing the risks we assume in conducting our businesses and provides certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks. Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management techniques, may not be fully effective in managing the risks to which we are exposed. For example, while we are currently conducting a comprehensive assessment and uplift of our risk management capabilities and control environment, the outcome may not meet our or our regulators’ expectations.\nThe risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\nStrategic & Business, Reputational and Country Risks\nBusiness and economic conditions are a major driver of our results of operations and difficult conditions in the business and economic environment may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe offer a broad array of products and services to consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products. Slow economic growth, economic contraction or shifts in broader consumer and business trends significantly impact customer behaviors, including spending on our cards, the ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us, demand for fee-based products and services and levels of customers’ deposits with us.\nFactors such as consumer spending and confidence, household income and housing prices, unemployment rates, business investment and inventory levels, bankruptcies, geopolitical instability, public policy decisions, government spending, international trade relationships, tariffs, interest rates, taxes, inflation and deflation (including the effects of related governmental responses), energy costs and availability of capital and credit all affect the economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. Additionally, sustained periods of high inflation may, among other things, increase certain of our expenses and erode consumer purchasing power, confidence and spending. An economic downturn or recession may result in higher unemployment and lower household income, consumer spending, corporate earnings and business investment, which may negatively impact spending on our cards and demand for our products, and increase delinquencies and write-off rates.\nSpending by our premium consumer Card Members, for example, is sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels and tends to decline during general economic downturns. Likewise, spending by small business and corporate clients, which comprised approximately 42 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2024, depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation. The consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the economic environment generally can be sudden and severe and can impact customer types and geographies in which we operate in very different ways.\nOur business is subject to the effects of geopolitical conditions, weather, natural disasters and other catastrophic events.\nGeopolitical conditions, terrorist attacks, military conflicts, supply chain issues, natural disasters, severe weather, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, information or cybersecurity incidents (including intrusion into or degradation or unavailability of systems or technology by cyberattacks), operational incidents and other catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our business. Political and social conditions, including geopolitical instability (such as from tensions involving China and the U.S.), fiscal and monetary policies (including developments related to the U.S. federal deficit, debt ceiling, government shutdowns and other budgetary issues), trade wars and tariffs, labor shortages, regional or domestic hostilities, economic sanctions and the prospect or occurrence of more widespread conflicts could also negatively affect our business, operations and partners, consumer and business spending, including travel patterns and business investment, and demand for credit. Pandemics and other health emergencies can have widespread and unpredictable impacts on global society, economic conditions and consumer and business behavior, which may reoccur or occur over an extended duration, such as the macroeconomic and behavioral impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending and many of our partners’ businesses relate to travel, our business is sensitive to impacts to travel and tourism, such as health and safety concerns and limitations on travel and mobility. In addition, disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel protection products we offer.\nA number of actions are taking place across the globe that impact geopolitical stability. Several countries are considering or have implemented tariffs or other trade barriers or restrictions, as well as other measures affecting cross-border commerce and the flow of information, which could have broad economic consequences, impact global supply chains and negatively affect our business, customers and partners. There are multiple ongoing military conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts) and geopolitical tensions may result in additional conflicts or escalate existing conflicts. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we announced that we suspended business operations in Russia and Belarus, and these conflicts have led to economic uncertainty and market disruptions, including the imposition of sanctions and export controls. The broader consequences remain uncertain, but geopolitical conditions may adversely affect macroeconomic conditions and our business in a number of ways, including regional \n23\nTable of Contents\ninstability, increased prevalence and sophistication of cyberattacks, potential retaliatory action against companies such as us, further sanctions activity and related regulatory scrutiny, increased inflation, further increases or fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, decreases in global travel and further disruptions to the global supply chain. If international political instability and geopolitical tensions continue or increase, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nHurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters have impacted, and may continue to impact, spending and credit performance in the areas affected. For example, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate impact of the Los Angeles area wildfires on spending levels and credit performance. Disasters and catastrophic events, and the impact of such events on certain industries or the overall economy, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and infrastructure, including our technology and systems. Climate-related risks may exacerbate certain of these threats, including the frequency and severity of weather-related events. Card Members in California, Florida, New York, Texas, Georgia and New Jersey account for a significant portion of U.S. consumer and small business billed business and Card Member loans, and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states.\nOur operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.\nThe payments industry is highly competitive, and we compete with networks, issuers, acquirers, and other payment service providers and methods of payment, including paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks) and electronic transfers (e.g., wire transfers and ACH), as well as evolving and growing alternative mechanisms, systems and products (e.g., web- and mobile-based payment platforms). If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, develop compelling value propositions for our customers and/or effectively grow in areas such as digital payments and emerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe believe Visa and Mastercard are larger than we are in most countries based on purchase volume. As a result, card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and Mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position, scale, resources, marketing and pricing of those networks. Our business may also be negatively affected if we are unable to continue increasing merchant acceptance (including by merchants that accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks) and perceptions of coverage, or if our Card Members do not experience welcome acceptance of our cards.\nSome of our competitors have substantially greater scale and resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective strategies to acquire and retain more customers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs, obtain more favorable terms with merchants and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have. Competition may also intensify as participants in the payments industry merge or enter into joint ventures or other business combinations that compete with our products and services. Government actions or initiatives may also provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages and may create new competitors, including in some cases a government entity. We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending and borrowing or merchant acceptance as effectively as our competitors. Costs such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses could continue to increase as we evolve our value propositions, including in response to increased competition.\nSpending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing usage of credit and debit cards issued on other networks and real-time settlement transactions, such as bank transfers, as well as adoption of alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products. The fragmentation of customer spending, such as to take advantage of different merchant or card incentives, as a result of point-of-sale practices that impact merchant acceptance (e.g., surcharging or differential acceptance) or for convenience with technological solutions, may continue to increase. Revolving credit balances on our cards could also be impacted by alternative financing providers, such as point-of-sale lenders and buy now, pay later products. To the extent other payment and financing mechanisms, systems and products continue to successfully expand, our discount revenues earned from Card Member spending and our net interest income earned from Card Member borrowing could be negatively impacted. In addition, companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets, commerce-related experiences, mobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept, suppress use of, or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data. Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets, experiences or applications or negotiate incentives or pricing concessions, impacting our profitability on transactions.\nThe competitive value of our data and demand for our products and services may also be diminished as traditional and non-traditional competitors use other, new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights and by certain regulations. Open banking initiatives that are increasingly being promoted by governments and regulators may result in a number of challenges to our business model, such as disintermediating us from our customers, steering customers away from our products and services or decreasing our attractiveness to partners. Competitors have also sought to create their own integrated payments platforms, and may have competitive advantages in doing so as compared to our business.\nTo the extent we expand into, or further grow in, new business areas, such as new products and services that complement our card products, and new geographic regions, we will face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers, regulators and industry participants, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. Laws and business practices that favor local competitors, require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could limit our growth in international regions. \nWe may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into new business areas, and we may need to dedicate more expense, time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors, particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions.\n24\nTable of Contents\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\nWe face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we work with partners such as Delta, Hilton, Marriott and British Airways to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and with partners in many industries, including Delta, to offer benefits and rewards to Card Members. See “Partners and Relationships” under “Business” for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 25 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2024.\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. Additionally, partners may make changes to the products and services they offer or otherwise become less desirable to our customers, which may lower the value of our products, such as the cobranded cards we issue to our customers. We may also choose not to renew certain cobrand relationships. Billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to such cobranded card portfolio, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See “\nOur business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\n” above for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners.\nArrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and outages, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. For example, our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. For example, the operational rights relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business are owned by a business partner and the reloadable operations have experienced disruptions and compliance issues that impacted the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such operations are interrupted, suspended, terminated or otherwise experience further issues in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers’ experience, result in additional costs, litigation and regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation. We also face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our \n25\nTable of Contents\nfinancial condition and results of operations. See Note 12 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners.\nSimilarly, we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies, liquidations, insolvencies, financial distress, restructurings, consolidations, operational outages, cybersecurity incidents and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and volumes generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. We have previously and may in the future pre-purchase loyalty points from certain of our cobrand partners, the value of which may diminish to the extent such partners cease operations or such points become less desirable to our customers. We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards. For example, we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or “flown.” If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline, we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member. Spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 7 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nFor additional information relating to operational risks of our business partners, see “\nWe rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business\n” below.\nWe face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge for accepting our cards for payment, as well as the risk of losing merchant relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe face pressure from competitors that primarily rely on sources of revenue other than discount revenue or have lower costs that can make their pricing for card acceptance more attractive. Merchants, business partners and third-party merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors are also able to negotiate incentives, pricing concessions and other favorable contractual provisions from us as a condition to accepting our cards, being cobrand partners, offering benefits to our Card Members or signing merchants to accept American Express cards. As these parties become even larger (such as the largest tech companies), we may have to increase the amount of incentives and/or concessions we provide to them. We also face the risk of losing relationships with these parties or that they limit acceptance of our cards, which could materially adversely affect spending on our cards and our ability to retain current Card Members and attract new Card Members and therefore, our business and results of operations.\nOur merchant discount rates have been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries and U.S. states and may in the future be impacted by pricing regulation. We have also experienced erosion of our merchant discount rates as we increase merchant acceptance. We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants. In addition, the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our merchant discount rates. Some merchants, including large tech companies and other large merchants, continue to invest in their own payment and financing solutions, such as proprietary-branded digital wallets, using both traditional and new technology platforms. If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage, it could adversely impact our merchant discount rates and network and loan volumes.\nA continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants that, if not successful, could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results. We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, for the reasons discussed above and others, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value-added services for merchants, business partners and Card Members.\nSurcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn certain countries, such as Australia, Canada (other than in the Province of Quebec) and certain Member States in the EU, and in certain states in the United States, merchants are permitted by law to engage in surcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices for certain card purchases and certain merchants and merchant organizations continue to push for these practices in other jurisdictions. In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen an increase in merchant surcharging on American Express cards, particularly in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that are known as differential surcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant.\nWe also encounter merchants that accept our cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards or certain of our cards, such as limiting the use of our cards for certain transactions. Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members’ expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting discrimination through provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, subject to local legal requirements. We have increasingly relied on merchant acquirers, aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of our merchant relationships. When we work with such third parties, we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards, but they may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\nRecently introduced products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other \n26\nTable of Contents\nforms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in-force, coverage and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, merchant acquirers, aggregators, processors or other merchant service providers, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage or attract new Card Members, including through marketing and promotion, merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services, or to effectively control the costs of such investments, all of which may materially impact our profitability.\nRevenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers’ total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly as consumer and business behaviors continue to change. In addition, to the extent our products or offers attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage, or if merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards or more greatly engage in surcharging, steering or other differential acceptance practices, our business could suffer. Expanding our product and service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our merchant discount rates or dilute our brand.\nAnother way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options, Card Member offers and other rewards and benefits, and we may modify or not be able to continue to offer such rewards and benefits in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. In addition, many credit card issuers and certain other companies have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and other benefits and services that are similar to ours and may be more attractive. An inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to cost-effectively manage and expand Card Member benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future, and our ability to do so will depend in part on our ability to attract value from partners. If such expenses increase beyond our expectations, we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing other areas of revenues such as fee-based revenues, decreasing operating expenses or other investments in our business, or both. We may not succeed in doing so, particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment, which has included heightened scrutiny on credit card rewards programs. In addition, increased costs as a result of business and economic conditions may require that we reduce investments in other areas.\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\nOur brand and its attributes are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand. Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, privacy and data protection, management, workplace culture, merchant acceptance, financial condition, response to political and social issues or catastrophic events and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters — even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct—could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members, corporate clients, merchants and partners, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones, and could subject us to heightened legal and regulatory scrutiny. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including card practices, regulatory compliance, the use and protection of customer information, conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement, including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee, and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto. Moreover, the speed with which information spreads through social media, enhanced technology and other news sources and the ease with which customers transact may amplify the onset and negative effects from such perceptions.\nOur brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related to a third-party service provider, business partner, merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us, thus damaging our reputation and brand value. Our brand may also be negatively impacted by acceptance of American Express cards by merchants in certain industries, when American Express cards are used for payment for legal, but controversial, products and services or any government inquiries or legislative scrutiny related to card acceptance or usage. The lack of acceptance, suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products, lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems. Adverse developments with respect to our industry, including the creation and implementation of new merchant categories codes, may also negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Furthermore, as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the United States and a brand name \n27\nTable of Contents\nreferring to the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. These risks to our brand and reputation, as well as other risks described in this Risk Factors section, are heightened by the increasing sophistication and availability of artificial intelligence technology, including by assisting with the creation of deepfakes and increasing the velocity of distribution of disinformation. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes, revenues and profitability.\nWe face increased scrutiny from stakeholders who have diverging views related to business practices and company activities, which could result in reputational harm, litigation, enforcement actions and other adverse consequences. In addition, we are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and legal risks related to environmental, social and governance topics, such as those arising from new disclosure requirements in certain jurisdictions. Inaccurate perceptions or mischaracterizations of disclosures on these topics, or our goals and initiatives, while outside of our control, could impact our reputation, colleague hiring and retention and public perceptions of our business.\nIf we are not able to successfully invest in, and compete with respect to, technological developments and new products and services across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, customer interactions and communications, open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms, authentication technologies and digital identification, tokenization, real-time settlement and risk management and compliance systems. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services, including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations, requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time, and may have unintended consequences or ultimately be unsuccessful. We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, our existing technology.\nThe process of developing new products and services, enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may develop products, platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted by consumers, merchants or service providers than ours, including as a result of increased involvement by technology companies in the payments industry and our competitors’ greater scale or ability to pursue and adopt new technologies. In addition, we may underestimate the resources needed and overestimate our ability to develop new products and services, particularly beyond our traditional card products and travel-related services.\nThe use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, including generative artificial intelligence, has increased rapidly with the increasing sophistication and applications of the technology. Our and our partners’ use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to various risks including flaws in models or datasets that may result in biased or inaccurate results, unintended or unexpected outcomes, ethical considerations regarding artificial intelligence, infringement of intellectual property rights, exposure of proprietary or personal information, heightened security risks and the ability to safely deploy and implement governance and controls for artificial intelligence systems. The complexity of these technologies can make it difficult to assess proper operation, reduce error, or understand and explain their outputs. Adverse consequences of artificial intelligence and machine learning remain uncertain but could include flaws in the decisions, predictions, outputs or analysis such technologies produce and subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\nOur ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industry-wide standards, a changing legislative and regulatory environment, an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls, a lack of internal product and engineering expertise, resistance to change from Card Members, merchants or service providers, lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems. In addition, our adoption of new technologies and our introduction of new products and services may increase operational complexity and risk, and expose us to new or enhanced risks, particularly in areas where we have less experience or our existing governance and control systems may be insufficient, which could require us to make substantial expenditures or subject us to legal liability, heightened regulatory scrutiny and brand or reputational harm.\nWe may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and investment activity, and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments, and continue to evaluate potential transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately, negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, or complete proposed acquisitions and investments. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including in integrating systems and personnel or further developing the acquired business or technology, result in unanticipated liabilities, including legal claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches (including from not integrating the acquired company, business or technology quickly or appropriately, from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition, from inadequate systems or controls of the acquired company, and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws and regulations), and harm our business generally. Expanding to new businesses, geographies or customer types through acquisitions may subject us to new risks and we may not have the relevant expertise or business structure to achieve the desired results. It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions, and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, including as a result of write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets.\n28\nTable of Contents\nJoint ventures, including our joint ventures in China, the Middle East and Switzerland, and minority investments in companies such as GBTG inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment, including as a result of being subject to different laws or regulations. Joint ventures and other partnerships or minority investments operating in foreign jurisdictions may also face risks from adverse regulatory actions, which could adversely affect their operations or our investment. In addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours and we have been and may in the future be involved in litigation with our joint venture partners and other shareholders and parties related to the joint ventures and investments. We have commercial arrangements with GBTG, including, among other things, a long-term trademark license agreement pursuant to which GBTG uses select American Express marks. GBTG also supports certain of our strategic partnerships and our Commercial Services business. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of a joint venture partner, other shareholders or management of our joint ventures and companies in which we have minority investments may adversely affect the value of our investment or any commercial benefit to us from the relationship, result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand. In addition, trade secrets and other proprietary information we may provide to a joint venture may become available to third parties beyond our control. The ability to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, from time to time we may decide to divest certain businesses or assets. These divestitures may involve significant uncertainty and execution complexity, which may cause us not to achieve our strategic objectives, realize expected cost savings or obtain other benefits from the divestiture and may result in unexpected losses of colleagues or harm to our brand, customers or other partners. Further, during the pendency of a divestiture, we may be subject to risks such as that the transaction may not close or the business to be divested may decline, and if a divestiture is not completed, we may not be able to find another acquiror on similar terms.\nOperational and Compliance/Legal Risks\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed.\nWe consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to, among other things, inadequate or failed processes, people or information systems, or impacts from the external environment, including failures to comply with laws and regulations as well as impacts from relationships with third parties. Operational risk includes, among others, the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement, a failure to monitor a third party’s compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, a failure to adequately monitor and control access to, or use of, data in our systems we grant to third parties or a failure to satisfy our obligations to our customers with respect to our products and services (e.g., rewards and benefits). As processes or organizations are changed or become more complex, we grow in size, new products and services are introduced, such as new lending features, banking products, dining capabilities and digital collectibles, or we become subject to more stringent or complicated regulatory requirements, we may not identify or address new operational risks. Through human error, fraud or malfeasance, conduct risk can result in harm to customers, legal liability, fines, sanctions, customer remediation and brand damage.\nCompliance risk arises from violations of, or failure to conform or comply with, laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures and ethical standards. We need to continually update and enhance our control environment to address operational and compliance risks, and our control environment and related systems have in certain instances not sufficiently detected, and may in the future not sufficiently detect, errors or omissions. Operational and compliance failures, deficiencies in our control environment or an inability to maintain high standards of business conduct can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations.\nA major information or cybersecurity incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services.\nWe and third parties collect, process, transfer, host, store, analyze, retain, provide access to and dispose of account information, payment transaction information, and certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and colleagues in connection with our cards and other products and in the normal course of our business.\nGlobal financial institutions like us, as well as our customers, colleagues, regulators, service providers and other third parties, have experienced a significant increase in information security and cybersecurity risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing, impersonation and identity takeover attempts), artificial intelligence-assisted deepfake attacks and disinformation campaigns, corporate espionage, hacking, website defacement, denial-of-service attacks, exploitation of vulnerabilities and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems and company accounts. These threats have arisen from external parties, as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities. There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors, including criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft and ransom, corporate or nation-state espionage, political agendas, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, intent to disrupt information technology systems and supply chains, and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites. Cyber threat actors, including state-sponsored and nation state actors, have rapidly evolved their techniques and increasingly utilize advanced capabilities, including the integration of advanced forms of artificial intelligence and other new technology, which can increase the efficacy, severity, frequency and ease of execution of cyberattacks.\n29\nTable of Contents\nOur and our partners’ networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to disrupt business operations and capture, destroy, manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information (including Card Member, travel and loyalty program data), colleague information and other sensitive business information (including acquisition activity, non-public financial results and intellectual property). For example, we and other U.S. financial services providers have been the target of attacks, such as denial of service attacks, social engineering and the impersonation of current or prospective employees and contractors. We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information security and cybersecurity incidents and fraudulent activity, including our cyber crisis response procedures, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change, new vulnerabilities and exploits are discovered and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.\nDespite our efforts and the efforts of third parties that process, transmit or store our data and data of our customers and colleagues or support our operations, such as service providers, merchants and regulators, the possibility of information, operational and cybersecurity incidents, malicious social engineering, password mismanagement, corporate espionage, fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is deployed by threat actors, including the use of artificial intelligence and quantum computing, and we increasingly use platforms that are outside of our network and control environments. For example, we are aware that certain of our third-party service providers and joint ventures have been the victims of ransomware and other cyberattacks, in some instances that affected our data or services provided to us. In addition, recently introduced products and services, such as checking accounts and non-card lending, may lead to an increase in the number or types of cyberattacks and our exposure to fraud and other malfeasance. Risks associated with such incidents and activities include theft of funds and other monetary loss, disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, trade secret or other information (including account data information). An incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered. We are subject to varied cybersecurity regulations and incident reporting requirements, which could require us to disclose incidents that may not have been resolved or fully investigated at the time of disclosure, leading to customer confusion, regulatory scrutiny and negative publicity and exacerbating risks related to the incident itself. Our ability to address incidents may also depend on the timing and nature of assistance that may be provided from relevant governmental or law enforcement agencies.\nInformation, operational or cybersecurity incidents, fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, availability of services and data, privacy and/or security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance), consent decrees, increased litigation (including class action litigation), response costs (including notification and remediation costs), fines, negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies, reputational and financial damage to our brand, negative impacts to our partner relationships, and reduced usage of our products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. The disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources.\nSuccessful cyberattacks, data breaches, disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, availability of services and data, privacy and/or security at other large financial institutions, large retailers, travel and hospitality companies, government agencies or other market participants, whether or not we are impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements. Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate.\nThe uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems and those of our third parties, including our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems, and data centers, which have experienced and may continue to experience service disruptions or degradation that may result from technology malfunction, sudden increases in processing or other volumes, natural disasters and weather events, fires, accidents, technology change management issues, power outages, internet outages, telecommunications failures, fraud, denial-of-service, ransomware and other cyberattacks, inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets, technology capacity management issues, terrorism, computer viruses, vulnerabilities or failures in hardware or software, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events. Due to the interconnectivity and complexity of information systems and their reliance on common systems, software and vendors, disruptions or degradations have had, and will likely continue to have, wide-reaching consequences, including the potential to disrupt the overall financial system and other key systems in the global economy. Service disruptions or degradations impacting us or our partners can prevent access to online services and account information, compromise or limit access to company or customer data, impede or prevent transaction processing, communications to customers and financial reporting, disrupt ordinary business operations, result in contractual penalties or obligations, trigger regulatory reporting obligations, and lead to regulatory investigations and fines, increased regulatory oversight, and litigation (including class action litigation). Any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our products and services and materially adversely affect our overall business, reputation and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face significantly heightened regulatory expectations and scrutiny in the U.S. and globally, which significantly affects our business and requires continual enhancement of our compliance efforts. Supervision efforts and the enforcement of existing laws \n30\nTable of Contents\nand regulations impact the scope and profitability of our existing business activities, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and adopt new technologies, compromise our competitive position, and affect our relationships with Card Members, partners, merchants, service providers and other third parties. New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business, increase the costs and complexity of doing business, impact what we are able to charge for, or offer in connection with, our products and services, impose conflicting obligations, and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Political developments can result in legislative and regulatory uncertainty and changes to supervisory and enforcement priorities. In addition, legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other’s approaches to the regulation of the financial services industry. Consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another.\nIf we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions, which could compromise our competitive position. Additionally, our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital. In 2024, we became a Category III firm for purposes of the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’ tailoring framework, resulting in us becoming subject to heightened regulatory expectations and more stringent regulatory requirements. As we continue to grow, these expectations and requirements may further increase, such as if we become a Category II firm, which may increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.\nLegislators and regulators continue to focus on the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, network routing practices and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. While in some cases our business is subject to exemptions related to certain of these regulations, there is no guarantee that such exemptions will continue to be available and even where we are not directly regulated, regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business, including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend, or may extend, to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements, new products or services we may offer, or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, including terms relating to non-discrimination and honor-all-cards. For example, we have exited our network licensing businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions. In addition, there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. See “Supervision and Regulation — Payments Regulation” under “Business” for more information. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, a number of federal and state laws to regulate various aspects of network operations are being considered or have passed, including regarding information associated with electronic transactions (such as the use of specific merchant categories codes or limitations on the use of transaction data) and pricing of electronic transactions (such as interchange fees on sales tax or gratuities).\nLegislators and regulators also continue to focus on consumer protection, including product design and pricing constructs, account management and security, credit bureau reporting, disclosure rules, marketing and debt collection practices. This focus has included fees associated with card and banking products, such as a rule issued by the CFPB related to credit card fees for late payments (which is currently stayed); interest rates, such as recent proposals to cap credit card interest rates; rewards programs, such as the recent inquiries by the CFPB and DOT focused on credit card and airline rewards programs; and factors considered by financial institutions in providing services, such as “fair access” laws. Any new requirements or increased enforcement of existing requirements could materially and adversely impact our revenue growth and profitability, including, as a result of increased scrutiny of our pricing, underwriting and account management practices; the imposition of fines and customer remediation; higher compliance costs; reputational harm; restrictions on our ability to issue cards, appropriately price for the value of our products or work with certain business partners; and changes to our business practices generally.\nWe are subject to significant supervision and regulation with respect to compliance with AML/CFT laws, sanctions regimes and anti-corruption laws in numerous jurisdictions. As regulators increase their focus in these areas, new technologies such as digital currencies develop, near real-time money movement solutions are adopted, we introduce new products like checking accounts and geopolitical tensions increase, we face increased costs related to oversight, supervision and potential fines. Our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny, and we are working to make enhancements to our existing programs, policies and procedures and to identify and remediate deficiencies. For example, we recently voluntarily reported certain transactions and accounts to OFAC, some of which related to Iran, as described in “Supervision and Regulation — Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance” under “Business.” Errors, failures or delays in complying with AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, deficiencies in our related compliance programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activities or sanctioned persons, entities, governments or countries can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions, and our reputation may suffer due to our customers’ association with certain countries, persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions. Additionally, our AML/CFT, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance programs may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or affect our relationships with certain partners, service providers and other third parties.\nSee “Supervision and Regulation” under “Business” for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us.\n31\nTable of Contents\nLitigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and/or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses, damage to our reputation and/or a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAt any given time, we are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits, mass arbitrations and similar actions. Many of these actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages and require us to incur significant costs for legal representation, arbitration fees or other legal or related services. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future, including as a result of legal challenges to, and new regulations affecting, our arbitration provisions, and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities, risks and costs associated with class action cases. The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation.\nWe expect that financial institutions, such as us, will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny, with regulators taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, among other limitations, that could adversely affect our business. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. Further, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries.\nWe are also involved at any given time with governmental and regulatory inquiries, investigations and proceedings. Regulatory scrutiny has continued to increase in a number of areas, and regulatory action could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements, increased expenses, limitations or conditions on our business activities, and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, as previously disclosed, we entered into agreements to resolve governmental investigations related to historical sales practices for certain U.S. small business customers, which are described in more detail in Note 12 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.” In addition, we are cooperating with ongoing regulatory inquiries concerning our rewards and benefits programs, as described in “Supervision and Regulation” under “Business.”\nLegal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts, including non-discrimination and honor-all-cards provisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, changes to our merchant agreements and/or business practices, substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand.\nWe are, and have been in the past, a defendant in a number of actions, including legal proceedings, arbitrations and proposed class actions, challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements. See Note 12 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a description of certain outstanding legal proceedings.\nAn adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience, result in additional litigation and/or arbitrations, impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand. Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements, changes in Visa’s and Mastercard’s policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings, lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability. For example, in 2024 Visa and Mastercard proposed a lawsuit settlement agreement that would have, among other things, required reductions and caps on interchange fees and streamlined requirements for merchants who wish to impose a surcharge on credit transactions. While the settlement agreement was not approved by the court, Visa and Mastercard may ultimately agree or be subject to changes in policies or practices that result in greater surcharging generally or downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with reductions and caps on interchange fees.\nWe rely on third-party providers for acquiring and servicing customers, technology, platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers, cobrand partners, merchants, affiliate marketing firms, processors, aggregators, network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business. As outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data, artificial intelligence and cloud-based solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions, handling our data and supporting our operations. For example, we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network, card acquisition and provision of services to our customers. \nWe have experienced in certain limited circumstances and may continue to experience disruptions or other events at our third parties or our third parties’ service providers, including their failure to fulfill their obligations and the information, cybersecurity and operational incidents described above. Such disruptions or other events could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers, impact the confidentiality, integrity, availability and security of our data, lead to fraudulent transactions on our cards or other products, impact our business, cause brand or reputational damage, and lead to costs associated with responding to such a disruption, including notification and remediation costs, costs to switch service providers or move operations in house, regulatory investigations and fines and increased regulatory oversight and litigation. Third parties may face similar or greater risks as us, including as a result of their relationship with us; however, they may be less prepared to mitigate those risks and may be \n32\nTable of Contents\ntargeted by bad actors as a result, which can result in greater disruptions and other risk events. Third parties may also act in other ways that are inconsistent with our interests or contrary to our strategic or technological initiatives, such as ceasing to provide data to us or using our data in a way that was not authorized or diminishes the value of the transaction data we receive through our integrated payments platform.\nThe management and oversight of an increasing number of third parties increases our operational complexity and governance challenges and decreases our control. Additionally, third-party oversight and practices related to third parties such as outsourcing have become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny both in the United States and internationally, including in some cases restricting or requiring approval for outsourcing. A failure to exercise adequate oversight over third parties, including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements, could result in regulatory actions, fines, litigation, sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us. In addition, we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our third-party providers’ service providers. We are also exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a service provider common to our third parties could impede their ability to provide services to us. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify our reliance on third parties, in certain cases there may be limited alternatives or high costs for diversification, and we also may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to the service providers of our third-party providers.\nOur success is dependent on maintaining a culture of integrity and respect and upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and misconduct by or loss of personnel could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe rely upon our colleagues not only for business success, but also to act with integrity and promote a culture of respect. To the extent our colleagues behave in a manner that does not comport with our company’s values, the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for qualified, highly motivated individuals with diverse perspectives is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain such individuals. The unexpected loss of key personnel could disrupt our business and have an adverse impact on our future performance. Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations or other changes in the legal or regulatory environment can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, or to employ colleagues in the location(s) of our choice. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of AENB are subject to review and oversight by the OCC. This regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. Our inability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled, motivated and diverse personnel could materially adversely affect our business and our culture.\nRegulation in the areas of privacy, data protection, data management, resiliency, data transfer, third party oversight, account access, artificial intelligence and machine learning and information security and cybersecurity could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect and/or use personal information.\nLegislators and regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, data protection, data management, resiliency, data transfer, third party oversight, account access, artificial intelligence and machine learning and information security and cybersecurity laws, including data localization, authentication and notification laws. As such laws are interpreted and applied (in some cases, with significant differences or conflicting requirements across jurisdictions), compliance and technology costs will continue to increase, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate privacy, data protection, data management, incident management, resiliency, third party management, data transfer, security controls, account access mechanisms and controls related to artificial intelligence and machine learning are in place. Additionally, new laws and regulations related to automated decision making, artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as the application of existing laws and regulations to these technologies may restrict or impose burdensome and costly requirements on our ability to use them or impact other aspects of our business.\nCompliance with current or future laws in the aforementioned areas could significantly impact our business operations, including our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or colleague information and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our integrated payments platform or provide certain products and services or work with certain service providers, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with such laws or to maintain sufficient governance and control structures could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, data management, artificial intelligence and machine learning and information security and cybersecurity in the United States, the EU and various other countries in which we operate and our data protection and governance programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny.\nFor more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area, see “Supervision and Regulation — Privacy, Data Protection, Data Management, Artificial Intelligence, Resiliency, Information Security and Cybersecurity” under “Business.”\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual property, or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to, and distribution of, our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. The ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our products, systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, a future assertion of an infringement or \n33\nTable of Contents\nmisappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues, incur significant defense, license, royalty or technology development expenses, and/or pay significant monetary damages. Furthermore, given intellectual property ownership and license rights surrounding artificial intelligence, such as generative artificial intelligence, are currently not fully addressed by courts or regulators, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against infringing use and our use or adoption of artificial intelligence may result in exposure to claims by third parties.\nTax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex, require significant judgment and are subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, they are subject to challenge by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations, which could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities. Refer to Note 20 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for information on the U.S. federal income tax audit of transfer pricing arrangements between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries.\nWe are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities.\nLegislative action or inaction in the countries in which we have operations could increase our effective tax rate. For example, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will impact how multinational enterprises (MNEs) are taxed on their global profits. In particular, the OECD’s guidelines on a global minimum tax of 15 percent will impact the effective tax rate for many MNEs. Many countries have already implemented these minimum tax guidelines, with effective dates commencing in 2024. We expect that these minimum tax guidelines in their current form would increase our effective tax rate in future years. Furthermore, various provisions of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act will expire in 2025 unless extended. As a result, U.S. Congress may seek to enact significant tax legislation in the new session of Congress, which could result in higher levels of U.S. tax on our global operations, increasing our effective tax rate.\nJurisdictions may also make changes related to the tax treatment of card transactions, such as imposing taxes on Card Member rewards or prohibiting interchange fees on sales tax, which could decrease the value we provide to customers and adversely impact our business. \nOur operations, business, customers and partners could be adversely affected by climate-related risks.\nThere are increasing and rapidly evolving concerns over climate-related risks and related environmental sustainability and recovery matters. We face physical risks related to climate, including rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters. Such events and disasters could disrupt our operations or the operations of customers or third parties on which we rely and could result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers’ spending behaviors or ability to pay outstanding loans. Additionally, we may face risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Changes in consumer preferences, travel patterns and legal requirements could impact our revenues or expenses or otherwise adversely affect our business, our customers and partners.\nWe may not be able to effectively identify, measure or control our exposure to climate-related risks, particularly given that the timing, nature and severity of the impacts of these risks may not be predictable. We could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of our climate-related initiatives and goals. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these goals, which depend in part on third-party performance, data that is outside of our control and methodologies that may evolve over time. We could be required to change our business, management practices and partnerships, incur expenses from changes to our technology, operations, products and services, and experience reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced stakeholder confidence, due to our response or perceived lack of response to climate and environmental issues.\nModel, Credit, Market and Funding & Liquidity Risks\nOur use of models to manage risk and make business decisions may not be effective.\nWe use models and automation throughout our business, including to inform and support decision making, manage risks and estimate financial values. Although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation, the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused. In addition, issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures, as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs, could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports. For example, models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes, such as because of changes in the credit profile of our Card Members, and they may not be able to predict future outcomes. Additionally, we increasingly use models that leverage artificial intelligence, which are subject to additional risks such as biased or inaccurate results or lowered interpretability. Our models also may not be able to function properly in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment given the lack of recent precedent. Certain models, such as models for credit loss accounting under Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) and Membership Rewards liability, require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments, and utilize forward-looking information. If our business decisions or financial estimates are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to manage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect Card Member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to both individual credit risk, principally from consumer and small business Card Member loans and receivables, and institutional credit risk, principally from corporate Card Member loans and receivables, merchants, network partners, loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties. Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. General economic factors, such as recession, unemployment, inflation and interest rates, may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses. A customer’s ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic, market, political and social conditions but also by a customer’s other payment obligations, and increasing leverage can result in a higher risk that customers will default or become delinquent in their obligations to us.\nWe rely principally on the customer’s creditworthiness for repayment of loans or receivables and therefore often have no other recourse for collection. Our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired as a result of changes in our underwriting practices or if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. This may be exacerbated to the extent information we have historically relied upon to make credit decisions does not accurately portray a customer’s creditworthiness, including as a result of the current interest rate and economic conditions. Further, our pricing strategies, particularly for new lending features and non-card lending products, may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses; thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us. Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete.\nRising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for credit losses. Higher write-off rates and the resulting increase in our reserves for credit losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds.\nAlthough we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. In addition, our ability to manage credit risk or collect amounts owed to us may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws, minimum payment regulations and re-age guidance) or changes in customer behavior (such as the increased use of debt settlement companies). Increased credit risk, whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables, deteriorating economic conditions (particularly in the United States, as U.S. Card Members were responsible for approximately 88 percent of our total Card Member loans outstanding as of December 31, 2024), increases in the level of loan balances, changes in our mix of business or otherwise, could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInterest rate changes could materially adversely affect our earnings.\nWe had net interest income of approximately $15.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net interest income, could decrease. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change as benchmark interest rates change. For example, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have raised interest rates in response to heightened inflationary pressures. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements, further impacting our results of operations. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see “Risk Management ― Market Risk Management Process” under “MD&A.”\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules, and if we fail to meet these rules, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve, or the OCC with respect to AENB, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, invest in our business, expand our business or engage in acquisitions. Some elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions. For example, in 2023 the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies proposed capital rules that would result in significantly higher regulatory capital requirements for us and rules that would require us and AENB to issue and/or maintain minimum amounts of eligible long-term debt with specific terms. In addition, it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital because of an increase in the SCB requirement based on results from a supervisory stress test.\nCompliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources. An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules or supervisory expectations regarding capital and liquidity risk management capabilities and practices may also negatively impact the assessment of us and AENB by federal banking regulators. Additionally, we are subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements as a result of becoming a Category III firm, which may further increase if we grow to become a Category II firm.\nFor more information on capital adequacy requirements, see “Supervision and Regulation — Capital and Liquidity Regulation” under “Business.”\n35\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock. Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us, which may adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators, who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. We are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve for review that include, among other things, projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock. As part of the capital planning and stress testing process, our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment. If we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, including the stress capital buffer, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted.\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our preferred stock.\nWe rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and such dividends may be limited by law, regulation or supervisory policy. For example, AENB is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends. These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations, make dividend payments or otherwise achieve strategic objectives.\nAny future reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American Express. For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see “Supervision and Regulation — Stress Testing and Capital Planning” and “— Dividends and Other Capital Distributions” under “Business,” as well as “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity — Dividends and Share Repurchases” under “MD&A” and Note 22 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nAdverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. Additional factors affecting the extent to which we may securitize loans and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and receivables, the demand for credit card asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” under “MD&A.”\nAny reduction in our credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRatings of our long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, and the macroeconomic environment. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends, in part, on the credit ratings of the securities we issue from our securitization trusts. If we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirements to confirm the ratings of our asset-backed securities, it could limit our ability to access the securitization markets.\nAdverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations.\nDuring 2024, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nPolitical and economic conditions could continue to cause changes in the values of currencies and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our net revenues. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members’ currency can also affect their ability to make payment to us. Foreign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them and the availability of foreign exchange could further impact our results of operations.\nAn inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.\nOur U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, accepts deposits and uses the proceeds as a source of funding, with our direct retail deposits becoming a larger proportion of our funding over time. We continue to face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted. Additionally, a decrease in confidence in the soundness of us or in the banking sector more broadly, such as following the occurrence of bank failures, or in the level of insurance available on deposits may cause rapid deposit withdrawals or an unwillingness to maintain deposits with us, \n36\nTable of Contents\nwhich could materially adversely affect us and our ability to fund our business. The use of social media and similar channels has the potential to intensify and accelerate such a decrease in confidence in soundness.\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB’s capital levels. The FDIA’s brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. Additionally, our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business.\nThe value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions.\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our financial condition. We have experienced realized and unrealized losses in our Amex Ventures\n™\n equity investments and may experience further losses in the future. As of December 31, 2024, we held approximately $1.2 billion of investment securities, primarily consisting of debt securities, and equity investments, including certain equity method investments, totaling approximately $2.0 billion. Negative market conditions, changes in valuations or increases in default rates or bankruptcies with respect to these investments, due to economic conditions, business performance or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investments, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Defaults, threats of defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us.\n37\nTable of Contents",

Operational risk is incorporated into our comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, which we use to identify, aggregate, monitor, report and manage risks. For more information on our ERM program, see “Risk Management” under “MD&A.”\nOur Technology Risk and Information Security (TRIS) program, which is our enterprise information security and cybersecurity program incorporated in our ERM program and led by our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), is designed to (i) ensure the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information and information systems; (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of such information and information systems; and (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information or information systems that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us, our colleagues or our customers. The TRIS program is built upon a foundation of advanced security technology, employs a highly trained team of experts and is designed to operate in alignment with global regulatory requirements. The program deploys multiple layers of controls, including embedding security into our technology investments, designed to identify, protect, detect, respond to and recover from information security and cybersecurity incidents. Those controls are measured and monitored by a combination of subject matter experts and a security operations center with integrated cyber detection, response and recovery capabilities. The TRIS program includes our Enterprise Incident Response Program, which manages information security incidents involving compromises of sensitive information, and our Cyber Crisis Response Plan, which provides a documented framework for handling high-severity security incidents and facilitates coordination across multiple parts of the Company to manage response efforts. We also routinely perform simulations and drills at both a technical and management level, and our colleagues receive annual cybersecurity awareness training.\nIn addition, we incorporate reviews by our Internal Audit Group and external expertise in our TRIS program, including an \nindependent third-party assessment of our cybersecurity measures and controls and a third-party cyber maturity assessment of our TRIS program against the Cyber Risk Institute Profile standards for the financial sector\n. We also invest in threat intelligence, collaborate with our peers in areas of threat intelligence, vulnerability management, incident response and drills, and are active participants in industry and government forums.\nCybersecurity risks related to third parties are managed as part of our \nThird Party Management Policy\n, which sets forth the procurement, risk management and contracting framework for managing third-party relationships commensurate with their risk and complexity. Our Third Party Lifecycle Management (TLM) program sets guidelines for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and reporting the risks associated with third parties through the life cycle of the relationships, which includes planning, due diligence and third-party selection, contracting, ongoing monitoring and termination. Our TLM program includes the identification of third parties with risks related to information security. Third parties that access, process, collect, share, create, store, transmit or destroy our information or have access to our systems may have additional security requirements depending on the levels of risk, such as enhanced risk assessments and monitoring, and additional contractual controls.\nWhile we do not believe that our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition have been materially adversely affected by any cybersecurity incidents, cybersecurity threats are pervasive and, similar to other global financial institutions, we, as well as our customers, colleagues, regulators, service providers and other third parties, have experienced a significant increase in information security and cybersecurity risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of cyberattacks.\n We continue to assess the risks and changes in the cyber environment, invest in enhancements to our cybersecurity capabilities, and engage in industry and government forums to promote advancements in our cybersecurity capabilities, as well as the broader financial services cybersecurity ecosystem. For more information on risks to us from cybersecurity threats, see “\nA major information or cybersecurity incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure, and could reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services\n.” under “Risk Factors.”\n38\nTable of Contents\nCybersecurity Governance\nUnder our cybersecurity governance framework, our Board and Risk Committee are primarily responsible for overseeing and governing the development, implementation and maintenance of our TRIS program, with our Board designating our Risk Committee to provide oversight and governance of technology and cybersecurity risks.\n \nOur \nBoard\n receives an update on cybersecurity at least once a year from our CISO or their designee. Our Risk Committee receives reports on cybersecurity at least twice a year, including in at least one joint meeting with our Audit and Compliance Committee, and our Board and these committees all receive ad hoc updates as needed. In addition, our Risk Committee annually approves our TRIS program.\nWe have multiple internal management committees that are responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity risk. Our Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC), chaired by our Chief Operational Risk Officer, provides oversight and governance for our information security risk management activities, including those related to cybersecurity. This includes efforts to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report information security risks associated with our information and information systems and potential impacts to the American Express brand. The ORMC escalates risks to our Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer, or our Board based on the escalation criteria provided in our enterprise-wide risk appetite framework. Members of management with cybersecurity oversight responsibilities are informed about cybersecurity risks and incidents through a number of channels, including periodic and annual reports, with the annual report also provided to our Risk Committee, the ORMC and ERMC.\nOur \nCISO\n leads the strategy, engineering and operations of cybersecurity across the Company and is responsible for providing annual updates to our Board, the ERMC and the ORMC on our TRIS program, as well as ad hoc updates on information security and cybersecurity matters.\n \nOur current CISO has held a series of roles in telecommunications, networking and information security at American Express, including promotion to the CISO role in 2013, and is also responsible for technology risk management. Prior to joining American Express, our current CISO served in a variety of technology leadership roles at a public pharmaceutical and biotechnology company for 14 years. Our CISO reports to the Chief Information Officer, information about whom is included in “Information About Our Executive Officers” under “Business.”\nFor more information on our risk governance structure, see “Risk Management — Governance” and “Risk Management —Operational Risk Management Process” under “MD&A.”\n39\nTable of Contents"
