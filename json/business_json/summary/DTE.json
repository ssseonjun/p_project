Environmental regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste .\n The Registrants could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants . Increased environmental regulation may also result in greater energy efficiency requirements and decreased demand at both the electric and gas utilities . Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed in Michigan, the United States, and worldwide to reduce GHGs .\n The Registrants are subject to existing Michigan, and potential future, federal legislation and regulation requiring them to secure sources of clean and renewable energy . Any perceived or alleged failure by the Registrants to comply with environmental regulations could lead to fines or penalties imposed by regulatory bodies .

The price of renewable natural gas investments may also impact the market and financial results for DTE Energy's non-utility business .\n At DTE Electric, high winds, floods, tornadoes, or ice storms can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities . The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process . Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of the Registrants' assets, lowering income and cash flows . There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy's approximately 4,800 employees .\n Registrants are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on their costs of operations and financial performance . DTE Energy may not achieve the carbon emissions goals of its electric and gas utilities . Technology research and developments, innovations, and advancements may not evolve as anticipated . State and municipal restrictions on the siting of renewable energy assets could also impair efforts to meet our stated targets .\n DTE Energy could suffer financial loss, reputational damage, litigation, or other negative repercussions if we are unable to meet our voluntary emissions reductions goals . The company's non-utility businesses may not perform to its expectations . Credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance .\n The Registrants' costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and government regulation .\n The Registrants' ability to access capital markets is important to operate their businesses . Turmoil in credit markets may constrain the ability of Registrants and their subsidiaries to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and to refinance existing debt .

Rising interest rates could also reduce investor interest in DTE Energy's common stock .\n Advances in technology that produce power or reduce power consumption could have a material adverse effect on the Registrants . DTE Energy's participation in energy trading markets subjects it to risk . Energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose DTE energy to risks related to commodity price movemen .
