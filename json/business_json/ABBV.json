AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.\nAbbVie's pipeline currently includes approximately 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on important specialties including immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, approximately 50 are in mid- and late-stage development.\nThe following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registrational programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.\nSignificant Programs and Developments\nImmunology\nRinvoq\n•\nIn January 2024, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate Rinvoq in adults and adolescents with non-segmental vitiligo who are eligible for systemic therapy.\n•\nIn April 2024, AbbVie announced positive top-line results from its Phase 3 SELECT-GCA trial for Rinvoq in combination with a 26-week steroid taper regimen in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) achieved its primary endpoint.\n•\nIn April 2024, AbbVie announced positive top-line results from the head-to-head Phase 3b/4 Level-Up trial evaluating Rinvoq compared to dupilumab in adolescent and adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.

This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.\nPercent change\nAt actual currency rates\nAt constant currency rates\nyears ended (dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nUnited

presented on a constant currency basis.\nGlobal Humira sales decreased 37% in 2024. In the United States, Humira sales decreased 41% in 2024 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition following loss of exclusivity on January 31, 2023. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 13% in 2024 primarily driven by the continued impact of direct biosimilar competition.\nNet revenues for Skyrizi increased 51% in 2024 primarily driven by continued strong market share uptake as well as market growth across all indications.\nNet revenues for Rinvoq increased 53% in 2024 primarily driven by continued strong market share uptake as well as market growth across all indications.\nNet revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues decreased 7% in 2024 primarily driven by decreased demand and lower market share in the United States as well as decreased collaboration revenues.\nNet revenues for Venclexta increased 16% in 2024 primarily driven by continued market share uptake and market growth across all indications.\nNet revenues for Elahere were $479 million in 2024 for the period subsequent to the completion of the ImmunoGen acquisition.\n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n40\n                                                         \nNet revenues for Botox Cosmetic increased 3% in 2024. In the United States, Botox Cosmetic net revenues increased 1% primarily driven by favorable pricing, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of customer inventory destocking and decreased consumer demand. Internationally, Botox Cosmetic net revenues increased 7% primarily driven by favorable pricing and increased consumer demand across key international markets.\nNet revenues for Juvederm Collection decreased 12% in 2024 primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of decreased consumer demand and customer inventory destocking.\nNet revenues for Botox Therapeutic increased 11% in 2024 primarily driven by continued market share uptake as well as market growth.\nNet revenues for Vraylar increased 18% in 2024 primarily driven by continued market share uptake as well as market growth.\nNet revenues for Ubrelvy increased 23% in 2024 primarily driven by continued market share uptake as well as market growth.\nNet revenues for Qulipta increased 61% in 2024 primarily driven by continued strong market share uptake as well as market growth.\nGross Margin\nPercent change\nyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\nGross margin\n$\n39,430 \n$\n33,903 \n$\n40,640 \n16 \n%\n(17)\n%\nas a percent of net revenues\n70 \n%\n62 \n%\n70 \n%\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2024 increased compared to 2023.

See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to debt issued to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics acquisitions.\nInterest income in 2024 increased compared to 2023 primarily due to a higher average cash and cash equivalents balance and the impact of higher interest rates.\nOther expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $3.8 billion in 2024 and $5.1 billion in 2023. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. In 2024, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2023, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, the passage of time and lower discount rates.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe effective income tax rate was (15%) in 2024, 22% in 2023 and 12% in 2022. The effective income tax rate fluctuates year to year due to the allocation of the company’s taxable earnings among jurisdictions, as well as certain discrete factors and events in each year, including changes in tax law and business development activities. The effective income tax rates in 2024, 2023 and 2022 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations with lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, the U.S. global minimum tax, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, tax audits and settlements, tax credits and incentives in the United States, Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and business development activities. The effective income tax rate in 2024 was lower than prior periods due to the resolutions of various tax positions pertaining to multiple prior tax years, including the closing of U.S. IRS examinations covering three tax years, partially offset by increases in unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to prior years. The lower effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects an increase due to acquisition costs related to certain business development activities and a decrease related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The effective income tax rate in 2023 was higher than prior periods due to increased changes in fair value of contingent consideration, intangible asset impairments and the impacts of the transition from the Puerto Rico excise tax to an income tax.\n In 2022, Puerto Rico enacted Act 52-2002 (the Puerto Rico Act) allowing for a transition from a Puerto Rico excise tax levied on gross inventory purchases to an income-based tax beginning in 2023. The company completed the transition \n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n42\n                                                         \nrequirements of the Puerto Rico Act in 2022, resulting in the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on income tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The net tax benefit recognized in 2022 from the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Puerto Rico Act was $323 million.\nOur net earnings and cash flows could be affected by future tax policy and law changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including changes in tax law related to the projects undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These projects include a global minimum tax rate of 15%, referred to as \"Pillar Two\", and the creation of a new global system to tax income based on the location to which products are sold, referred to as \"Pillar One.\" Numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the OECD model rules and European Union member states have agreed to implement Pillar Two. This implementation includes aspects of legislation that were effective starting in 2024. Significant details around the provision are still emerging. These potential changes increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact income tax expense in future years. We will continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by individual countries and evaluate the potential impact on our business in future periods.\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash flows provided by (used in)\nOperating activities\n$\n18,806 \n$\n22,839 \n$\n24,943 \nInvesting activities\n(20,820)\n(2,009)\n(623)\nFinancing activities\n(5,211)\n(17,222)\n(24,803)\nOperating cash flows in 2024 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of working capital and higher contingent consideration payments classified as operating cash flows, partially offset by increased results from operations driven by higher net revenues. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie’s contributions to its defined benefit plans of $326 million in 2024 and $366 million in 2023.\nInvesting cash flows in 2024 included $18.5 billion cash consideration paid to acquire ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics offset by cash acquired of $952 million, net sales and maturities of investment securities of $482 million, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $3.0 billion and capital expenditures of $974 million. Investing cash flows in 2023 included payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.2 billion, capital expenditures of $777 million and net purchases of investments securities totaling $22 million.\nFinancing cash flows in 2024 included the issuance of unsecured senior notes totaling $15.0 billion aggregate principal which were used to finance the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics. Additionally, financing cash flows included the issuance and repayment of $5.0 billion under the term loan credit agreement and repayments of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.60% senior notes, €1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.38% senior euro notes, €700 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% senior euro notes, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.85% senior notes, $99 million of secured term notes assumed from ImmunoGen in conjunction with the acquisition and settlement of $400 million aggregate amount of 2.5% convertible senior notes assumed from Cerevel Therapeutics. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the company refinanced its $2.0 billion floating rate three-year term loan. As part of the refinancing, the company repaid the existing $2.0 billion term loan due May 2025 and borrowed $2.0 billion under a new term loan due April 2027. \nFinancing cash flows in 2023 included repayment of $1.0 billion floating rate three-year term loan, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.85% senior notes and $350 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.80% senior notes. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023 the company also repaid €500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% senior euro notes and $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior notes at maturity.\nFinancing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $11.0 billion in 2024 and $10.5 billion in 2023. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase of the dividend rate.\nThe company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. AbbVie repurchased 7 million shares for $1.3 billion in 2024 and 10 million shares for $1.6 billion in 2023. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2024. On February 16, 2023, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase authorization.\nDuring 2024, the company issued and redeemed $7.7 billion of commercial paper. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, AbbVie issued commercial paper borrowings of which $3.3 billion were outstanding as of date of filing of this Annual Report \n43 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \non Form 10-K. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.\nCredit Risk\nAbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.\nCredit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings\nCredit Facility\nIn December 2023, in connection with the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics, AbbVie entered into a $9.0 billion 364-day bridge credit agreement and $5.0 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement. In February 2024, AbbVie borrowed and repaid $5.0 billion under the term loan credit agreement. AbbVie also issued $15.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in February 2024. Subsequent to the issuance of these senior notes, AbbVie terminated both the bridge and term loan credit agreements in the first quarter of 2024. \nAbbVie currently has an existing $5.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in March 2028. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, in addition to the existing revolving credit facility, AbbVie entered into a new $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in January 2030. The revolving credit facilities enable the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contain various covenants. At December 31, 2024, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facilities as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAccess to Capital\nThe company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.\nCredit Ratings\nIn August 2024, Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) affirmed its A3 senior unsecured long-term rating. At the same time, Moody’s revised its outlook to positive from stable. There were no other changes in the company’s credit ratings during 2024. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements. However, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt.\nFuture Cash Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024:\n(in millions)\nTotal\nCurrent\nLong-term\nLong-term debt, including current portion\n$\n66,841 \n$\n6,771 \n$\n60,070 \nInterest on long-term debt\n(a)\n36,040 \n2,764 \n33,276 \nContingent consideration liabilities\n(b)\n21,666 \n2,589 \n19,077 \n(a)\nIncludes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2024. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to \n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n44\n                                                         \nobligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2024. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2024.\n(b)\nIncludes contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. \nAbbVie enters into certain unconditional purchase obligations and other commitments in the normal course of business. There have been no changes to these commitments that would have a material impact on the company’s ability to meet either short-term or long-term future cash requirements.\nIncome Taxes\nFuture income tax cash requirements include a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax liability was $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 and is payable in two future annual installments. \nLiabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2024. It is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nOn October 30, 2024, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company’s quarterly dividend from $1.55 per share to $1.64 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 14, 2025 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2025. This reflects an increase of approximately 5.8% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.\nCollaborations, Licensing and Other Arrangements\nAbbVie enters into collaborative, licensing and other arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nAbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. \n45 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nRebates \nAbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities.\nRebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $59.3 billion in 2024, $56.8 billion in 2023 and $41.4 billion in 2022. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.\nIn order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.\nThe following table is an analysis of the three largest accruals for rebates and chargebacks, which comprise approximately 92% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2024. \n(in millions)\nMedicaid\n and\n Medicare\n Rebates\nManaged\n Care\n Rebates\nWholesaler\nChargebacks\nBalance as of December 31, 2021\n$\n3,816 \n$\n3,097 \n$\n902 \nProvisions\n11,713 \n14,119 \n13,070 \nPayments\n(10,331)\n(12,974)\n(12,829)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n5,198 \n4,242 \n1,143 \nProvisions\n15,153 \n23,978 \n14,191 \nPayments\n(15,054)\n(21,200)\n(14,162)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n5,297 \n7,020 \n1,172 \nProvisions\n15,866 \n24,127 \n14,782 \nPayments\n(13,756)\n(25,622)\n(14,797)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n7,407 \n$\n5,525 \n$\n1,157 \nOther Allowances\nOther allowances include cash discounts, product returns, sales incentives and other adjustments, which are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. Reserves for cash discounts and sales incentives are readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Cash discounts totaled $2.0 billion in 2024, $2.0 billion in 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022.\nPension and Other Post-Employment Benefits\nAbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e., duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects \n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n46\n                                                         \nthe plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For certain plans, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. \nAbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2024. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2025 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2024:\n50 basis point\n(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)\nIncrease\nDecrease\nDefined benefit plans\nNet periodic benefit cost\n$\n(25)\n$\n39 \nProjected benefit obligation\n(596)\n664 \nOther post-employment plans\nNet periodic benefit cost\n$\n(5)\n$\n6 \nProjected benefit obligation\n(46)\n51 \nThe expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2024 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2025. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2025 by $109 million.\nThe health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2024 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2025. \nIncome Taxes\nAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nLitigation\nThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. In-process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an \n47 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nindefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.\nAbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAnnually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. \nFor its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease projected cash flows and the estimated fair value of the related intangible assets. Future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.\nContingent\n \nConsideration\nThe fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs, which are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.\n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n48\n                                                         \nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n2024\n2023\nas of December 31 (in millions)\nContract amount\nWeighted average exchange rate\nFair and carrying value receivable/(payable)\nContract amount\nWeighted average exchange rate\nFair and carrying value receivable/(payable)\nReceive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies:\nEuro\n$\n10,590 \n1.094 \n$\n183 \n$\n10,707 \n1.107 \n$\n(99)\nCanadian dollar\n1,042 \n1.365 \n39 \n1,244 \n1.329 \n(8)\nJapanese yen\n836 \n148.386 \n40 \n726 \n139.636 \n2 \nBritish pound\n461 \n1.271 \n(1)\n505 \n1.271 \n(1)\nAll other currencies\n2,308 \nn/a\n17 \n2,742 \nn/a\n(31)\nTotal\n$\n15,237 \n$\n278 \n$\n15,924 \n$\n(137)\nThe company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.5 billion at December 31, 2024. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the company has unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated €3.1 billion aggregate principal amount of these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the net investment hedging program. \nInterest Rate Risk\nThe company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $140 million at December 31, 2024. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $4.6 billion at December 31, 2024. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. \n49 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nITEM

                                            \nAbbVie Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 \nBackground \nBackground\nThe principal business of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers systems to agree on reimbursement terms. \nAbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of \n100\n% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders.\nAbbVie completed its previously announced acquisitions of ImmunoGen, Inc. (ImmunoGen) on February 12, 2024 and Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Cerevel Therapeutics) on August 1, 2024. See Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information regarding these acquisitions\n.\nNote 2 \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \nUse of Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation.\nRevenue Recognition\nAbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less. \nCash discounts, rebates and chargebacks, sales incentives, product returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by \n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n56\n                                                         \nproduct and by payer. For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nInternal R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\n \nAcquired IPR&D and Milestones Expenses \nIn an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&D projects are expensed as acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and development milestone payments related to R&D collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop, manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.\n \nBusiness Combinations\nAbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\nIn a business combination, the fair value of IPR&D projects acquired is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&D costs incurred by the company after the acquisition are expensed to R&D as incurred.\n \nCollaborations and Other Arrangements\nThe company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements and subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of development milestones prior to regulatory approval are expensed to acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n Advertising expenses were $\n2.1\n billion in 2024, $\n2.2\n billion in 2023 and $\n2.0\n billion in 2022.\n57 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nPension and Other Post-Employment Benefits\nAbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are generally amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a \nfive-year\n period.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nCash and Equivalents\nCash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.\nInvestments\nInvestments consist primarily of equity securities, held-to-maturity debt securities, marketable debt securities and time deposits. Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until realized, at which time the gains or losses are recognized in earnings.\nAbbVie periodically assesses its marketable debt securities for impairment and credit losses. When a decline in the fair value of marketable debt security is due to credit related factors, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. When AbbVie determines that a non-credit related impairment has occurred, the amortized cost basis of the investment, net of allowance for credit losses, is written down with a charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any impairments and credit losses that were recorded in net earnings.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are stated at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and is determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, other currently available information including customer financial condition and both current and forecasted economic conditions.\n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n58\n                                                         \nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs.\n Inventories consisted of the following:\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nFinished goods\n$\n1,173\n \n$\n1,356\n \nWork-in-process\n1,951\n \n1,643\n \nRaw materials\n1,057\n \n1,100\n \nInventories\n$\n4,181\n \n$\n4,099\n \nProperty and Equipment, Net\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nLand\n$\n284\n \n$\n286\n \nBuildings\n2,895\n \n2,827\n \nEquipment\n7,995\n \n7,449\n \nConstruction in progress\n1,093\n \n1,073\n \nProperty and equipment, gross\n12,267\n \n11,635\n \nLess accumulated depreciation\n(\n7,133\n)\n(\n6,646\n)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n5,134\n \n$\n4,989\n \nDepreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for buildings ranges from \n10\n to \n50\n years. Buildings include leasehold improvements which are amortized over the lesser of the remainder of the lease term or the useful life of the leasehold improvement. The estimated useful life for equipment ranges from \n2\n to \n25\n years. Equipment includes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over \n3\n to \n10\n years.\n Depreciation expense was $\n764\n million in 2024, $\n752\n million in 2023 and $\n778\n million in 2022.\nLeases\nShort-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.\n For leases commencing or modified in 2019 or later, AbbVie does not separate lease components from non-lease components.\nThe company records lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. AbbVie generally uses an incremental borrowing rate to discount its lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the lease is typically not readily determinable. Certain lease agreements include renewal options that are under the company's control. AbbVie includes optional renewal periods in the lease term only when it is reasonably certain that AbbVie will exercise its option. \nVariable lease payments include payments to lessors for taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs as well as payments that are adjusted based on an index or rate. The company's lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nLitigation and Contingencies\nLoss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash \n59 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nflows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.\nThe company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease projected cash flows and the estimated fair value of the related intangible assets. Future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.\nForeign Currency Translation\nForeign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n \nDerivatives\nAll derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. \nFor derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings.\nThe company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI. \nDerivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n60\n                                                         \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nASU No. 2024-03\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued \nAccounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40\n). The standard requires further disaggregation of relevant expense captions in a separate note to the financial statements. The standard is effective for AbbVie starting in annual periods in 2027 and interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted.

Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive. \nThe following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method:\nYears ended December 31,\n(in millions, except per share data)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBasic EPS\nNet earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc.\n$\n4,278\n \n$\n4,863\n \n$\n11,836\n \nEarnings allocated to participating securities\n40\n \n43\n \n54\n \nEarnings available to common shareholders\n$\n4,238\n \n$\n4,820\n \n$\n11,782\n \nWeighted average basic shares of common stock outstanding\n1,769\n \n1,768\n \n1,771\n \nBasic earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc.\n$\n2.40\n \n$\n2.73\n \n$\n6.65\n \nDiluted EPS\nNet earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc.\n$\n4,278\n \n$\n4,863\n \n$\n11,836\n \nEarnings allocated to participating securities\n40\n \n43\n \n54\n \nEarnings available to common shareholders\n$\n4,238\n \n$\n4,820\n \n$\n11,782\n \nWeighted average shares of common stock outstanding\n1,769\n \n1,768\n \n1,771\n \nEffect of dilutive securities\n4\n \n5\n \n7\n \nWeighted average diluted shares of common stock outstanding\n1,773\n \n1,773\n \n1,778\n \nDiluted earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc.\n$\n2.39\n \n$\n2.72\n \n$\n6.63\n \nCertain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive.

Cerevel Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of differentiated therapies for neuroscience diseases. Cerevel Therapeutics neuroscience pipeline includes multiple clinical-stage and preclinical candidates with the potential to treat several diseases including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and mood disorders. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie acquired all outstanding shares of Cerevel Therapeutics for $\n45.00\n per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred to owners of Cerevel Therapeutics common stock was $\n8.7\n billion ($\n8.3\n billion, net of cash acquired).\nThe acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2024. As a result, AbbVie recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Finalization of the valuation during the measurement period could result in a change in the amounts recorded for the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets, goodwill and income taxes among other items. The completion of the valuation will occur no later than one year from the acquisition date. \n63 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nThe following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:\n(in millions)\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed\nCash and equivalents\n$\n361\n \nShort-term investments\n382\n \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n9\n \nProperty and equipment, net\n25\n \nInvestments\n121\n \nIntangible assets, net\n8,100\n \nOther noncurrent assets\n31\n \nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n(\n400\n)\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n(\n100\n)\nLong-term debt\n(\n246\n)\nDeferred income taxes\n(\n1,292\n)\nOther long-term liabilities\n(\n31\n)\nTotal identifiable net assets\n6,960\n \nGoodwill\n1,702\n \nTotal assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n$\n8,662\n \nIntangible assets relate to $\n8.1\n billion of acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the \"income approach\" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.\nThe current portion of long-term debt assumed by AbbVie consists of $\n345\n million aggregate principal of \n2.5\n% convertible senior notes due 2027. Upon acquisition, the convertible senior notes became callable and note holders could redeem the convertible senior notes for cash at a premium. As of the acquisition date, the convertible senior notes were recognized as current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets at an aggregate fair value of $\n400\n million. Following the acquisition date, the company repaid the convertible senior notes and there were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2024. \nLong-term debt assumed by AbbVie relates to funding agreements entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics prior to the acquisition. Under the agreements, Cerevel Therapeutics received funding to support development of tavapadon and agreed to repay regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalties contingent upon approval of tavapadon by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The funding agreements were accounted for as financing arrangements and the fair value of the related financing liability was $\n246\n million as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the financing liability was determined using a probability-weighted expected payment model for regulatory milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for sales milestones and royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Assumptions inherent in the development of fair value include discount rates, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving milestones and estimated amounts of future sales. See Note 10 and Note 11 for additional information.\nGoodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics represents expected synergies, including the ability to: (i) expand AbbVie’s neuroscience pipeline, (ii) leverage AbbVie’s commercial, regulatory and clinical expertise to maximize Cerevel Therapeutic’s assets and (iii) enhance AbbVie’s existing neuroscience discovery capabilities. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n64\n                                                         \nAbbVie also assumed a licensing agreement entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) prior to the acquisition. Under the agreement, Cerevel Therapeutics was granted an exclusive global license under certain Pfizer patent rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize compounds included in Cerevel Therapeutic’s pipeline. AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $\n1.6\n billion upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones for all programs. Additionally, AbbVie will pay tiered royalties on net revenues.\nFollowing the acquisition date, the operating results of Cerevel Therapeutics have been included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2024, operating losses attributable to Cerevel Therapeutics were $\n4.9\n billion, inclusive of an \nintangible asset impairment charge\n of $\n4.5\n billion related to emraclidine. See Note 7 for additional information. Operating losses attributable to Cerevel Therapeutics also included $\n161\n million of cash-settled, post-closing expense for Cerevel Therapeutics employee incentive awards. AbbVie issued \n0.3\n million RSUs to holders of Cerevel Therapeutics equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Stock compensation expense related to RSUs issued at the acquisition date was not significant. \nAcquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $\n44\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and were included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nAcquisition of ImmunoGen, Inc. \nOn February 12, 2024, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of ImmunoGen. ImmunoGen is a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) for cancer patients. ImmunoGen's oncology portfolio includes its flagship cancer therapy Elahere, a first-in-class ADC approved for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and a pipeline of promising next-generation ADC's targeting hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The combination accelerates AbbVie’s entry into the solid tumor space and strengthens its oncology pipeline. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie acquired all outstanding shares of ImmunoGen for $\n31.26\n per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred to owners of ImmunoGen common stock was $\n9.8\n billion ($\n9.2\n billion, net of cash acquired).\nThe acquisition of ImmunoGen has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was finalized during the three months ended December 31, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the final fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:\n(in millions)\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed\nCash and equivalents\n$\n591\n \nAccounts receivable\n171\n \nInventories\n211\n \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n40\n \nProperty and equipment, net\n7\n \nIntangible assets, net\nDeveloped product rights\n7,200\n \nLicense agreements\n125\n \nAcquired in-process research and development\n1,280\n \nOther noncurrent assets\n273\n \nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n(\n99\n)\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n(\n312\n)\nDeferred income taxes\n(\n899\n)\nOther long-term liabilities\n(\n47\n)\nTotal identifiable net assets\n8,541\n \nGoodwill\n1,249\n \nTotal assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n$\n9,790\n \nThe fair value step-up adjustment to inventories of $\n179\n million was amortized to cost of products sold when the inventory was sold to customers during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n65 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nIntangible assets relate to $\n7.3\n billion of definite-lived intangible assets and $\n1.3\n billion of acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately \n12\n years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the \"income approach\" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors.\nOther noncurrent assets primarily consist of $\n250\n million of deferred tax assets. \nThe current portion of long-term debt assumed by AbbVie was repaid concurrent with the acquisition at the fair value of $\n99\n million. See Note 10 for additional information.\nGoodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of ImmunoGen represents expected synergies including, the ability to: (i) expand AbbVie’s product portfolio as well as the potential to increase revenue from future growth platforms, (ii) accelerate AbbVie’s clinical and commercial presence in the solid tumor space within oncology, (iii) leverage the respective strengths of each company, and (iv) enhance AbbVie’s existing ADC development efforts. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nFollowing the acquisition date, the operating results of ImmunoGen have been included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2024, net revenues attributable to ImmunoGen were $\n578\n million and operating losses attributable to ImmunoGen were $\n682\n million, inclusive of $\n349\n million of cash-settled, post-closing expense for ImmunoGen employee incentive awards, $\n179\n million of inventory fair value step-up amortization and $\n157\n million of intangible asset amortization. AbbVie also issued \n0.3\n million RSUs to holders of ImmunoGen equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Stock compensation expense related to RSUs issued at the acquisition date was not significant. \nAcquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $\n59\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and were included in SG&A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. \nPro Forma Financial Information\nThe following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie, ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics for 2024 and 2023 as if the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics had occurred on January 1, 2023:\nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet revenues\n$\n56,389\n \n$\n54,691\n \nNet earnings\n4,564\n \n2,862\n \nThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie, ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisitions on January 1, 2023 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired; the incremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory; the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition; and the reclassification of acquisition-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 to the year ended December 31, 2023. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisitions been completed on January 1, 2023. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisitions.\n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n66\n                                                         \nAcquisition of DJS Antibodies Ltd\nIn October 2022, AbbVie entered into an agreement to acquire DJS Antibodies Ltd (DJS) including its lead program DJS-002 and proprietary HEPTAD platform. DJS-002 is an LPAR1 antagonist antibody currently in preclinical studies for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases. HEPTAD platform is a potential novel approach to antibody discovery with specific capabilities targeting transmembrane protein targets. The aggregate purchase price of $\n287\n million was comprised of a $\n255\n million upfront cash payment and $\n32\n million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, for which AbbVie may owe up to $\n95\n million in future payments upon achievement of certain development milestones. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As of the acquisition date, AbbVie acquired $\n233\n million of intangible assets for in-process research and development, $\n22\n million of intangible assets for developed product rights and $\n60\n million of deferred tax liabilities. Other assets and liabilities assumed were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $\n92\n million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.\nOther Licensing & Acquisitions Activity \nCash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $\n3.0\n billion in 2024, $\n1.2\n billion in 2023 and $\n539\n million in 2022. AbbVie recorded acquired IPR&D and milestones expense of $\n2.8\n billion in 2024, $\n778\n million in 2023 and $\n697\n million in 2022. Significant arrangements impacting 2024, 2023 and 2022, some of which require contingent milestone payments, are summarized below.\nNimble Therapeutics, Inc.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of Nimble Therapeutics, Inc. (Nimble). Nimble is a biotechnology company dedicated to delivering on the promise of oral peptide therapeutics and its lead asset, an investigational oral peptide IL23R inhibitor, is in preclinical development for the treatment of psoriasis. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie made an upfront cash payment of approximately $\n200\n million at closing to acquire all outstanding equity of Nimble. AbbVie could make additional future payments of up to $\n130\n million upon the achievement of certain development milestones. The accounting impact of this acquisition will be included in the consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of 2025. \nAliada Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.\nIn December 2024, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of Aliada Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (Aliada) including its lead program ALIA-1758 and accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition. ALIA-1758 is an anti-pyroglutamate amyloid beta (3pE-Aβ) antibody in development for the treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie made an upfront cash payment of approximately $\n1.4\n billion to acquire all outstanding equity of Aliada which was recorded in acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in the fourth quarter of 2024. \nCelsius Therapeutics, Inc.\nIn June 2024, AbbVie acquired Celsius Therapeutics, Inc. (Celsius Therapeutics) including its lead pipeline asset CEL383. Celsius Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of precision medicine in inflammatory bowel disease. The transaction was accounted as an asset acquisition as CEL383 represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The upfront payment of $\n250\n million was recorded in acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in the second quarter of 2024.\nSyndesi Therapeutics SA\nIn February 2022, AbbVie acquired Syndesi Therapeutics SA and its portfolio of novel modulators of the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, including its lead molecule ABBV-552, previously named SDI-118, and accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition. ABBV-552 is a small molecule, which is being evaluated to target nerve terminals to enhance synaptic efficiency. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie made an upfront payment of $\n130\n million which was recorded in acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in the first quarter of 2022. The agreement also includes additional future payments of up to $\n870\n million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones.\n67 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nJuvise Pharmaceuticals\nIn June 2022, AbbVie and Laboratories Juvise Pharmaceuticals (Juvise) entered into an asset purchase agreement where Juvise acquired worldwide commercial rights of a mature brand Pylera, which is used for the treatment of peptic ulcers with an infection by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. The transaction was accounted for as the sale of an asset. Upon completion of the transaction, AbbVie received net cash proceeds of $\n215\n million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $\n172\n million which was recorded in other operating income in the consolidated statement of earnings in the second quarter of 2022. \nOther Arrangements\nIn addition to the significant arrangements described above, AbbVie entered into several other arrangements resulting in charges related to upfront payments of $\n975\n million in 2024, $\n582\n million in 2023 and $\n315\n million in 2022.\n In connection with the other individually insignificant early-stage arrangements entered into in 2024, AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $\n10.1\n billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Acquired IPR&D and milestones expense also included development milestones of $\n130\n million in 2024, $\n196\n million in \n2023\n and $\n252\n million in \n2022\n.\n \nNote 6 \nCollaborations \nThe company has ongoing transactions with other entities through collaboration agreements. The following represent the significant collaboration agreements impacting 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nCollaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc.\nIn December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of Imbruvica, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and certain compounds structurally related to Imbruvica, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States.\nThe collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize Imbruvica outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $\n200\n million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately \n60\n% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining \n40\n% of collaboration development costs.\nIn the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of Imbruvica are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.\nOutside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize Imbruvica. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.\n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n68\n                                                         \nThe following table shows the profit and cost sharing relationship between Janssen and AbbVie:\nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnited States - Janssen's share of profits (included in cost of products sold)\n$\n1,140\n \n$\n1,245\n \n$\n1,607\n \nInternational - AbbVie's share of profits (included in net revenues)\n899\n \n931\n \n1,142\n \nGlobal - AbbVie's share of other costs (included in respective line items)\n162\n \n228\n \n268\n \nAbbVie’s receivable from Janssen, included in accounts receivable, net, was $\n237\n million at December 31, 2024 and $\n236\n million at December 31, 2023. AbbVie’s payable to Janssen, included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, was $\n282\n million at December 31, 2024 and $\n307\n million at December 31, 2023.\nCollaboration with Genentech, Inc.\nAbbVie and Genentech, Inc. (Genentech), a member of the Roche Group, are parties to a collaboration and license agreement executed in 2007 to jointly research, develop and commercialize human therapeutic products containing BCL-2 inhibitors and certain other compound inhibitors which includes Venclexta, a BCL-2 inhibitor used to treat certain hematological malignancies. AbbVie shares equally with Genentech all pre-tax profits and losses from the development and commercialization of Venclexta in the United States. AbbVie pays royalties on Venclexta net revenues outside the United States. \nAbbVie manufactures and distributes Venclexta globally and is the principal in the end-customer product sales. Sales of Venclexta are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Genentech's share of United States profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold.

The intangible assets will be amortized using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the acquisitions.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the company made a decision to reduce current sales and marketing investment related to both CoolSculpting, a body contouring technology for aesthetic nonsurgical fat reduction, and Liletta, an on-market women’s health product. Each of these strategic decisions contributed to significant decreases in the estimated future cash flows for the respective products and represented triggering events that required an evaluation of the underlying definite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The company used a discounted cash flow analysis for both products. For CoolSculpting, the fair value of $\n290\n million was lower than the carrying value of $\n1.3\n billion resulting in a partial impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. For Liletta, the fair value of $\n241\n million was lower than the carrying value of $\n561\n million resulting in a partial impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $\n1.4\n billion to costs of products sold in the consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023.\nIn August 2023, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the company’s oncology product Imbruvica sold in the United States (U.S.) was included on the list of products subject to government-set prices by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The selection resulted in a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying definite-lived intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of $\n1.9\n billion, which was lower than the carrying value of $\n4.0\n billion and resulted in a partial impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount as of August 29, 2023. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $\n2.1\n billion to \ncost of products sold\n in the consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2023. \nIn September 2022, the company made a strategic decision to reduce ongoing sales and marketing investment related to Vuity, an on-market product to treat presbyopia. This strategic decision contributed to a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying definite lived-intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the intangible asset resulting in a full impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $\n770\n million to cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2022.\nFair value measurements for the above evaluations were based on Level 3 inputs including estimated net revenues, cost of products sold, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs and discount rate. \nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between \n1\n to \n16\n years with an average of \n12\n years for developed product rights and \n11\n years for license agreements. Amortization expense was $\n7.6\n billion in 2024, $\n7.9\n billion in 2023 and $\n7.7\n billion in 2022 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. \nThe anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2024 is as follows:\n(in billions)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nAnticipated annual amortization expense\n$\n7.3\n \n$\n6.7\n \n$\n6.1\n \n$\n6.3\n \n$\n5.7\n \n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n70\n                                                         \nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The increase in indefinite-lived intangible assets during 2024 was primarily due to the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the acquisitions.\nThe company performs its annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. \nIn November 2024, the company announced that its two Phase 2 EMPOWER trials investigating emraclidine as a once-daily, oral monotherapy treatment for adults with schizophrenia who are experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, did not meet their primary endpoint of showing a statistically significant reduction (improvement) in the change from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score compared to the placebo group at week 6. The results of these trials represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment which resulted in a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of $\n2.4\n billion, which was lower than the carrying value of $\n6.9\n billion and resulted in a partial impairment of the intangible asset carrying amount as of November 11, 2024. The fair value measurement was based on Level 3 inputs including estimated net revenues, cost of products sold, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs and discount rates. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $\n4.5\n billion to \nresearch and development expense\n in the consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024. \nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the company made a decision to revise the research and development plan for AGN-151607, a novel investigational neurotoxin for the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation in cardiac surgery patients. This decision contributed to a delay in the estimated timing of regulatory approval as well as a significant decrease in estimated future cash flows of the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value which was below the carrying value of the intangible asset. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $\n630\n million to \nresearch and development\n expense in the consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2023.\nNote 8 \nRestructuring Plans \nAbbVie continuously evaluates its operations to identify opportunities to optimize its manufacturing and R&D operations, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs and to respond to changes in its business environment. As a result, AbbVie management periodically approves individual restructuring plans to achieve these objectives. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, no such plans were individually significant. Restructuring charges recorded were $\n189\n million in 2024, $\n132\n million in 2023 and $\n241\n million in 2022 and were primarily related to employee severance and contractual obligations.

The notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of AbbVie and will rank equally in right of payment with all of AbbVie’s existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations. AbbVie may redeem the fixed-rate senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount or the sum of present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the fixed-rate senior notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may also redeem the fixed-rate senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $\n99\n million and debt discounts totaled $\n37\n million, which are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nAbbVie used the net proceeds received from the issuance of the notes to finance the acquisition of ImmunoGen, repay its term-loan, repay commercial paper borrowings, pay fees and expenses in respect of the foregoing, finance general corporate purposes and, together with cash on hand, fund AbbVie’s acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics. See Note 5 for additional information.\nIn December 2023, AbbVie entered into a $\n9.0\n billion 364-day bridge credit agreement and $\n5.0\n billion 364-day term loan credit agreement. In February 2024, AbbVie borrowed and repaid $\n5.0\n billion under the term loan credit agreement. Interest charged on this borrowing was based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate Reference Rate (SOFR) +\n0.975\n% with an effective interest rate of \n6.29\n%. Subsequent to the $\n15.0\n billion issuance of senior notes, AbbVie terminated both the bridge and term loan credit agreements in the first quarter of 2024. In February 2024, concurrent with the ImmunoGen acquisition, the company assumed and repaid an ImmunoGen senior secured term loan at a fair value of $\n99\n million.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, the company assumed $\n345\n million aggregate principal of \n2.5\n% convertible senior notes due 2027. Upon acquisition, the convertible senior notes became callable and note holders could redeem the convertible senior notes for cash at a premium. As of the acquisition date, the convertible senior notes were recognized as current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets at an aggregate fair value of $\n400\n million. Following the acquisition date, the company repaid the convertible senior notes and there were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\nThe company also assumed funding agreements entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics prior to the acquisition. Under the agreements, Cerevel Therapeutics received funding to support development of tavapadon and agreed to repay regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalties contingent upon approval of tavapadon by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In addition, upon acquisition the company has the option to satisfy payment obligations early by making a payment equal to the amount of funding provided to Cerevel Therapeutics plus a variable premium. In all circumstances, total repayments under the funding agreements will not exceed $\n531\n million in aggregate. The funding agreements were accounted for as financing arrangements and the fair value of the related financing liability was $\n246\n million as of the acquisition date. In conjunction with the funding agreements, AbbVie also assumed security agreements entered into by \n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n76\n                                                         \nCerevel Therapeutics prior to the acquisition pursuant to which Cerevel Therapeutics granted the funding investors a security interest in the assets material to the development and commercialization of tavapadon in the United States.\nRepayment and Issuance of Long-Term Debt\nIn 2024, the company repaid $\n3.8\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n2.60\n% senior notes, €\n1.5\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n1.38\n% senior euro notes, €\n700\n million aggregate principal amount of \n1.25\n% senior euro notes and $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n3.85\n% senior notes. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the company refinanced its $\n2.0\n billion floating rate three-year term loan. As part of the refinancing, the company repaid the existing $\n2.0\n billion term loan due May 2025 and borrowed $\n2.0\n billion under a new term loan due April 2027 at a fixed rate of \n4.549\n%. These term notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the fixed-rate term notes between fifteen and twenty-one months at a redemption price equal to the notional amount plus one percent make whole amount and can be redeemed at par after twenty-one months. All other significant terms of the loan remained unchanged after the refinancing.\nIn 2023, the company repaid a $\n1.0\n billion floating rate three-year term loan, $\n350\n million aggregate principal amount of \n2.80\n% senior notes and $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n2.85\n% senior notes at maturity. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the company also repaid €\n500\n million aggregate principal amount of \n1.50\n% senior euro notes and $\n1.3\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n3.75\n% senior notes at maturity.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, AbbVie issued and redeemed $\n7.7\n billion of commercial paper. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, AbbVie issued commercial paper borrowings of which $\n3.3\n billion were outstanding as of date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There were \nno\n commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings was \n4.91\n% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.\nAbbVie currently has an existing $\n5.0\n billion \nfive-year\n revolving credit facility that matures in March 2028. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, in addition to the existing revolving credit facility, AbbVie entered into a new $\n3.0\n billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in January 2030. The revolving credit facilities enable the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contain various covenants. At December 31, 2024, the company was in compliance with all covenants and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. \nNo\n amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facilities as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \nContingencies and Guarantees\nIn connection with the separation, AbbVie has indemnified Abbott for all liabilities resulting from the operation of AbbVie's business other than income tax liabilities with respect to periods prior to the distribution date and other liabilities as agreed to by AbbVie and Abbott. AbbVie has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote.\nNote 11 \nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value Measures\nRisk Management Policy\nThe company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and \nnone\n of the company's outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required.\nFinancial Instruments\nVarious AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the \n77 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nfunctional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling \n$\n1.9\n billion at December 31, 2024 and $\n1.8\n billion at December 31, 2023, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than \n18\n months. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2024 are reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding \nsix months\n from the date of settlement.\nIn 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $\n10.0\n billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in 2019 and the resulting net gain was included in AOCI. This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt. \nThe company was a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges that matured in November 2022. The effect of the hedge contracts was to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. Realized and unrealized gains or losses were included in AOCI and reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt.\nIn June 2023, the company entered into a cross-currency swap contract that matured in November 2023 with a notional amount totaling €\n433\n million to hedge the company’s exposure to changes in future cash flows of foreign currency denominated debt related to changes in foreign exchange rates. The cross-currency swap contract was designated as a cash flow hedge and effectively converted the interest and principal payments of the related foreign currency denominated debt to U.S. dollars. The unrealized gains and losses on the contract were included in AOCI and reclassified to net foreign exchange loss over the term of the related debt. \nThe company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated debt, trade payables, receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange gains or loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $\n5.9\n billion at December 31, 2024 and $\n7.9\n billion at December 31, 2023.\nThe company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of €\n3.1\n billion at December 31, 2024 and €\n5.4\n billion December 31, 2023. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling €\n6.2\n billion, SEK\n1.4\n billion, CAD\n500\n million and CHF\n50\n million at December 31, 2024 and €\n4.9\n billion, SEK\n1.4\n billion, CAD\n750\n million and CHF\n50\n million at December 31, 2023. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges.

Equity securities primarily consist of investments for which the fair values were determined by using the published market prices per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. \nThe financing liability is related to funding agreements entered into by Cerevel Therapeutics prior to the acquisition and assumed by AbbVie. The funding agreements represent financial instruments that are accounted for as financing arrangements and the company elected to account for the financing liability in accordance with the fair value option, as permitted under ASC 825 \nFinancial Instruments\n. The fair value measurement of the financing liability was determined based on significant unobservable inputs. Potential payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for regulatory milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for sales milestones and royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the financing liability can result from changes to one \n81 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nor a number of inputs, including discount rates, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving milestones and estimated amounts of future sales. The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and included a charge of $\n82\n million in 2024. The change in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk is recognized in other comprehensive loss and was not significant. \nThe fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. \nThe fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs:\n2024\n2023\nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\nRange\nWeighted Average\n(a)\nRange\nWeighted Average\n(a)\nDiscount rate\n4.6\n% - \n5.2\n%\n4.8\n%\n4.3\n% - \n5.9\n%\n4.5\n \n%\nProbability of payment for royalties by indication\n(b)\n100\n%\n100\n%\n89\n% - \n100\n%\n99\n \n%\nProjected year of payments\n2025\n - \n2034\n2029\n2024\n - \n2034\n2027\n(a)\nUnobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities.\n(b)\nExcluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment was \n89\n% at December 31, 2023.\nThere have been \nno\n transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. \nThe following table presents the changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs:\nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n19,890\n \n$\n16,384\n \n$\n14,887\n \nAdditions\n(a)\n—\n \n—\n \n32\n \nChange in fair value recognized in net earnings\n3,771\n \n5,128\n \n2,761\n \nPayments\n(\n1,995\n)\n(\n1,622\n)\n(\n1,296\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n21,666\n \n$\n19,890\n \n$\n16,384\n \n(a)\nAdditions during the year ended December 31, 2022, represent contingent consideration liabilities assumed in the DJS acquisition.\nThe change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and included charges of $\n3.8\n billion in 2024, $\n5.1\n billion in 2023 and $\n2.8\n billion in 2022. In 2024, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2023, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, the passage of time and lower discount rates. In 2022, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. \nContingent consideration payments of amounts up to the initial acquisition date fair value are classified as cash outflows from financing activities and payments of amounts in excess of the initial acquisition date fair value are classified as cash outflows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n82\n                                                         \nCertain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value. \nThe book values, approximate fair values and bases used to measure the approximate fair values of certain financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 are shown in the table below:\nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nBook value \nApproximate fair values\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets\n (Level 1)\nSignificant other observable inputs\n (Level 2)\nSignificant unobservable inputs\n (Level 3)\nLiabilities\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations, excluding fair value hedges\n$\n6,797\n \n$\n6,767\n \n$\n6,620\n \n$\n147\n \n$\n—\n \nLong-term debt and finance lease obligations, excluding fair value hedges and financing liability\n60,243\n \n55,836\n \n53,441\n \n2,395\n \n—\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n67,040\n \n$\n62,603\n \n$\n60,061\n \n$\n2,542\n \n$\n—\n \nThe book values, approximate fair values and bases used to measure the approximate fair values of certain financial instruments as of December 31, 2023 are shown in the table below: \nBasis of fair value measurement\n(in millions)\nBook value \nApproximate fair values\nQuoted prices in active markets for identical assets\n (Level 1)\nSignificant other observable inputs\n (Level 2)\nSignificant unobservable inputs\n (Level 3)\nLiabilities\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations, excluding fair value hedges\n$\n7,191\n \n$\n7,069\n \n$\n6,862\n \n$\n207\n \n$\n—\n \nLong-term debt and finance lease obligations, excluding fair value hedges\n52,460\n \n49,541\n \n48,983\n \n558\n \n—\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n59,651\n \n$\n56,610\n \n$\n55,845\n \n$\n765\n \n$\n—\n \nAbbVie also holds investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values.

Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities.\nThe investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The 2024 target investment allocation for the AbbVie Pension Plan was \n62.5\n% in equity securities, \n22.5\n% in fixed income securities and \n15\n% in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension Plan or of any other plans.\nThe expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions.\nExpected Benefit Payments\nThe following table summarizes total benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants including payments funded from both plan and company assets:\nyears ending December 31 (in millions)\nDefined\n benefit plans\nOther\n post-employment plans\n2025\n$\n363\n \n$\n42\n \n2026\n383\n \n46\n \n2027\n410\n \n49\n \n2028\n435\n \n53\n \n2029\n464\n \n57\n \n2030 to 2034\n3,007\n \n330\n \nDefined Contribution Plan\nAbbVie maintains defined contribution savings plans for the benefit of its eligible employees. The expense recognized for these plans was $\n425\n million in 2024, $\n398\n million in 2023 and $\n474\n million in 2022. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees.\nNote 13 \nEquity \nStock-Based Compensation\nIn May 2021, stockholders of the company approved the AbbVie Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program (the Amended Plan), which amends and restates the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP). AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the Amended Plan, which provides for several different forms of benefits, including non-qualified stock options, RSUs and various \nperformance-based awards. Under the Amended Plan, a total of \n144\n million shares of AbbVie common stock have been reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees. \nAbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age \n55\n or older and have at least \n10\n years of service.\n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n88\n                                                         \nStock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP and the Amended Plan and is summarized as follows:\nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCost of products sold\n$\n55\n \n$\n46\n \n$\n38\n \nResearch and development\n341\n \n278\n \n232\n \nSelling, general and administrative\n515\n \n423\n \n401\n \nPre-tax compensation expense\n911\n \n747\n \n671\n \nTax benefit\n159\n \n136\n \n122\n \nAfter-tax compensation expense\n$\n752\n \n$\n611\n \n$\n549\n \nRealized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $\n84\n million in 2024, $\n90\n million in 2023 and $\n116\n million in 2022. \nIn addition to stock-based compensation expense included in the table above and in connection with the acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics, AbbVie incurred cash-settled, post-closing expense for ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics employee incentive awards, which is summarized in the table below:\nyear ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\nCost of products sold\n$\n36\n \nResearch and development\n184\nSelling, general and administrative\n290\nTotal post-closing cash settled expense\n$\n510\n \nStock Options\nStock options awarded to employees typically have a contractual term of \n10\n years and generally vest in one-third increments over a \n3-year\n period. The exercise price is equal to at least \n100\n% of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model.

As of December 31, 2024, $\n6\n million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next \ntwo years\n. \nRSUs and Performance Shares\nRSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees generally vest in ratable increments over a \nthree\n-year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period.\nThe majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees are performance-based. Equity awards granted to senior executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a \nthree-year\n performance period and may be earned based on AbbVie’s return on invested capital (ROIC) performance relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life science \n89 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \ncompanies.

The performance shares have the potential to vest over a \nthree-year\n performance period and may be earned based on AbbVie’s EPS achievement and AbbVie’s total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs and performance shares generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the quoted price of AbbVie’s common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. \nThe following table summarizes AbbVie RSU and performance share activity for 2024:\n(share units in thousands)\nShare units\nWeighted-average grant date fair value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n10,739\n \n$\n136.42\n \nGranted\n5,558\n \n168.62\n \nGranted in acquisitions\n605\n \n168.24\n \nVested\n(\n6,052\n)\n128.28\n \nForfeited\n(\n463\n)\n152.79\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n10,387\n \n$\n159.52\n \nThe fair market value of RSUs and performance shares (as applicable) vested was $\n1.1\n billion in 2024, $\n1.0\n billion in 2023 and $\n1.0\n billion in 2022.\nIn connection with the ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics acquisitions, AbbVie issued \n0.6\n million RSUs to holders of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics equity awards based on a conversion factor described in each of the transaction agreements.

The effective income tax rates in 2024, 2023 and 2022 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations with lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, the U.S. global minimum tax, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, tax audits and settlements, tax credits and incentives in the United States, Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and business development activities. The effective income tax rate in 2024 was lower than prior periods due to the resolutions of various tax positions pertaining to multiple prior tax years, including the closing of U.S. IRS examinations covering three tax years, partially offset by increases in unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to prior years. The lower effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects an increase due to acquisition costs related to certain business development activities and a decrease related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The effective income tax rate in 2023 was higher than prior periods due to increased changes in fair value of contingent consideration, intangible asset impairments and the impacts of the transition from the Puerto Rico excise tax to an income tax.\nIn 2022, Puerto Rico enacted Act 52-2022 (the Puerto Rico Act) allowing for a transition from a Puerto Rico excise tax levied on gross inventory purchases to an income-based tax beginning in 2023. The company completed the transition requirements of the Puerto Rico Act in 2022, resulting in the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities \n93 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nbased on income tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The net tax benefit recognized in 2022 from the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Puerto Rico Act was $\n323\n million.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law in December 2017, resulting in significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, including a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed. The Act also created a U.S. global minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The company’s accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nas of December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nDeferred tax assets\nCompensation and employee benefits\n$\n215\n \n$\n519\n \nAccruals and reserves\n1,253\n \n1,113\n \nChargebacks and rebates\n1,354\n \n1,431\n \nAdvance payments\n66\n \n298\n \nNet operating losses and other carryforwards\n15,815\n \n14,316\n \nOther\n2,156\n \n2,259\n \nTotal deferred tax assets\n20,859\n \n19,936\n \nValuation allowances\n(\n14,823\n)\n(\n13,478\n)\nTotal net deferred tax assets\n6,036\n \n6,458\n \nDeferred tax liabilities\nExcess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets\n(\n1,969\n)\n(\n1,535\n)\nExcess of book basis over tax basis in investments\n(\n302\n)\n(\n374\n)\nOther\n(\n718\n)\n(\n746\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(\n2,989\n)\n(\n2,655\n)\nNet deferred tax assets \n$\n3,047\n \n$\n3,803\n \nThe decrease in deferred tax assets is primarily related to a decrease in compensation, employee benefits and advance payments. The increase in deferred tax liabilities is primarily due to the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics and ImmunoGen in which the company recorded the excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets, offset by amortization and impairment of intangible assets. \nThe company had valuation allowances of $\n14.8\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and $\n13.5\n billion as of December 31, 2023. These were principally related to foreign and state net operating losses and other credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized.\nThe company incurred carryforward deductions in a foreign jurisdiction where realization of the future income tax benefit was, in previous reporting periods, considered so remote that the income tax benefit was not recognized as a deferred tax asset. In 2024, the company concluded that the future income tax benefit of the carryforward balances is no longer remote and therefore, a deferred tax asset was recognized. The company also recognized an offsetting valuation allowance, resulting in no net impact to deferred tax assets as such carryforward balances are not expected to be realized in the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the company had U.S. federal, state and foreign credit carryforwards of $\n669\n million as well as U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $\n38.9\n billion, which will expire at various times through 2044. The company also had foreign loss carryforwards of $\n33.3\n billion that have no expiration.\nUnremitted foreign earnings subject to the Act’s transition tax are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings or eligible for the 100 percent foreign dividends received deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. However, the company generally considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g., capital gain distributions) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax liability is not practicable to determine.\n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n94\n                                                         \nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nyears ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n5,762\n \n$\n5,670\n \n$\n5,489\n \nIncrease due to current year tax positions\n173\n \n129\n \n88\n \nIncrease due to prior year tax positions\n454\n \n109\n \n243\n \nDecrease due to prior year tax positions\n(\n1,741\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n33\n)\nSettlements\n(\n284\n)\n(\n86\n)\n(\n7\n)\nIncrease due to acquisitions\n82\n \n—\n \n—\n \nLapse of statutes of limitations\n(\n45\n)\n(\n39\n)\n(\n110\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n4,401\n \n$\n5,762\n \n$\n5,670\n \nIf recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $\n4.3\n billion in 2024 and $\n5.6\n billion in 2023. The \"Increase due to current year tax positions\" and \"Increase due to prior year tax positions\" in the table above include amounts related to federal, state and international tax items. \nAbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized a gross income tax benefit of $\n179\n million in 2024 and gross income tax expense of $\n430\n million in 2023 and $\n339\n million in 2022 for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross interest and penalties of $\n1.4\n billion at December 31, 2024, $\n1.6\n billion at December 31, 2023 and $\n1.1\n billion at December 31, 2022. \nThe company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible that the company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by up to $\n40\n million in connection with statute of limitation expirations. The company has various federal, state and foreign examinations ongoing. Finalizing examinations with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and as a result, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of resolution for certain unrecognized tax benefits. All significant federal, state and international tax matters have been concluded for years before 2009. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties.\n \nNote 15 \nLegal Proceedings and Contingencies \n                \nAbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $\n2.5\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and $\n2.0\n billion as of December 31, 2023. For litigation matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, beyond the amounts accrued. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSubject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters.\nAntitrust Litigation\nLawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of \nsix\n individual plaintiff lawsuits and a certified class action by Niaspan direct purchasers. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated \n95 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \npre-trial proceedings under the federal multi-district litigation (MDL) Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2460. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees.\nIn November 2022, the State of Oregon filed a lawsuit in the Multnomah County, Oregon Circuit Court, alleging that 2011 patent litigation by Abbott with a generic company regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlement of that litigation violated state antitrust law. Oregon also brought a claim under the Oregon False Claims Act, which the court dismissed on October 31, 2024.\n \nIn November 2024, the parties reached an agreement in principle to resolve this lawsuit.\nGovernment Proceedings\nLawsuits are pending against Allergan and several other manufacturers generally alleging that they improperly promoted and sold prescription opioid products. Approximately \n435\n lawsuits are pending against Allergan in federal and state courts. Most of the federal court lawsuits are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the MDL rules as In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation, MDL No. 2804. Approximately \n35\n of the lawsuits are pending in various state courts. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits, which include states, counties, cities, other municipal entities, Native American tribes, union trust funds and other third-party payors, private hospitals and personal injury claimants, generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. Of these approximately \n435\n lawsuits, approximately \n25\n of them are brought by states, counties, cities, and other municipal entities, approximately \n5\n of which are in the process of being dismissed pursuant to the previously announced settlement. Another approximately \n45\n of the approximately \n435\n lawsuits are covered by a proposed class settlement between Allergan and a class of acute care hospitals, which is subject to court approval and other contingencies.\nIn March 2023, AbbVie Inc. filed a petition in the United States Tax Court, AbbVie Inc. and Subsidiaries v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The petition disputes the Internal Revenue Service determination concerning a $\n572\n million income tax benefit recorded in 2014 related to a payment made to a third party for the termination of a proposed business combination.\nShareholder and Securities Litigation\nIn October 2018, a federal securities lawsuit, Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2018 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a class.\nIn May and July 2022, two shareholder derivative lawsuits, Treppel Family Trust v. Gonzalez et al., and Katcher v. Gonzalez, et al., were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that certain AbbVie directors and officers breached fiduciary and other legal duties in making or allowing alleged misstatements regarding the potential effect that safety information about another company’s product would have on the Food and Drug Administration’s approval and labeling for AbbVie’s Rinvoq. In October 2024, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss without prejudice. In November 2024, the dismissal was converted to one with prejudice.\nProduct Liability and General Litigation\nIn April 2023, a putative class action lawsuit, Camargo v. AbbVie Inc., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of Humira patients who paid for Humira based on its list price or who, after losing insurance coverage, discontinued Humira because they could not pay based on its list price, alleging that Humira’s list price is excessive in violation of multiple states’ unfair and deceptive trade practices statutes. The plaintiff generally seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees.\nIn 2018, a qui tam lawsuit, U.S. ex rel. Silbersher v. Allergan Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against several Allergan entities and others, alleging that their conduct before the U.S. Patent Office resulted in false claims for payment being made to federal and state healthcare payors for Namenda XR and Namzaric. The plaintiff-relator sought damages and attorneys' fees under the federal False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit. In March 2023, the court granted Allergan’s motion to dismiss, dismissing plaintiff-relator’s federal law claims with prejudice and state law claims without prejudice. The plaintiff-relator is appealing the court’s motion to dismiss ruling.\nLawsuits are pending against various Allergan entities in the United States and other countries including Brazil, Canada, South Korea, and the Netherlands, in which plaintiffs generally allege that they developed, or may develop, breast implant-\n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n96\n                                                         \nassociated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) or other injuries from Allergan’s Biocell® textured breast implants, which were voluntarily withdrawn from worldwide markets in 2019. Approximately \n135\n ALCL lawsuits and \n1,100\n other lawsuits are coordinated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey under the MDL rules as In re: Allergan Biocell Textured Breast Implant Product Liability Litigation, MDL No. 2921. Approximately \n75\n ALCL lawsuits and \n460\n other lawsuits are pending in various state courts. Approximately \n60\n ALCL and \n1,000\n other lawsuits are pending in other countries. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, medical monitoring, and attorneys’ fees.\nIn January 2025, a putative class action lawsuit, Sheet Metal Workers’ Health Plan of Southern California, Arizona, and Nevada v. AbbVie Inc., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of third-party payors of Humira, alleging that AbbVie’s rebating practices are impairing biosimilar competition with Humira in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. The plaintiff generally seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees.\nIntellectual Property Litigation\nAbbVie Inc. is seeking to enforce patent rights relating to upadacitinib (a drug sold under the trademark Rinvoq). Litigation was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in November 2023 against Hetero USA, Inc., Hetero Labs Limited, Hetero Labs Limited Unit-V, Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., Sandoz, Inc., Sandoz Private Limited, Sandoz GMBH, and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. AbbVie alleges defendants’ proposed generic upadacitinib products infringe certain patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.\nAbbVie Inc. is seeking to enforce patent rights related to ubrogepant (a drug sold under the trademark Ubrelvy). Litigation was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in March 2024 against Aurobindo Pharma U.S.A., Inc., Aurobindo Pharma Limited, and Apitoria Pharma Private Limited; Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. and Zydus Lifesciences Limited; MSN Pharmaceuticals Inc., MSN Laboratories Private Limited, and MSN Life Sciences Private Limited; and Hetero USA Inc., Hetero Labs Limited Unit-III, and Hetero Labs Limited. AbbVie alleges defendants’ proposed generic ubrogepant products infringe certain patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, which exclusively licenses certain patents to AbbVie, is a co-plaintiff in the litigation.\nNote 16 \nSegment and Geographic Area Information\nAbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.\nThe CODM regularly reviews net revenues, net earnings and significant segment expenses and uses net earnings as its principal measure of segment profit or loss. Net earnings and significant segment expenses reviewed by CODM are reported on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The CODM uses net earnings as its principal measure of segment profit or loss to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. The CODM does not use segment assets to make decisions regarding resources; therefore, the total asset disclosure has not been included.\n97 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nSubstantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product net revenues in the United States are to three wholesalers.

Directors of AbbVie Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial\n \nstatements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n101 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nSales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Revenue Recognition,” the Company established provisions for sales rebates in the same period the related product is sold. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $\n14,304\n million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates accrued for pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish the rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based on estimates and assumptions, including the determination of the related payer of the rebate based on sales trends, changes in rebate contracts which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms, and the corresponding lag in payment timing.\nAuditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs, contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. Specifically, we tested management’s controls to evaluate the sufficiency of its reserve estimates by comparing to actual rebates paid, controls over rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete and accurate.\nTo test the sales rebate accruals and assess the historical accuracy of management's estimate for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs, our audit procedures included independently calculating the sales rebate accruals based on historical payments and performing a hindsight analysis on the reserves recorded. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroborating management's estimate of the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions considering industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company’s calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy. \n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n102\n                                                         \nValuation of contingent consideration\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Business Combinations” and in Note 11 under the caption “Fair Value Measures,” the Company recognized contingent consideration liabilities at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date in connection with applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recorded within the consolidated statement of earnings in the period of change. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $\n21,666\n million in contingent consideration liabilities, which represented a ‘Level 3’ fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value and the use of management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the liabilities.\nAuditing the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities was complex and required significant auditor judgment due to the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model and the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to estimate the fair value of contingent royalty payments. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to the significant assumptions underlying the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Management utilized its expertise within the industry, including commercial dynamics, trends and utilization, to determine certain of these assumptions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s contingent consideration liabilities process including, among others, management’s process to establish the significant assumptions and measure the liability. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the determination of fair value. The testing was inclusive of key management review controls to monitor estimated future sales, and to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources.\nTo test the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed agreement, assessing the Monte Carlo simulation model used and testing the key contractual inputs and significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the assumptions and judgments considering observable industry and economic trends, and external data sources. Estimated amounts of future sales were also evaluated for reasonableness. Our procedures included evaluating the data sources used by management in determining its assumptions and, where necessary, included an evaluation of available information that either corroborated or contradicted management’s conclusions. We involved a valuation specialist to assess the Company’s Monte Carlo simulation model and to perform corroborative fair value calculations.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 14, 2025 \n103 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n        Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\n    The Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Michael, and the Chief Financial Officer, Scott T. Reents, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n        Changes in internal control over financial reporting. \n   There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024.\n        Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls.\n    AbbVie's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.\nThe design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n        Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting.\n    Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in \nInternal Control-Integrated Framework\n (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nThe effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\nReport of independent registered public accounting firm. \nThe report of AbbVie's independent registered public accounting firm related to its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is included below.\n2024 Form 10-K\n   |  \n104\n                                                         \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AbbVie Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 14, 2025 \n105 \n \n \n|\n  \n2024 Form 10-K\n                                                         \nITEM 9B. \nOTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, no director or officer of the company \nadopted\n, modified or \nterminated\n a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, except as provided below.\nName & Title\nAction Taken\nDate Adopted\nType of Trading Arrangement \n(1)\nAggregate Number of Shares to be  Sold Pursuant to Trading Arrangement \n(2)\nDuration of Trading Arrangement\n(3)\nPerry C.
