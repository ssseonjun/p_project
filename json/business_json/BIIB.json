Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n included in this report.\n78\nTable o\nf\n Contents\nLIQUIDITY\nWORKING CAPITAL\nWorking capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Our working capital was $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared to $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. The change in working capital reflects an increase in total current assets of approximately $597.5 million and an increase in total current liabilities of approximately $2.1 billion. The changes in total current assets and total current liabilities were primarily driven by the following:\nCURRENT ASSETS\n•\n$1.3 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents\n;\n•\n$259.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, net related to our ongoing operations; and\n•\n$429.5 million decrease in other current assets primarily due to the receipt of \n$437.5 million from Samsung BioLogics related to the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis.\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\n•\n$184.1 million increase in accrued expense and other primarily due to $279.3 million of short-term contingent consideration recognized from our acquisition of HI-Bio, offset in part by the timing of our annual incentive compensation payment and other benefits-related payments; and\n•\n$1.6 billion increase in current portion of debt primarily due to the reclassification of our $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.05% Senior Notes due September 15, 2025, from long-term to short-term and the repayment of our 2023 Term Loan.\nFor additional information on our acquisition of HI-Bio, please read \nNote 2, Acquisitions\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. For additional information on the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis and the sale of our PRV, please read \nNote 3, Dispositions\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. For additional information on our 2023 Term Loan, please read \nNote 13, Indebtedness\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $2.4 billion compared to approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the balance was primarily due to cash generated by our operations, the receipt of $437.5 million in April 2024 from Samsung BioLogics related to the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, the net cash receipt of $88.6 million from the sale of one of our two PRV's and proceeds from the sale of a portion of our Denali common stock and our remaining Sangamo common stock during 2024. The increase was offset in part by $1.15 billion of cash and cash equivalents used to fund our acquisition of HI-Bio in July 2024 and $650.0 million of cash used for the repayment of our 2023 Term Loan.\nUntil required for another use in our business, we typically invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. and foreign government instruments, overnight reverse repurchase agreements and other interest-bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. It is our policy to mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves and marketable securities by maintaining a well-diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure as to institution, maturity and investment type. We have experienced no significant limitations in our liquidity resulting from uncertainties in the banking sector.\n79\nTable o\nf\n Contents\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of our significant common stock investments in our strategic investment portfolio:\nAs of December 31, \n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nDenali\n(1)\n$\n145.8 \n$\n273.6 \nSage\n33.9 \n135.3 \nSangamo\n(1)\n— \n7.9 \nTotal\n$\n179.7 \n$\n416.8 \n(1) \nDuring 2024 we sold a portion of our Denali common stock and the remaining shares of our Sangamo common stock.\nOur ability to liquidate our investments in Denali and Sage may be limited by the size of our interest, the volume of market related activity, our concentrated level of ownership and potential restrictions resulting from our status as a collaborator. Therefore, we may realize significantly less than the current value of such investments.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, \nto our consolidated financial statements included in this report\n.\nCASH FLOW\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity:\n% Change\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024 \nvs.\n2023\n2023\nvs.\n2022\n(In millions, except percentages)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n2,875.5 \n$\n1,547.2 \n$\n1,384.3 \n85.9 \n%\n11.8 \n%\nNet cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities\n(799.2)\n(4,101.0)\n1,576.6 \n(80.5)\n(360.1)\nNet cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities\n(683.5)\n149.3 \n(1,747.3)\n(557.8)\n108.5 \nOPERATING ACTIVITIES\nOperating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for:\n•\nnon-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, unrealized (gain) loss on strategic investments and share-based compensation;\n•\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations; and\n•\n(gains) losses on the disposal of assets, deferred income taxes, changes in the fair value of contingent payments associated with our acquisitions of businesses and acquired IPR&D.\nFor 2024 compared to 2023, the increase in net cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income, lower employee-benefit payments made during the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, lower estimated federal tax payments made during 2024, as compared to 2023, and changes in non-cash adjustments to net income. The increase was partially offset by the timing of working capital, which includes higher inventory levels, primarily associated with our contract manufacturing for LEQEMBI.\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES\nFor 2024 compared to 2023, the change in net cash flow in investing activities was primarily due to cash payments made associated with our acquisition of HI-Bio in 2024 and with our acquisition of Reata in 2023. Additionally, cash outlay in 2023 was partially offset by net proceeds received from the sale of our marketable securities. \nFINANCING ACTIVITIES\nFor 2024 compared to 2023, the change in net cash flow in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of our 2023 Term Loan for $650.0 million during 2024 compared to the issuance of term loans totaling $1.0 billion under our 2023 Term Loan which were used to partially fund our acquisition of Reata in 2023, partially offset by repayments of borrowings and debt premiums paid in 2023 totaling $809.9 million.\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read \nNote 2, Acquisitions\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n80\nTable o\nf\n Contents\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nDEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES\nLONG-TERM DEBT AND TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENTS\nOur long-term obligations primarily consist of long-term debt related to our Senior Notes with final maturity dates ranging between 2030 and 2051. As of December 31, 2024, our outstanding balance related to long-term debt was $4,547.2 million.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we entered into a $1.5 billion term loan credit agreement. On the closing date of the Reata acquisition we drew $1.0 billion from the 2023 Term Loan, comprised of a $500.0 million floating rate 364-day tranche and a $500.0 million floating rate three-year tranche. The remaining unused commitment of $500.0 million was terminated. As of December 31, 2023, we repaid $350.0 million of the 364-day tranche. The remaining $150.0 million portion of the 364-day tranche was repaid during the first quarter of 2024.\nAdditionally, during the first quarter of 2024 we repaid $250.0 million of the three-year tranche, with the remaining $250.0 million portion being subsequently repaid in full during the second quarter of 2024.\n2024 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\nIn August 2024 we entered into a $1.5 billion, five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we are permitted to draw funds for working capital and general corporate purposes. The terms of the revolving credit facility include a financial covenant that requires us not to exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. This revolving credit facility replaced the revolving credit facility that we entered into in January 2020. As of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings and were in compliance with all covenants under this facility.\nFor a summary of the fair values of our outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, please read \nNote 8, Fair Value Measurements,\n to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nFor additional information on our Senior Notes, 2023 Term Loan and credit facility please read, \nNote 13, Indebtedness\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nSHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\nIn October 2020 our Board of Directors authorized our 2020 Share Repurchase Program, which is a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock. Our 2020 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. All shares repurchased under our 2020 Share Repurc\nhase Program were retired. There were no share repurchases of our common stock during the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023. \nApproximately \n$2.1 billion\n remained available under our 2020 Share Repurchase Program as of \nDecember 31, 2024.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021 we began construction of a new gene therapy, clinical packaging and other manufacturing facility in RTP, North Carolina to support our gene therapy pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas. The new manufacturing facility will be approximately 197,000 square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $195.0 million. We estimate the construction of this manufacturing facility will be completed during 2025. As we continue to advance our research and development prioritization efforts, which includes refocusing our investment in gene therapy, we are evaluating several alternative uses for this facility.\n81\nTable o\nf\n Contents\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024, excluding amounts related to uncertain tax positions, funding commitments, contingent development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, contingent payments and contingent consideration related to our business combinations, as described below.\n \nPayments Due by Period\n(In millions)\nTotal\nLess than\n1 Year\n1 to 3\nYears\n3 to 5\nYears\nAfter\n5 Years\nNon-cancelable operating leases \n(1)(2)(3)\n$\n459.6 \n$\n88.7 \n$\n152.5 \n$\n66.0 \n$\n152.4 \nLong-term debt obligations \n(4)\n9,797.0 \n1,965.0 \n323.7 \n323.7 \n7,184.6 \nPurchase and other obligations \n(5)\n566.7 \n406.2 \n135.3 \n20.7 \n4.5 \nDefined benefit obligation\n107.1 \n— \n— \n— \n107.1 \nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n10,930.4 \n$\n2,459.9 \n$\n611.5 \n$\n410.4 \n$\n7,448.6 \n(1)\n We lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. Amounts reflected within the table above detail future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31 for each of the periods presented. In addition to the minimum rental commitments, these leases may require us to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expense. \n(2)\n Obligations are presented net of sublease income expected to be received for our vacated portions of our Weston, Massachusetts facility and other facilities throughout the world.\n(3)\n In connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we assumed operating lease commitments, including the responsibility for a single-tenant, built-to-suit building with a total net present value of rental expense of approximately $154.4 million over the next 15 years. For additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read \nNote 2, Acquisitions\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n(4)\n Long-term debt obligations are related to our 2021 Exchange Offer Senior Notes, our 2020 Senior Notes and our 2015 Senior Notes, including principal and interest payments. For additional information on our long-term debt obligations, please read \nNote 13, Indebtedness\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n(5)\n Purchase and other obligations include $234.0 million related to the remaining payments on the Transition Toll Tax and $11.7 million related to the fair value of net liabilities on derivative contracts.\nROYALTY PAYMENTS\nTYSABRI\nWe are obligated to make contingent payments of 18.0% on annual worldwide net sales of TYSABRI up to $2.0 billion and 25.0% on annual worldwide net sales of TYSABRI that exceed $2.0 billion. Royalty payments are recognized as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income.\nSPINRAZA\nWe make royalty payments to Ionis on annual worldwide net sales of SPINRAZA using a tiered royalty rate between 11.0% and 15.0%, which are recognized as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Ionis, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nQALSODY\nWe make royalty payments to Ionis on annual worldwide net sales of QALSODY using a tiered royalty rate between 11.0% and 15.0%, which are recognized as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Ionis, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nVUMERITY\nWe make royalty payments to Alkermes on worldwide net sales of VUMERITY using a royalty rate of 15.0%, which are recognized as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Royalties payable on net sales of VUMERITY are subject, under certain circumstances, to tiered minimum annual payment requirements for a period of five years following FDA approval.\nIn October 2019 we entered into a new supply agreement and amended our license and collaboration agreement with Alkermes for VUMERITY. We have elected to initiate a technology transfer and, following a transition period, to \n82\nTable o\nf\n Contents\nmanufacture VUMERITY or have VUMERITY manufactured by a third party we have engaged in exchange for paying an increased royalty rate to Alkermes on any portion of future worldwide net commercial sales of VUMERITY that is manufactured by us or our designee.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangement with Alkermes, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nSKYCLARYS\nIn connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we assumed additional contractual obligations related to royalty payments. Reata entered into agreements to pay royalties on future sales of SKYCLARYS, which will cumulatively range in the low- to mid-single digits.\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read \nNote 2, Acquisitions\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nIn connection with our acquisition of HI-Bio in July 2024 we may make additional payments based upon the achievement of certain milestone events. We recognized the contingent consideration obligations associated with this acquisition at its fair value on the acquisition date and we revalue this obligation each reporting period. We may pay up to an additional \n$650.0 million\n \nin potential future development and regulatory milestone payments.\n The acquisition-date fair value of these milestones was approximately $485.1 million. We anticipate that we may trigger the first and second milestone payments of approximately $150.0 million each in 2025.\nFor additional information on our acquisition of HI-Bio, please read \nNote 2, Acquisitions\n, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCONTINGENT DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY AND COMMERCIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS\nBased on our development plans as of December 31, 2024, we could trigger potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately $3.8 billion, including approximately $0.5 billion in development milestones, approximately $0.5 billion in regulatory milestones and approximately $2.8 billion in commercial milestones, as part of our various collaborations, including licensing and development programs and HI-Bio's pre-existing commitments, as discussed below. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones was not considered probable as of December 31, 2024, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones.\nIf certain clinical and commercial milestones are met, we may pay up to approximately $73.6 million in milestones in 2025 under our current agreements, excluding opt-in payments. \nWe acquired HI-Bio's pre-existing in-license commitments under third-party agreements, which include tiered royalties on potential future sales of felzartamab and izastobart/HIB210, ranging from high-single digit to mid-teen percentages, as well as potential future development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments related to felzartamab and izastobart/HIB210 of up to $130.0 million, $230.0 million and $640.0 million, respectively. This amount includes potential milestone payments due upon the first patient dosed in a phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab in a first and second indication of $35.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively, which we anticipate will be triggered in 2025.\nOTHER FUNDING COMMITMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have several ongoing clinical studies in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The contracts with CROs are generally cancellable, with notice, at our option. We recorded accrued expense of approximately $21.7 million in our consolidated balance sheets for expenditures incurred by CROs as of December 31, 2024. We have approximately $509.2 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts as of December 31, 2024.\nTAX RELATED OBLIGATIONS\nWe exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2024, we have approximately $173.8 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.\n83\nTable o\nf\n Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have accrued income tax liabilities of approximately $234.0 million and $419.5 million, respectively, under the Transition Toll Tax. The amount accrued as of December 31, 2024, is expected to be paid within one year. The Transition Toll Tax is being paid in installments over an eight--year period, which started in 2018, and will not accrue interest.\nOTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We consolidate variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nFor a discussion of new accounting standards  please read \nNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\n to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nLEGAL MATTERS\nFor a discussion of legal matters as of December 31, 2024, please read \nNote 21, Litigation,\n to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Other significant accounting policies are outlined in \nNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. \nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nWe recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue following the five-step model prescribed under FASB ASC 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations.\nPRODUCT REVENUE\nIn the U.S., we sell our products primarily to wholesale and specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies. In other countries, we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors, hospitals, pharmacies and other third-party distribution partners. These customers subsequently resell our products to health care providers and patients. In addition, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payors that provide for government-mandated or privately-negotiated discounts and allowances related to our products.\nProduct revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\nRESERVES FOR DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES\nProduct revenue is recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with our customers, health care providers or payors, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of the international markets in which we operate. Our process for \n84\nTable o\nf\n Contents\nestimating reserves established for these variable consideration components do not differ materially from our historical practices.\nProduct revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenue, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns.\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). Our estimates of reserves established for variable consideration are calculated based upon a consistent application of our methodology utilizing the expected value method. These estimates reflect our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The transaction price, which includes variable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, a 10.0% change in our discounts, contractual adjustments and reserves would have resulted in a decrease of our pre-tax earnings by approximately $351.9 million and $345.5 million, respectively.\nIn addition to discounts, rebates and product returns, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally reflected as a reduction of revenue. To the extent we can demonstrate a separable benefit and fair value for these services we classify these payments in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nFor additional information on our revenue, please read \nNote 5, Revenue\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IPR&D\nWhen we purchase a business, the acquired IPR&D is measured at fair value, capitalized as an intangible asset and tested for impairment at least annually, as of October 31, until commercialization, after which time the IPR&D is amortized over its estimated useful life. If we acquire an asset or group of assets that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting standards, then the acquired IPR&D is expensed on its acquisition date. Future costs to develop these assets are recorded to research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income as they are incurred.\nWe have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets through the acquisition of biotechnology companies or through the consolidation of variable interest entities. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products, IPR&D product candidates and priority review vouchers. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, we generally engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:\n•\nestimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in-process projects;\n•\nprojecting regulatory approvals;\n•\nestimating future cash flow from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; and\n•\ndeveloping appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project.\nWe believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates.\nIf these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods. Additionally, the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated.\n85\nTable o\nf\n Contents\nINVENTORY\nAt each reporting period we review our inventories for excess or obsolescence and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about the future demand of our products, product expiration dates, estimated future sales and our general future plans. If customer demand subsequently differs from our forecasts, we may be required to record additional charges for excess inventory.\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions we use in estimating inventory write-downs are reasonable, no assurance can be given that significant future changes in these assumptions or changes in future events and market conditions could result in different estimates.\nIMPAIRMENT AND AMORTIZATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nLong-lived assets to be held and used include property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets, including IPR&D and trademarks. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We review our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nWhen performing our impairment assessment, we calculate the fair value using the same methodology as described above under \nAcquired Intangible Assets, including IPR&D\n. If the carrying value of our acquired IPR&D exceeds its fair value, then the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our acquired IPR&D could result in an impairment. Impairments are recorded within amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets in our consolidated statements of income.\nBased on our most recent impairment assessment we incurred impairment charges of approximately $60.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, related to the impairment of other clinical programs we acquired from Reata and Samsung Bioepis commercialization rights terminated during the third quarter of 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had no impairment charges. For additional information on our impairments, please read \nNote 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOur most significant intangible assets relate to SKYCLARYS and TYSABRI. We amortize the intangible assets related to our marketed products using the economic consumption method, which is based on revenue generated from the products underlying the related intangible assets. An analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of our marketed products is performed annually during our long-range planning cycle and whenever events or changes in circumstances would significantly affect anticipated lifetime revenue of the relevant products.\nFor additional information on the impairment charges related to our long-lived assets during 2024, 2023 and 2022, please read \nNote 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill,\n to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCONTINGENT CONSIDERATION\nWe record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue the remaining obligations and record changes in the fair value as an adjustment to (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration in our consolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates, changes in the amount or timing of expected expenditures associated with product development, changes in the amount or timing of cash flow and reserves associated with products upon commercialization, changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any cumulative sales-based and development milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. These fair value measurements represent Level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market.\nSignificant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, changes in assumptions described above, could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.\nINCOME TAXES\nWe prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in \n86\nTable o\nf\n Contents\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon our election in the fourth quarter of 2018 to record deferred taxes for GILTI, we have included amounts related to GILTI taxes within temporary difference.\nSignificant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions using a “more likely than not” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. We adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished, through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “more likely than not” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. We consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews, we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re-examine the related tax position. We also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax (benefit) expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nBusiness combinations are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. The results of operations of the acquired company are included in our results of operations beginning on the acquisition date, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. Any excess of consideration transferred over the net carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date is recognized as goodwill.\nWe use the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a form of the income approach, utilizing post-tax cash flow and discount rates in estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired when allocating the purchase consideration paid for the acquisition. The estimates of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets involve significant judgment by management and include assumptions with measurement uncertainty, such as the amount and timing of projected cash flow, long-term sales forecasts, discount rates and additionally for IPR&D intangible assets, the timing and probability of regulatory and commercial success.\nWe use the net realizable value method in estimating the fair value of acquired finished goods and work-in-process inventory. Raw materials acquired are valued using the replacement cost method.\nTransaction and restructuring costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. If we determine the assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination.\nITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are subject to certain risks that may affect our results of operations, cash flow and fair values of assets and liabilities, including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate movements and equity price exposure as well as changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the military conflict in the Middle East. We manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates through various financial instruments, including derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate lock contracts and interest rate swap contracts. \n87\nTable o\nf\n Contents\nWe do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions, and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK\nOur results of operations are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. As a result, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flow can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc.\nWhile the financial results of our global activities are reported in U.S. dollars, the functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency. Fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in ways that are difficult to predict. In particular, as the U.S. dollar strengthens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue will decline when reported in U.S. dollars. The impact to net income as a result of a strengthening U.S. dollar will be partially mitigated by the value of non-U.S. expense, which will also decline when reported in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue and expense will increase when reported in U.S. dollars.\nWe have established revenue and operating expense hedging and balance sheet risk management programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flow and changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018 the International Practices Task Force of the Center for Audit Quality categorized Argentina as a country with a projected three-year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100.0%, which indicated that Argentina’s economy is highly inflationary. This categorization did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position as of December 31, 2024, and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position in the future. In December 2023 the Argentinian Peso experienced a substantial devaluation following a presidential election. The devaluation resulted in a $16.0 million charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 in other (income) expense, net within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nREVENUE AND OPERATING EXPENSE HEDGING PROGRAM\nOur foreign currency hedging program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact resulting from volatility in exchange rate changes on revenue and operating expense. We use foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to manage foreign currency risk, with the majority of our forward contracts and options used to hedge certain forecasted revenue and operating expense transactions denominated in foreign currencies in the next 12 months. We do not engage in currency speculation. For a more detailed disclosure of our revenue and operating expense hedging program, please read \nNote 10, Derivative Instruments,\n to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.  \nOur ability to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenue and net income diminishes as significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are sustained over extended periods of time. In particular, devaluation or significant deterioration of foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to mitigate and likely to negatively impact earnings. The cash flow from these contracts are reported as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flow.\nBALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT HEDGING PROGRAM\nWe also use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certain balance sheet items. The primary objective of our balance sheet risk management program is to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency denominated net monetary assets and liabilities of foreign affiliates. In these instances, we principally utilize currency forward contracts. We have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items. The cash flow from these contracts are reported as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flow.\nThe following quantitative information includes the impact of currency movements on forward contracts used in our revenue, operating expense and balance sheet hedging programs. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, a hypothetical adverse 10.0% movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar across all maturities would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately $191.7 million and $249.4 million, respectively. The estimated fair value change was determined by measuring the impact of the hypothetical exchange rate movement on outstanding forward contracts. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments is subject to assumptions and actual impact could be significantly \n88\nTable o\nf\n Contents\ndifferent. The quantitative information about market risk is limited because it does not take into account all foreign currency operating transactions.\nCREDIT RISK\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives and accounts receivable. We attempt to minimize the risks related to cash and cash equivalents and investments by investing in a broad and diverse range of financial instruments. We have established guidelines related to credit ratings and maturities intended to safeguard principal balances and maintain liquidity. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. We minimize credit risk resulting from derivative instruments by choosing only highly rated financial institutions as counterparties.\nWe operate in certain countries where weakness in economic conditions, including the effects of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the military conflict in the Middle East, can result in extended collection periods. We continue to monitor these conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies and the relevant financial markets, and assess their possible impact on our business. To date, we have not experienced any significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable.\nWe believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nEQUITY PRICE RISK\nOur strategic investment portfolio includes investments in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies. While we are holding such securities, we are subject to equity price risk, and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments. We may sell such equity securities based on our business considerations, which may include limiting our price risk.\nChanges in the fair value of these equity securities are impacted by the volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors. The potential change in fair value for equity price sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 10.0% adverse movement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, a hypothetical adverse 10.0% movement would result in a hypothetical decrease in fair value of approximately $18.0 million and $41.7 million, respectively.\nITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nWe have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of December 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that:\n(a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms; and \n89\nTable o\nf\n Contents\n(b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. \nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nMANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a company’s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework.\nBased on our assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included herein.\nITEM 9B.

We have certain business and financial rights with respect to RITUXAN for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, CLL and other conditions; RITUXAN HYCELA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL; GAZYVA for the treatment of CLL and follicular lymphoma; OCREVUS for the treatment of PPMS and RMS; LUNSUMIO for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma; COLUMVI, a bispecific antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and have the option to add other potential anti-CD20 therapies, pursuant to our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group.\nWe commercialize a portfolio of biosimilars of advanced biologics including: BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL; IMRALDI, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA; FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE; and BYOOVIZ, a ranibizumab biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS, in certain international markets, as well as TOFIDENCE, a tocilizumab biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA, in the U.S. and certain international markets. We also have commercialization rights related to OPUVIZ, an aflibercept biosimilar referencing EYLEA. \nOn July 2, 2024, we completed the acquisition of HI-Bio. As a result of this transaction we acquired HI-Bio's lead asset, felzartamab, an anti-CD38 antibody currently being evaluated for three leading indications, AMR, PMN and IgAN. For additional information on our acquisition of HI-Bio, please read \nNote 2, Acquisitions\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect our financial statements, those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. For consolidated entities where we own or are exposed to less than \n100.0\n% of the economics, we record net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective noncontrolling parties. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. \nIn determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, we apply a qualitative approach that determines whether we have both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to that entity. We continuously assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as changes to existing relationships or future transactions may result in us consolidating or deconsolidating one or more of our collaborators or partners. In November 2023 we terminated the Neurimmune Agreement, which resulted in the deconsolidation of our variable interest entity, Neurimmune.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue following the five-step model prescribed under FASB ASC 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations.\nProduct Revenue\nIn the U.S., we sell our products primarily to wholesale and specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies. In other countries, we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors, hospitals, pharmacies and other third-party distribution partners. These customers subsequently resell our products to health care providers and patients. In addition, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payors that provide for government-mandated or privately-negotiated discounts and allowances related to our products.\nProduct revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\nReserves for Discounts and Allowances\nProduct revenue is recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with our customers, health care providers or payors, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of the international markets in which we operate. \nProduct revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenue, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns.\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). Our estimates of reserves established for variable consideration are calculated based upon a consistent application of our methodology utilizing the expected value method. These estimates reflect our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The transaction price, which includes variable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\nDiscounts include trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives and volume related discounts. Trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives primarily relate to estimated obligations for credits to be granted to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within established incentive periods and credits to be granted to wholesalers for compliance with various contractually-defined inventory management practices, respectively. We determine these reserves based on our historical experience, including the timing of customer payments. Volume related discounts primarily relate to incentives offered to downstream customers who earn discounts based upon the quarterly or annual volume of units purchased.\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nContractual adjustments primarily relate to Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S., pharmacy rebates, co-payment (copay) assistance, VA and PHS discounts, specialty pharmacy program fees and other governmental rebates or applicable allowances.\n•\nMedicaid rebates:\n relate to our estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our liability for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make for the current quarter, claims for prior quarters that have been estimated for which an invoice has not been received, invoices received for claims from the prior quarters that have not been paid and an estimate of potential claims that will be made for inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end.\n•\nGovernmental rebates:\n or chargebacks, including VA and PHS discounts, represent our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices we charge to wholesalers which provide those products. The wholesaler charges us for the difference between what the wholesaler pays for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Rebate and chargeback reserves are established in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and a reduction in the net accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider from the wholesaler, and we generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of the wholesaler notifying us about the resale. Our reserves for VA, PHS and other chargebacks consist of amounts for inventory that exists at the wholesalers that we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare providers and chargebacks that wholesalers have claimed for which we have not issued a credit.\n•\nManaged care rebates:\n represent our estimated obligations to third parties, primarily pharmacy benefit managers. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. These rebates result from performance-based goals, formulary position and price increase limit allowances (price protection). The calculation of the accrual for these rebates is based on an estimate of the coverage patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period.\n•\nCopay assistance:\n represents financial assistance to qualified patients, assisting them with prescription drug co-payments required by insurance. The calculation of the accrual for copay is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end.\n•\nPharmacy rebates:\n represent our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to specific pharmacies. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. These rebates result from contracted discounts on product purchased or product dispensed. The calculation of the accrual for these rebates is based on an estimate of the pharmacy’s buying or dispensing patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over the contractual period.\n•\nOther governmental rebates:\n non-U.S. pharmaceutical taxes or applicable allowances primarily relate to mandatory rebates and discounts in international markets where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payors for healthcare.\nProduct return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers and are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product revenue. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Expired product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product.\nIn addition to discounts, rebates and product returns, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally reflected as a reduction of revenue. To the extent we can demonstrate a \nF-10\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nseparable benefit and fair value for these services we classify these payments in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nRevenue from Anti-CD20 Therapeutic Programs\nOur collaboration with Genentech is within the scope of ASC 808, \nCollaborative Agreements\n, which provides guidance on the presentation and disclosure of collaborative arrangements. For purposes of this footnote, we refer to RITUXAN and RITUXAN HYCELA collectively as RITUXAN.\nOur share of the pre-tax co-promotion profits on RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO and royalty revenue on sales of OCREVUS, resulted from an exchange of a license. As we do not have future performance obligations under the license or collaboration agreement, revenue is recognized as the underlying sales occur.\nRevenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs consist of:\n(i)     our share of pre-tax profits and losses in the U.S. for RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO; \n(ii)    royalty revenue on sales of OCREVUS; and\n(ii)     other revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which consists of our share of pre-tax co-promotion profits on RITUXAN in Canada, royalties on net sales of COLUMVI in the U.S. and royalties on sales of LUNSUMIO outside the U.S. \nPre-tax co-promotion profits on RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO are calculated and paid to us by Genentech and the Roche Group. Pre-tax co-promotion profits consist of net sales to third-party customers less applicable costs to manufacture, third-party royalty expense, distribution, selling and marketing expense and joint development expense incurred by Genentech and the Roche Group. Our share of the pre-tax profits on RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO include estimates that are based on information received from Genentech and the Roche Group. These estimates are subject to change and actual results may differ. \nWe recognize royalty revenue on sales of OCREVUS based on our estimates from third party and market research data of OCREVUS sales occurring during the corresponding period. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is generally expected to be the following quarter.\nPrior to regulatory approval, we record our share of the expense incurred by the collaboration for the development of anti-CD20 products within research and development expense and pre-commercialization costs within selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. After an anti-CD20 product is approved, we record our share of the development and sales and marketing expense related to that product as a reduction of our share of pre-tax profits in revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs. \nAccordingly, Biogen recorded its share of the expense incurred in connection with the development of LUNSUMIO within research and development expense and its share of pre-commercialization costs within selling, general and administrative expense through December 2022, when regulatory approval was granted by the FDA. Beginning in January 2023 our share of pre-tax profits and losses in the U.S. for LUNSUMIO was reflected as a component of revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs within our consolidated statements of income.\nFor additional information on our relationship with Genentech, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships,\n to these consolidated financial statements. \nAlzheimer's Collaboration Revenue\nAlzheimer's collaboration revenue consists of our \n50.0\n% share of LEQEMBI product revenue, net and cost of sales, including royalties, as we are not the principal. We began recognizing Alzheimer's collaboration revenue upon the accelerated approval of LEQEMBI in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2023.\nContract Manufacturing, Royalty and Other Revenue\nContract Manufacturing Revenue\nWe record contract manufacturing revenue primarily from amounts earned under contract manufacturing agreements with our strategic customers. Revenue under contract manufacturing agreements is recognized when the customer obtains control of the product, which may occur at a point in time or over time depending on the terms and conditions of the agreement. During the first quarter of 2023 we began recognizing contract manufacturing revenue \nF-11\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nfor LEQEMBI, upon accelerated approval of LEQEMBI in the U.S. Prior to accelerated approval, our share of contract manufacturing amounts related to LEQEMBI were recognized in research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income.\nRoyalty and Other Revenue\nRoyalty and other revenue primarily reflects royalty revenue on biosimilar products from our license arrangements with Samsung Bioepis and royalties we receive from net sales on products related to patents that we have out-licensed.\nAs the royalties we receive relate to arrangements that resulted from an exchange of a license and utilize the sales and usage based royalty exception, the royalties are recognized as the underlying sales occur.\nCollaborative and Other Relationships\nWe also have a number of significant collaborative and other third-party relationships for revenue and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates. Where we are the principal on sales transactions with third parties, we recognize revenue, cost of sales and operating expense on a gross basis in their respective lines in our consolidated statements of income. Where we are not the principal on sales transactions with third parties, our share of the revenue, cost of sales and operating expense is recorded on a net basis as a component of other revenue in our consolidated statements of income.\nOur development and commercialization arrangements with Genentech, Eisai, Sage and Samsung Bioepis represent collaborative arrangements as each party is an active participant in one or more joint operating activities and is exposed to significant risks and rewards of these arrangements. These arrangements resulted from an exchange of a license and utilize the sales and usage based royalty exception, as applicable. Therefore, revenue relating to royalties or profit-sharing amounts received is recognized as the underlying sales occur.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, Eisai, Sage and Samsung Bioepis, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements.\n•\nLevel 1\n — Fair values are determined utilizing quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access;\n•\nLevel 2\n — Fair values are determined by utilizing quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other market observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, foreign currency spot rates and option pricing valuation models; and\n•\nLevel 3\n — Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.\nThe majority of our financial assets have been classified as Level 2, and have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, utilizing third-party pricing services or option pricing valuation models. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches and observable market inputs to determine value. These observable market inputs include reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events.\nWe validate the prices provided by our third-party pricing services by understanding the models used, obtaining market values from other pricing sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances. The option pricing valuation models use assumptions within the model, including the term, stock price volatility, constant maturity risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. After completing our validation procedures, we did not adjust or override any fair value measurements provided by our pricing services as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nOther Assets and Liabilities\nThe carrying amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets for current accounts receivable, due from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expense and other, approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider only those investments that are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash and that mature within three months from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash equivalents were comprised of money market funds with maturities less than three months from the date of purchase.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales and primarily represent amounts due from our wholesale and other third-party distributors, public hospitals, pharmacies and other government entities and have standard payment terms that generally require payment within \n30\n to \n90\n days.\nWe do not adjust our receivables for the effects of a significant financing component at contract inception if we expect to collect the receivables in one year or less from the time of sale.\nWe provide reserves against accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from a customer's inability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged or written-off against the reserve.\nReceivables from Samsung BioLogics\nIn April 2022 we completed the sale of our \n49.9\n%\n equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics, which resulted in a receivable of approximately $\n1.3\n billion in cash to be deferred over \ntwo\n payments. The first deferred payment of $\n812.5\n million was received in April 2023 and the second deferred payment of $\n437.5\n million was received in April 2024. The payments due to us from Samsung BioLogics were recorded at their estimated fair values through the use of risk-adjusted discount rates. \nFor additional information on the accounting for the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, please read \nNote 3, Dispositions\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives and accounts receivable. We attempt to minimize the risks related to cash and cash equivalents and investments by investing in a broad and diverse range of financial instruments as previously defined by us. We have established guidelines related to credit ratings and maturities intended to safeguard principal balances and maintain liquidity. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. We minimize credit risk resulting from derivative instruments by choosing only highly rated financial institutions as counterparties.\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables, which are typically unsecured, are somewhat mitigated due to the wide variety of customers and markets using our products, as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas. We monitor the financial performance and creditworthiness of our customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. We continue to monitor these conditions and assess their possible impact on our business.\n \nMarketable Securities and Other Investments\nMarketable Debt Securities\nAvailable-for-sale marketable debt securities are recorded at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in AOCI in equity, net of related tax effects, unless the security has experienced a credit loss, we have determined that we have the intent to sell the security or we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the security before its expected recovery. Realized gains and losses are reported in other (income) expense, net on a specific identification basis.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023 we sold all of our marketable debt securities and used the proceeds to partially fund our acquisition of Reata.\n \nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read \nNote 2, Acquisitions\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nMarketable Equity Securities and Venture Capital Funds\nOur marketable equity securities are recorded at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income. Our marketable equity securities represent investments in publicly traded equity securities and are included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. \nOur investments in venture capital funds are recorded at net asset value, which approximates fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income. The underlying investments of the venture capital funds in which we invest are in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies and are included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe also invest in equity securities of companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available. These investments are recorded using either the equity method of accounting or the cost minus impairment adjusted for observable price changes, depending on our ownership percentage and other factors that suggest we have significant influence. We monitor these investments to evaluate whether any increase or decline in their value has occurred, based on the implied value of recent company financings, public market prices of comparable companies and general market conditions. These investments are included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nEvaluating Marketable Debt Securities for Other-than-Temporary Impairments\nWhen we hold marketable debt securities, we conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in AOCI.\nFor available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the security’s decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected in earnings as an impairment loss.\nRegardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security.\nEquity Method of Accounting\nIn circumstances where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of a company in which we have an investment, we utilize the equity method of accounting for recording investment activity. In assessing whether we exercise significant influence, we consider the nature and magnitude of our investment, the voting and protective rights we hold, any participation in the governance of the other company and other relevant factors such as the presence of a collaborative or other business relationship. Under the equity method of accounting, we record in our consolidated statements of income our share of income or loss of the other company. If our share of losses exceeds the carrying value of our investment, we will suspend recognizing additional losses and will continue to do so unless we commit to providing additional funding.\n \nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost based on the first-in, first-out method. We classify our inventory costs as long-term when we expect to utilize the inventory beyond our normal operating cycle and include these costs in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Inventory that can be used in either the production of clinical or commercial products is expensed as research and development costs when identified for use in a clinical manufacturing campaign.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nCapitalization of Inventory Costs\nWe capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on management’s judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process, including any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions and other impediments to approval. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or delay commercialization. We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. We expense previously capitalized costs related to pre-approval inventory upon changes in such judgments, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or significant delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies.\nObsolescence and Unmarketable Inventory\nAt each reporting period we review our inventories for excess or obsolescence and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring that we perform throughout the manufacturing process. In the event that certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications, we will record a charge to cost of sales to write-down any unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. In all cases, product inventory is carried at the lower of cost or its estimated net realizable value. Amounts written-down due to unmarketable inventory are charged to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost, subject to reviews for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The cost of normal, recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. The cost for planned major maintenance activities, including the related acquisition or construction of assets, is capitalized if the repair will result in future economic benefits.\nInterest costs incurred during the construction of major capital projects are capitalized until the underlying asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the life of the underlying asset. We also capitalize certain direct and incremental costs associated with the validation effort required for licensing by regulatory agencies of new manufacturing equipment for the production of a commercially approved drug. These costs primarily include direct labor and material and are incurred in preparing the equipment for its intended use. The validation costs are either amortized over the life of the related equipment or expensed as cost of sales when the product produced in the validation process is sold.\nIn addition, we capitalize certain internal use computer software development costs. If the software is an integral part of production assets, these costs are included in machinery and equipment and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software, which generally range from \nthree\n to \nfive years\n.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nWe generally depreciate or amortize the cost of our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are summarized as follows:\nAsset Category\nUseful Lives\nLand\nNot depreciated\nBuildings\n15\n to \n40\n years\nLeasehold Improvements\nLesser of the useful life or the term of the respective lease\nFurniture and Fixtures\n5\n to \n7\n years\nMachinery and Equipment\n5\n to \n20\n years\nComputer Software and Hardware\n3\n to \n5\n years\nWhen we dispose of property, plant and equipment, we remove the associated cost and accumulated depreciation from the related accounts in our consolidated balance sheets and include any resulting gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based upon the present value of lease payments over the lease term. When determining the lease term, we include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\nWe use the implicit rate when readily determinable and use our incremental borrowing rate when the implicit rate is not readily determinable based upon the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined using a secured borrowing rate for the same currency and term as the associated lease.\nThe lease payments used to determine our operating lease assets may include lease incentives, stated rent increases and escalation clauses linked to rates of inflation when determinable and are recognized in our operating lease assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Our lease agreements may include both lease and non-lease components, which we account for as a single lease component when the payments are fixed. Variable payments included in the lease agreement are expensed as incurred. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nOur operating leases are reflected in operating lease assets, accrued expense and other and long-term operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe also have real estate lease agreements which are subleased to third parties. Operating leases for which we are the sublessor are included in accrued expense and other and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our consolidated statements of income.\nFor additional information on our leases, please read \nNote 12, Leases\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nIntangible Assets\nOur intangible assets primarily consist of completed technology (comprising of acquired and in-licensed rights and patents, and developed technology), IPR&D acquired after January 1, 2009, acquired priority review vouchers and trademarks and trade names. Our intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the time of their acquisition and are stated in our consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated amortization and impairments, if applicable.\nIntangible assets related to completed technology are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the economic consumption method if anticipated future revenue can be reasonably estimated. The straight-line method is used when revenue cannot be reasonably estimated. Amortization is recorded within amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets in our consolidated statements of income.\nThe economic consumption method is based on revenue generated from the products underlying the related intangible assets. An analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of our marketed products is performed annually \nF-16\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nduring our long-range planning cycle and whenever events or changes in circumstances would significantly affect anticipated lifetime revenue of the relevant products.\nIntangible assets related to trademarks, trade names, IPR&D prior to commercialization and priority review vouchers are not amortized because they have indefinite lives; however, they are subject to review for impairment. We review our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nAcquired In-process Research and Development\nAcquired IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that have not reached technological feasibility. The value assigned to acquired IPR&D is determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting revenue from the projects and discounting the net cash flow to present value. The revenue and cost projections used to value acquired IPR&D are, as applicable, reduced based on the probability of success of developing a new drug. Additionally, the projections consider the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors. The rates utilized to discount the net cash flow to present value are commensurate with the stage of development of the projects and uncertainties in the economic estimates used in the projections. Upon the acquisition of IPR&D, we complete an assessment of whether our acquisition constitutes the purchase of a single asset or a group of assets. We consider multiple factors in this assessment, including the nature of the technology acquired, the presence or absence of separate cash flow, the development process and stage of completion, quantitative significance and our rationale for entering into the transaction.\nIf we acquire a business as defined under applicable accounting standards, then the acquired IPR&D is capitalized as an intangible asset. If we acquire an asset or group of assets that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting standards, then the acquired IPR&D is expensed on its acquisition date. Future costs to develop these assets are recorded to research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income as they are incurred. \nWhen performing our impairment assessment, we calculate the fair value using the same methodology as described above. If the carrying value of our acquired IPR&D exceeds its fair value, then the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our acquired IPR&D could result in an impairment. Impairments are recorded within amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets in our consolidated statements of income.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.\nWe compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.\n As described in \nNote 25, Segment Information,\n to these consolidated financial statements, we operate as \none\n operating segment, which is our only reporting unit.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets to be held and used, including property, plant and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable.\nDetermination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flow is not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nContingent Consideration\nThe consideration for our acquisitions often includes future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event or events. We record an obligation for such contingent payments at fair value on the acquisition date. We estimate the fair value of contingent consideration obligations through valuation models that incorporate probability-adjusted assumptions related to the achievement of the milestones and thus likelihood of making related payments. We revalue our contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations are recognized in our consolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates, changes in the amount or timing of expected expenditures associated with product development, changes in the amount or timing of cash flow and reserves associated with products upon commercialization, changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any cumulative sales-based and development milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. \nDiscount rates in our valuation models represent a measure of the credit risk associated with settling the liability. The period over which we discount our contingent obligations is based on the current development stage of the product candidates, our specific development plan for that product candidate adjusted for the probability of completing the development step and when the contingent payments would be triggered. In estimating the probability of success, we utilize data regarding similar milestone events from several sources, including industry studies and our own experience. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.\n \nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nCash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized each period in current earnings or AOCI, depending on whether the derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. We classify the cash flow from these instruments in the same category as the cash flow from the hedged items. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe assess at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flow or fair values of the hedged items. We exclude the forward points portion of the derivative instruments used in a hedging transaction from the effectiveness test and record the fair value gain or loss related to this portion each period in our consolidated statements of income in the same line as the underlying hedged item. If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument, and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings.\nNet Investment Derivative Instruments\nDesi\ngnated net investment hedges are recognized as either assets or liabilities, at fair value, in our consolidated balance sheets. We hedge the changes in the spot exchange rate in AOCI and exclude changes to the forward rate and amortize the forward points in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income over the term of the contract. We classify the cash flow from these instruments in the same category as the cash flow from the hedged items.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2022 we no longer held net investment hedges as they were closed with the sale of our \n49.9\n% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis in April 2022. For additional information on the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, please read \nNote 3, Dispositions\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nFor additional information on our derivative instruments and hedging activities, please read \nNote 10, Derivative Instruments\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies\nThe functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. For our non-U.S. subsidiaries that transact in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated at current rates of \nF-18\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nexchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net income and are recorded in AOCI, as a separate component of equity. For subsidiaries where the functional currency of the assets and liabilities differ from the local currency, non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the date assets were acquired while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average foreign currency rates for the period. Translation adjustments of these subsidiaries are included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.\nRoyalty Cost of Sales\nWe make royalty payments to a number of third parties under license or purchase agreements associated with our acquisition of intellectual property. These royalty payments are typically calculated as a percentage (royalty rate) of the sales of our products in a particular year. That royalty rate may remain constant, increase or decrease within each year based on the total amount of sales during the annual period. Each quarterly period, we estimate our total royalty obligation for the full year and recognize the proportional amount as cost of sales based on actual quarterly sales as a percentage of full year estimated sales. For example, if the level of net sales in any calendar year increases the royalty rate within the year, we will record our cost of sales at an even rate over the year, based on the estimated blended royalty rate.\n \nAccounting for Share-Based Compensation\nOur share-based compensation programs grant awards that have included stock options, restricted stock units that vest based on stock performance known as MSUs, time-vested RSUs, performance-vested stock units that settle in stock or cash (PSUs) and shares issued under our ESPP. Compensation expense is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the awards at grant date. We recognize compensation expense for the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Where awards are made with non-substantive vesting periods (for instance, where a portion of the award vests upon retirement eligibility), we estimate and recognize expense based on the period from the grant date to the date the employee becomes retirement eligible.\nThe fair values of our stock option grants are estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The estimated fair values of the stock options are then expensed over the options' vesting periods.\nThe fair values of our MSUs and PSUs that settle in stock and have market-based metrics are estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation. We apply an accelerated attribution method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the applicable service period for these awards. The probability of actual shares expected to be earned is considered in the grant date valuation, therefore the expense is not adjusted to reflect the actual units earned.\nThe fair values of our RSUs are based on the market value of our stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense for RSUs is recognized straight-line over the applicable service period.\nWe apply an accelerated attribution method to recognize share-based compensation expense when accounting for our PSUs that settle in cash, and the fair value of the liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period through expected settlement. Compensation expense associated with PSUs that settle in cash are based upon the stock price and the number of units expected to be earned after assessing the probability that certain performance criteria will be met and the targeted payout level associated with the performance criteria expected to be achieved. Cumulative adjustments are recorded each quarter to reflect changes in the stock price and estimated outcome of the performance-related conditions until the date results are determined and settled. If performance criteria are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense previously recognized to date associated with the awards will be reversed.\nThe fair values of PSUs that settle in stock and do not have market-based metrics are based upon the stock price on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized for the number of units expected to be earned after assessing the probability that certain performance criteria will be met and the targeted payout level associated with the performance criteria expected to be achieved. Cumulative adjustments are recorded each quarter to reflect the estimated outcome of the performance-related conditions until the date results are determined and settled. If \nF-19\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nperformance criteria are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense previously recognized to date associated with the awards will be reversed.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, which include compensation and benefits, facilities and overhead expense, clinical trial expense and fees paid to CROs, clinical supply and manufacturing expense, write-offs of inventory that was previously capitalized in anticipation of product launch and determined to no longer be realizable and other outside expense and upfront fees and milestones paid to third-party collaborators. Research and development expense is expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone payments made to third-party collaborators are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Milestone payments made upon regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Payments we make for research and development services prior to the services being rendered are recorded as prepaid assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are expensed as the services are provided. We also accrue the costs of ongoing clinical trials associated with programs that have been terminated or discontinued for which there is no future economic benefit at the time the decision is made to terminate or discontinue the program.\nFrom time to time, we enter into development agreements in which we share expenses with a collaborative partner. We record payments received from our collaborative partners for their share of the development costs as a reduction of research and development expense, except as discussed in \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships,\n to these consolidated financial statements. Expenses incurred by Genentech in the ongoing development of RITUXAN, GAZYVA, LUNSUMIO and other products for which an initial indication has been approved are not recorded as research and development expense, but rather reduce our share of profits recorded as a component of revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of compensation and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal, information technology and other administrative personnel, outside marketing, advertising and legal expense and other general and administrative costs.\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.\n For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, advertising costs t\notaled \n$\n66.8\n million\n, $\n71.4\n million and $\n54.1\n million, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. We recognize deferred taxes associated with our GILTI tax calculations.\nThe income tax consequences from the intra-entity transfers of inventory within our consolidated group, both current and deferred, are recorded as a prepaid tax or deferred charge and recognized through our consolidated statements of income when the inventory is sold to a third party. The income tax consequences from the intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory and associated changes to deferred taxes are recognized when the transfer occurs.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions using a “more likely than not” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. We also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax (benefit) expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nContingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Loss contingency provisions are recorded if the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated or a range of loss can be determined. These accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable loss. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may change our estimates. Legal costs associated with legal proceedings are expensed when incurred.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing undistributed net income attributable to Biogen Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the treasury method by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. The results of operations of the acquired company are included in our results of operations beginning on the acquisition date, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. Any excess of consideration transferred over the net carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date is recognized as goodwill.\nWe use the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a form of the income approach, utilizing post-tax cash flow and discount rates in estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired when allocating the purchase consideration paid for the acquisition. The estimates of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets involve significant judgment by management and include assumptions with measurement uncertainty, such as the amount and timing of projected cash flow, long-term sales forecasts, discount rates and additionally for IPR&D intangible assets, the timing and probability of regulatory and commercial success.\nWe use the net realizable value method in estimating the fair value of acquired finished goods and work-in-process inventory. Raw materials acquired are valued using the replacement cost method.\nTransaction and restructuring costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. If we determine the assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination.\nF-21\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC.

Additionally, the new rules will require disclosure within the notes to the financial statements of the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions and information on any climate-related targets or goals, subject to certain materiality thresholds. \nPhased-in compliance period beginning with annual reporting for fiscal years as of December 31, 2025.\nIn April 2024 the SEC voluntarily stayed implementation of the new climate-related disclosure requirements pending judicial review. Once the litigation is resolved, and if the rule remains in effect, the SEC will announce a new effective date.\nWe are currently evaluating the potential impact that this new rule may have on our company's disclosures.\nF-22\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 2:\nAcquisitions\nHuman Immunology Biosciences\nOn July 2, 2024, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of HI-Bio, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on targeted therapies for patients with severe immune-mediated diseases. HI-Bio's lead asset, felzartamab, an anti-CD38 antibody, is currently being evaluated for three leading indications, AMR, PMN and IgAN. Felzartamab has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation and ODD from the FDA for development in the treatment of PMN and AMR. Subsequent to our acquisition, felzartamab received ODD in the E.U. in IgAN and solid organ transplantation. The acquisition of HI-Bio is expected to augment our pipeline and build on our expertise in immunology.\nUnder the terms of this acquisition, we paid shareholders of HI-Bio approximately $\n1.15\n billion at closing and may pay up to an additional \n$\n650.0\n million in potential future development and regulatory milestone payments.\n The $\n1.15\n billion paid includes approximately $\n74.5\n million related to HI-Bio's outstanding, non-vested equity awards, inclusive of employer taxes, of which $\n56.4\n million was recognized as share-based compensation payments to settle non-vested equity awards attributable to the post-acquisition service period and therefore not reflected as a component of total purchase price paid. Of the total $\n56.4\n million, we recognized approximately $\n42.5\n million as a charge to research and development expense with the remaining $\n13.9\n million as a charge to selling, general and \nadministrative expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n. \nThese amounts were associated with the accelerated vesting of stock options and RSUs previously granted to HI-Bio employees and required no future services to vest.\nUpon closing we also paid an additional \n$\n43.7\n million related to working capital adjustments as of the transaction close date, which was included as a component of total purchase price paid.\nWe funded this acquisition through available cash on hand and accounted for this acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with\n \nASC Topic 805, Business Combinations\n, and recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date.\nIn addition to the lead program felzartamab, the HI-Bio pipeline acquired includes izastobart/HIB210, an anti-C5aR1 antibody currently in a Phase 1 trial, and the potential for continued development in a range of complement-mediated diseases.\nPurchase Price Consideration\nTotal consideration transferred for the acquisition of HI-Bio is summarized as follows:\n(In millions)\nAs of July 2, 2024\nCash consideration paid to HI-Bio shareholders\n(1)\n$\n1,137.3\n \nContingent consideration\n485.1\n \nTotal consideration\n$\n1,622.4\n \n(1)\n Represents total consideration paid to shareholders of HI-Bio of $\n1.15\n billion, plus an additional $\n43.7\n million related to working capital adjustments as of the transaction close date, less $\n56.4\n million of cash paid for HI-Bio's outstanding, non-vested equity awards, inclusive of employer taxes, which were recognized as compensation attributable to the post-acquisition service period and therefore not reflected as a component of total consideration. \nContingent Consideration:\n We may make certain contingent payments to the former shareholders of HI-Bio upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. As of the acquisition date, the maximum aggregate amount payable for these potential milestones was \n$\n650.0\n million\n. The acquisition-date fair value of these milestones was approximately $\n485.1\n million and was estimated utilizing a probability-adjusted discounted cash flow calculation using an appropriate discount rate dependent on the nature and timing of the milestone payments, which ranged from \n6.2\n% to \n7.0\n%, and \nprobabilities of technological and regulatory success ranging from \n67.0\n% to near-certain probability.\n Of the total contingent consideration, approximately $\n279.3\n million related to milestones classified as short-term and reflected as a component of accrued expense and other with the remaining $\n205.8\n million reflected as a component of other long-term liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets. The short-term liability relates to the fourth patient dosed in a phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab in a first and s\necond indication, which would trigger milestone payments of $\n150.0\n million each.\nF-23\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nSubsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation will be recognized as (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration within our consolidated statements of income. This fair value measurement was based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements. For additional information related to the fair value of this obligation, please read \nNote 8, Fair Value Measurements\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nOther Contractual Commitments: \nWe acquired HI-Bio's pre-existing in-license commitments under third-party agreements, which include tiered royalties on potential future sales of felzartamab and izastobart/HIB210, ranging from high-single digit to mid-teen percentages, as well as potential future development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments related to felzartamab and izastobart/HIB210 of up to $\n130.0\n million, $\n230.0\n million and $\n640.0\n million, respectively. Because the achievement of these milestones was not considered probable as of the transaction close date, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements.\nPreliminary Purchase Price Allocation\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation of the separately identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of July 2, 2024:\n(In millions)\nEstimated Fair Value\nas of\nJuly 2, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n62.5\n \nIntangible assets:\nIPR&D - felzartamab (IgAN)\n920.0\n \nIPR&D - felzartamab (AMR)\n450.0\n \nIPR&D - felzartamab (PMN)\n265.0\n \nOther clinical programs\n7.9\n \nPrepaid expense and other assets\n1.0\n \nOperating lease assets\n1.2\n \nAccounts payable\n(\n1.1\n)\nAccrued liabilities\n(\n35.0\n)\nDeferred tax liability\n(\n304.4\n)\nOperating lease liabilities\n(\n1.2\n)\nTotal identifiable net assets\n1,365.9\n \nGoodwill\n256.5\n \nTotal assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n$\n1,622.4\n \nThere were \nno\n material purchase price allocation adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIntang\nible assets:\n Intangible assets comprised of $\n1.6\n billion of IPR&D related to HI-Bio's lead asset felzartamab. This includes $\n920.0\n million of IPR&D related to felzartamab indication for IgAN, $\n450.0\n million of IPR&D related to felzartamab indication for AMR and $\n265.0\n million of IPR&D related to felzartamab indication for PMN. The estimated fair values of the program related intangible assets were determined using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, utilizing cash flow analyses and a discount rate of \n14.5\n%. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements.\nGoodwill:\n Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acq\nuired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. We recognized goodwill of approximately $\n256.5\n million, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill recognized from our acquisition of HI-Bio is primarily the result of the deferred tax consequences from the transaction recorded for financial statement purposes.\nAcquisition-related expense:\n Acquisition-related expense, primarily comprised\n of advisory and legal fees, and other transaction costs, totaled approximately $\n2.8\n million and were recorded within selling, general and administrative expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024.\nF-24\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nAssumptions in the Allocations of Purchase Price\nT\nhe results of operations of HI-Bio, along with the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the HI-Bio acquisition, have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the closing of the HI-Bio acquisition on July 2, 2024.\nOur preliminary estimate of the fair value of the specifically identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition is subject to the finalization of management's analysis related to certain matters, such as finalizing our assessment of income taxes. The final determination of these fair values will be completed as additional information becomes available but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The final determination may result in asset and liability fair values that are different than the preliminary estimates.\nSubsequent to the acquisition date, our results of operations include the results of operations of HI-Bio. HI-Bio operations had an immaterial impact on our results of operations for the \nyear ended \nDecember 31, 2024. Due to the immateriality of HI-Bio's historic revenue and expenses, additional pro forma information combining the results of operations of Biogen and HI-Bio have not been included.\nReata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nOn September 26, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Reata, a  biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutics that regulate cellular metabolism and inflammation in serious neurologic diseases. As a result of this transaction we acquired SKYCLARYS (omaveloxolone), the first and only drug approved in the U.S. and the E.U. for the treatment of FA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older, as well as other clinical and preclinical pipeline programs. The acquisition of Reata is expected to complement our global portfolio of neuromuscular and rare disease therapies. The addition of SKYCLARYS is anticipated to provide potential operating synergies with SPINRAZA and QALSODY.\nUnder the terms of this acquisition, we paid Reata shareholders $\n172.50\n in cash for each issued and outstanding Reata share, which totaled approximately $\n6.6\n billion. In addition, we agreed to pay approximately $\n983.9\n million in cash for Reata's outstanding equity awards, inclusive of employer taxes, of which approximately $\n590.5\n million was attributable to pre-acquisition services and is therefore reflected as a component of total purchase price paid. Of the $\n983.9\n million paid to Reata's equity award holders, we recognized approximately $\n393.4\n million as compensation attributable to the post-acquisition service period, of which $\n196.4\n million was recognized as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense with the remaining $\n197.0\n million as a charge to research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023. These amounts were associated with the accelerated vesting of stock options and RSUs previously granted to Reata employees that required no future services to vest.\nWe funded this acquisition through available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, supplemented by the issuance of a $\n1.0\n billion term loan under our 2023 Term Loan. For additional information on our 2023 Term Loan, please read \nNote 13, Indebtedness\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nWe accounted for this acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with \nASC Topic 805, Business Combinations\n, and recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. \nPurchase Price Consideration\nTotal consideration transferred for the acquisition of Reata is summarized as follows:\n(In millions)\nAs of September 26, 2023\nCash consideration paid to Reata shareholders\n(1)\n$\n6,602.9\n \nFair value of Reata equity compensation pre-acquisition services and related taxes\n(2)\n590.5\n \nTotal consideration\n$\n7,193.4\n \n(1)\n Represents cash consideration transferred of $\n172.50\n per outstanding Reata ordinary share based on \n38.3\n million Reata shares outstanding at closing.\n(2)\n Represents the fair value of Reata stock options and stock units issued to Reata equity award holders and the related taxes attributable to pre-acquisition vesting services.\nF-25\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nPurchase Price Allocation\nWe finalized purchase accounting for this acquisition in the third quarter of 2024. The following table summarizes the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, and reflects measurement period adjustments made to the amounts initially recorded as of the acquisition date on September 26, 2023. The measurement period adjustments summarized below resulted from updates to our valuation assumptions related to the estimated amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with certain intangible assets, updates of our assumptions related to the quantities, selling location and remaining manufacturing and selling costs of acquired inventory, and other assets and liabilities.\n \nThe related impact to our consolidated statements of income that would have been recognized in previous periods if the adjustments were recognized as of the acquisition date is immaterial.\n(In millions)\nAmounts Recognized as of Acquisition Date\n(as adjusted)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n267.3\n \nAccounts receivable\n15.9\n \nInventory\n1,259.0\n \nOther current assets\n(1)\n54.6\n \nIntangible assets:\nCompleted technology for SKYCLARYS (U.S.)\n4,200.0\n \nIn-process research and development (omaveloxolone)\n2,300.0\n \nPriority review voucher\n100.0\n \nOther clinical programs\n40.0\n \nOperating lease assets\n121.2\n \nAccrued expense and other\n(1)\n(\n110.3\n)\nDebt payable\n(\n159.9\n)\nContingent payable to Blackstone\n(\n300.0\n)\nDeferred tax liability\n(1)\n(\n909.3\n)\nOperating lease liabilities\n(\n151.8\n)\nOther assets and liabilities, net\n(\n2.5\n)\nTotal identifiable net assets\n6,724.2\n \nGoodwill\n(1)\n469.2\n \nTotal assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n$\n7,193.4\n \n(1)\n Includes measurement period adjustments recorded in 2024 that increased other current assets by $\n1.0\n million, accrued expense and other by $\n8.8\n million and goodwill by $\n4.7\n million, and decreased deferred tax liability by $\n3.1\n million.\nInventory:\n Total inventory acquired was\n \napproximately $\n1.3\n billion, which reflects a step-up in the fair value of finished goods and work-in-process inventory for SKYCLARYS. The fair value was determined based on the estimated selling price of the inventory, less the remaining manufacturing and selling costs and a normal profit margin on those manufacturing and selling efforts. This fair value step-up adjustment is being amortized to cost of sales within our consolidated statements of income as the inventory is sold, which is expected to be sold over a period of approximately \n4\n years from the acquisition date. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, amortization from the fair value step-up adjustment was approximately $\n230.0\n million and $\n31.5\n million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024, amortization from the fair value step-up adjustment includes approximately $\n48.5\n million of inventory used for clinical purposes, which is reflected within research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income.\nF-26\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nIntang\nible assets:\n Intangible assets are comprised of $\n4.2\n billion related to SKYCLARYS commercialization rights in the U.S., $\n2.3\n billion of IPR&D related to the omaveloxolone program outside the U.S., which had not yet received regulatory approval in the E.U. as of the acquisition date, $\n100.0\n million related to a rare pediatric disease PRV which may be used to obtain priority review by the FDA for a future regulatory submission or sold to a third party and $\n40.0\n million related to other clinical programs. The estimated fair values of the program related intangible assets were determined using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, utilizing a discount rate of \n14.3\n% and the estimated fair value of the PRV was based on recent external purchase and sale transactions of similar vouchers.\nOur valuation of the SKYCLARYS commercialization rights reflects the assumption that, using an economic consumption model, the related $\n4.2\n billion intangible asset will be amortized over its expected economic life. Upon SKYCLARYS receiving regulatory approval in the E.U. in February 2024, we began selling the product in certain countries in Europe, and began amortizing the $\n2.3\n billion \nIPR&D asset related to the program outside the U.S. over its expected economic life using an economic consumption model.\nThese fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements.\nLeases:\n We assumed responsibility for a single-tenant, build-to-suit building of approximately \n327,400\n square feet of office and laboratory space located in Plano, Texas, with an initial lease term of \n16\n years. We recorded a lease liability of approximately $\n151.8\n million, which represents the net present value of rental expense over the remaining lease term of approximately \n15\n years, with a corresponding right-of-use asset of approximately $\n121.2\n million, which represents our estimate of the fair value for a market participant of the current rental market in the Dallas, Texas area. Included in our estimate of the market rental rate is the value of any leasehold improvements or tenant allowances related to the building. We do not intend to occupy this building and are evaluating opportunities to sublease the property.\nGoodwill:\n Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. We recognized goodwill of approximately $\n469.2\n million, which includes measurement period adjustments, and is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill recognized from our acquisition of Reata is primarily the result of the deferred tax consequences from the transaction recorded for financial statement purposes.\nAcquisition-related expense:\n Acquisition-related expense, primarily comprised of regulatory, advisory and legal fees, and other transaction costs, totaled approximately $\n28.4\n million and were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNote 3:\nDispositions\nSale of Joint Venture Equity Interest in Samsung Bioepis\nIn April 2022 we completed the sale of our \n49.9\n%\n equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics in exchange for total consideration of approximately $\n2.3\n billion. Under the terms of this transaction, we received approximately $\n1.0\n billion in cash at closing, with approximately $\n1.3\n billion in cash to be deferred over \ntwo\n payments. The first deferred payment of $\n812.5\n million was received in April 2023 and the second deferred payment of $\n437.5\n million was received in April 2024. \nPrior to the sale, the carrying value\n of our investment in Samsung Bioepis totaled $\n581.6\n million. \nFor the \nyear\n ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n, we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $\n1.5\n billion related to this transaction, which was recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income. This pre-tax gain included reclassifications from AOCI to net income of approximately $\n58.9\n million in cumulative translation losses, partially offset by approximately $\n57.0\n million in gains resulting from the termination of our net investment hedge.\nWe concluded that the divestment of Samsung Bioepis did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, as our decision to divest this business did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe elected the fair value option and measured the payments due to us from Samsung BioLogics at fair value. As of December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the remaining second deferred payment using a risk-adjusted discount rate of \n5.8\n%\n was approximately \n$\n430.0\n million\n. This payment has been classified as a Level 3 fair value \nF-27\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nmeasurement and is reflected in other current assets within our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a gain of approximately $\n7.5\n million to reflect the change in fair value associated with the passage of time related to the second deferred payment due to us, which was received in April 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized gains of approximately \n$\n13.7\n million\n and \n$\n24.6\n million \nto reflect the changes in fair value associated with changes in interest rates and the passage of time related to the first and second deferred payments due to us, respectively, which were received in April 2023 and April 2024, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of approximately $\n10.7\n million and a loss of approximately $\n1.4\n million to reflect the changes in fair value associated with changes in interest rates and the passage of time related to the first and second deferred payments due to us, respectively, which were received in April 2023 and April 2024, respectively. These changes were recorded in other (income) expense, net within our consolidated statements of income.\nAs part of this transaction, we are also eligible to receive up to an additional $\n50.0\n million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones. Our policy for contingent payments of this nature is to recognize the payments in the period the payments become realizable, which is generally the same period in which the payments are earned.\nAdditionally, for the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a discrete tax expense of approximately $\n257.9\n million related to this transaction, which is reflected in income tax (benefit) expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nSale of Priority Review Voucher\nIn April 2024 we completed the sale of our rare pediatric disease PRV, generated by the development associated with SPINRAZA, to a third party. In consideration for the PRV we received a cash payment of $\n103.0\n million upon the closing of the PRV purchase, of which approximately $\n14.4\n million was paid to Ionis. Our net portion of approximately $\n88.6\n million was recognized in gain on sale of priority review voucher, net within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024.\nNote 4:\nRestructuring\n2023 Fit for Growth Restructuring Program\nIn 2023 we initiated additional cost saving measures as part of our Fit for Growth program to reduce operating costs, while improving operating efficiency and effectiveness. The Fit for Growth program is expected to generate approximately $\n1.0\n billion in gross operating expense savings by the end of 2025, some of which will be reinvested in various initiatives. The Fit for Growth program is currently estimated to include net headcount reductions of approximately \n1,000\n employees and we expect to incur restructuring charges ranging from approximately $\n260.0\n million to $\n280.0\n million.\nTotal charges incurred from our 2023 Fit for Growth program are summarized as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nSeverance Costs\nAccelerated Depreciation and Other Costs\nTotal\nSeverance\nCosts\nAccelerated Depreciation and Other Costs\nTotal\nSelling, general and administrative\n$\n—\n \n$\n13.8\n \n$\n13.8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n23.3\n \n$\n23.3\n \nResearch and development\n—\n \n11.7\n \n11.7\n \n—\n \n1.2\n \n1.2\n \nRestructuring charges\n24.2\n \n—\n \n24.2\n \n153.4\n \n34.6\n \n188.0\n \nTotal charges\n$\n24.2\n \n$\n25.5\n \n$\n49.7\n \n$\n153.4\n \n$\n59.1\n \n$\n212.5\n \nOther Costs:\n includes costs associated with items such as asset abandonment and write-offs, facility closure costs, pretax gains and losses resulting from the termination of certain leases, employee non-severance expense, consulting fees and other costs.\nF-28\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC.

In the second quarter of 2020, the customer received regulatory approval for its product that is being manufactured using certain of our manufacturing-related intellectual property. As a result we were entitled to $\n500.0\n million in a series of \nthree\n payments.

The fair value was determined based on the estimated selling price of the inventory, less the remaining manufacturing and selling costs and a normal profit margin on those manufacturing and selling efforts. This fair value step-up adjustment is being amortized to cost of sales within our consolidated statements of income as the inventory is sold, which is expected to be sold over a period of approximately \n4\n years from the acquisition date. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, amortization from the fair value step-up adjustment was approximately $\n230.0\n million and $\n31.5\n million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024, amortization from the fair value step-up adjustment includes approximately $\n48.5\n million of inventory used for clinical purposes, which is reflected within research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income. For additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read \nNote 2, Acquisitions\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nWrite Downs and Other Charges\nInventory amounts written down as a result of excess, obsolescence or unmarketability are charged to cost of sales, and totaled $\n101.9\n million, $\n124.4\n million and $\n336.2\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022 we wrote-off approximately $\n275.0\n million of inventory related to ADUHELM, as a result of the final NCD, which was recognized in cost of sales within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, was primarily due to amortization for the Reata acquisition acquired intangible assets associated with SKYCLARYS.\nFor the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \namortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $\n40.0\n million impairment charge related to intangible assets from other clinical programs we acquired from Reata, reducing the remaining book value of these IPR&D intangible assets to \nzero\n, and a $\n20.2\n million impairment charge related to intangible assets associated with Samsung Bioepis commercialization rights terminated during the third quarter of 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had \nno\n impairment charges.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $\n119.6\n million impairment charge related to vixotrigine (BIIB074) for the potential treatment of DPN, which was discontinued during the fourth quarter of 2022 based on regulatory, development and commercialization challenges, reducing the remaining book value of this IPR&D intangible asset to zero. We also adjusted the value of our contingent consideration obligations related to this asset resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $\n209.1\n million\n, which was recognized in \n(gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration\n within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended\n December 31, 2022.\nWe monitor events and expectations regarding product performance. If new information indicates that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis are substantially different than those utilized in our current estimates, our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of the relevant products. The occurrence of an adverse event could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense related to our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations, which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations.\nCompleted Technology\nCompleted technology primarily relates to our other marketed products and programs acquired through asset acquisitions, licenses and business combinations. Completed technology intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between \n1\n to \n31\n years, with a remaining weighted average useful life of \n13\n years. In connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we acquired SKYCLARYS, a commercially-approved product in the U.S., with an estimated fair value of approximately $\n4.2\n billion\n, which includes measurement period adjustments. During the first quarter of 2024 SKYCLARYS was approved in the E.U. and became commercially available, which resulted in the reclassification of the related intangible asset, with an estimated fair value of approximately \n$\n2.3\n billion, from IPR&D to completed technology.\nF-35\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC.

During the first quarter of 2024 SKYCLARYS was approved in the E.U. and became commercially available, which resulted in the reclassification of the related intangible asset \nfrom IPR&D to completed technology.\nPriority Review Voucher\nIn connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we acquired a \nrare pediatric disease PRV which may be used to obtain priority review by the FDA for a future regulatory submission or sold to a third party\n.

The value of revenue and operating expense measured in U.S. dollars is therefore subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options with financial institutions with the primary objective to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our international revenue and operating expense.\nForeign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options in effect as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, had durations of \n1\n to \n12\n months. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on the portion of these foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options that are included in the effectiveness test are reported in AOCI. Realized gains and losses of such contracts and options are recognized in revenue when the sale of product in the currency being hedged is recognized and in operating expense when the expense in the currency being hedged is recorded. We recognize all cash flow hedge reclassifications from AOCI and fair value changes of excluded portions in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income that have been impacted by the hedged item.\nThe notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options that were entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and operating expense is summarized as follows:\n \nNotional Amount\nAs of December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nEuro\n$\n1,062.6\n \n$\n1,169.0\n \nBritish pound\n133.8\n \n—\n \nCanadian dollar\n38.6\n \n—\n \nTotal foreign currency forward contracts and options\n$\n1,235.0\n \n$\n1,169.0\n \nThe pre-tax portion of the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options that were included in AOCI in total equity is summarized as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnrealized gains\n$\n50.6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n29.9\n \nUnrealized (losses)\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n34.8\n)\n(\n21.3\n)\nNet unrealized gains (losses)\n$\n50.3\n \n$\n(\n34.8\n)\n$\n8.6\n \nWe expect the net unrealized gains of approximately $\n50.3\n million to be settled over the next \n12\n months, with any amounts in AOCI to be reported as an adjustment to revenue or operating expense. We consider the impact of our and our counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its contractual obligations.

Our investment in the equity of Samsung Bioepis related to this transaction was exposed to the currency fluctuations in the South Korean won. \nIn order to mitigate the currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and South Korean won, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts. These contracts were designated as net investment hedges. In April 2022 we completed the sale of our \n49.9\n% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics and closed these foreign currency forward contracts. Upon completing this sale, the cumulative gains on our net investment hedges of \n$\n57.0\n million were reclassified from AOCI and reflected within the total pre-tax gain recognized from the sale, which was recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

We have not elected hedge accounting for these transactions.\nThe aggregate notional amount of these outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was $\n738.7\n million and $\n1,301.5\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net losses of $\n49.7\n million, net gains of $\n3.8\n million and net losses of $\n34.7\n million related to these contracts were recorded as a component of other (income) expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSummary of Derivative Instruments\nWhile certain of our derivative instruments are subject to netting arrangements with our counterparties, we do not offset derivative assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

This facility includes \n393,000\n square feet related to a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility, \n290,000\n square feet of warehouse, utilities and support space and \n51,000\n square feet of administrative space. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $\n728.8\n million capitalized as construction in progress related to this facility. In the second quarter of 2021 a portion of this facility (the first manufacturing suite) received a GMP multi-product license from SWISSMEDIC and was placed into service. The second manufacturing suite, which was also licensed to operate by SWISSMEDIC, became operational in the first quarter of 2024, resulting in approximately $\n717.3\n million of fixed assets being placed into service.

Awards granted from the 2024 Omnibus Equity Plan may include stock options, shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, stock appreciation rights and other awards in such amounts and with such terms and conditions as may be determined by a committee of our Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of the plan. Shares of common stock available for grant under the 2024 Omnibus Equity Plan consist of \n3.7\n million shares reserved for this purpose, plus shares of common stock that remained available for grant under our 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan (including shares available by reason of a predecessor plan) on the date that our shareholders approved the 2024 Omnibus Equity Plan, plus shares that were subject to awards under the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan (including shares available by reason of a predecessor plan) that remain unissued upon the cancellation, surrender, exchange, termination or forfeiture of such awards. The 2024 Omnibus Equity Plan provides that awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights will be counted against the total number of shares available under the plan in a \n1.5\n-to-1 ratio.\nWe have not made any awards pursuant to the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan or the Directors Plan since our shareholders approved the 2024 Omnibus Equity Plan, and do not intend to make any awards pursuant to the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan or the Directors Plan in the future, except that unused shares under the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan have been carried over for use under the 2024 Omnibus Equity Plan. Awards outstanding under the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan and the Directors Plan as of the date our shareholders approved the 2024 Omnibus Equity Plan will remain outstanding and subject to the terms and conditions of the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan and the Directors Plan, as applicable, and the relevant award agreements.\nStock Options\nIn 2022 we granted approximately \n81,000\n stock options to our CEO (2022 CEO Grant) under the 2017 Omnibus Plan with a grant date fair value of $\n139.10\n per option for a total of approximately $\n11.2\n million. The fair value of the stock option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The estimated fair value of the stock option is then expensed over the options' vesting periods. The 2022 CEO Grant is eligible to vest in equal annual installments over a \nthree-year\n period from the grant date, subject to the CEO’s continued employment.

PSUs awarded to employees have \nthree\n performance periods and vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. The vesting of these awards is subject to the respective employee’s continued employment. The number of PSUs granted represents the target number of units that are eligible to be earned based on the achievement of \nthree\n annual performance measures established when the performance objectives are defined, which will be at the beginning of each year and will end on December 31 of such year. \nParticipants may ultimately earn between \nzero\n and \n200.0\n% of the target number of PSUs granted based on the degree of achievement of the applicable performance metric.

PSUs are classified as liability awards and will be settled in cash based on the \n30\n calendar day average closing stock price through the vesting date, once the actual vested and earned number of PSUs is determined.

The Transition Toll Tax was assessed on our share of our foreign corporations' accumulated foreign earnings that were not previously taxed. Earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have accrued income tax liabilities of $\n234.0\n million and $\n419.5\n million, respectively, under the Transition Toll Tax. The amount accrued as of December 31, 2024, is expected to be paid within one year. The Transition Toll Tax is being paid in installments over an eight--year period, which started in 2018, and will not accrue interest.\nUnremitted Earnings\nAt December 31, 2024, we considered our earnings not to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and therefore recorded deferred tax liabilities associated with an estimate of the total withholding taxes expected as a result of our repatriation of earnings. Other than for earnings, we are permanently reinvested for book/tax basis differences of approximately $\n1.5\n billion as of December 31, 2024, primarily arising through the impacts of purchase accounting. These permanently reinvested basis differences could reverse through sales of the foreign subsidiaries, as well as various other events, none of which were considered probable as of December 31, 2024. The residual U.S. tax liability, if these differences reverse, would be between $\n300.0\n million and $\n400.0\n million as of December 31, 2024.\nF-56\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC.

The net income tax impact of the changes in the valuation allowance was a benefit of approximately $\n56.8\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe change in the valuation allowance between December 31, 2023 and 2022, was primarily driven by a reduction of approximately $\n470.3\n million related to the elimination of Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM as a result of its deconsolidation and reduction of approximately $\n230.3\n million due to movements in net operating loss deferred tax assets in Switzerland. The net income tax impact of the changes in the valuation allowance was an expense of approximately $\n7.4\n million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe change in the valuation allowance between December 31, 2022 and 2021, was primarily driven by an addition of $\n85.0\n million related to Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM. For additional information on the deconsolidation and our collaboration arrangement with Neurimmune, please read \nNote 20, Investments in Variable Interest Entities\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition to deferred tax assets and liabilities, we have recorded deferred charges related to intra-entity sales of inventory.

The provisions of the IRA are effective for periods after December 31, 2022. The IRA did not result in any material adjustments to our income tax provision or income tax balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Further, 2023 benefited from the combined impacts of Reata acquisition-related expenses and the resolution of an uncertain tax matter related to tax credits. This was partially offset by a 2024 benefit related to a decrease in our valuation allowance related to projected future foreign taxable income, as discussed in the Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities section above.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022, the decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by the impact of the non-cash changes in the value of our equity investments, the impact of Fit for Growth related expenses and Reata acquisition-related expenses, as well as the combined net unfavorable tax rate impacts in 2022 related to a litigation settlement agreement, the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, the impact of a Neurimmune valuation allowance, as discussed below, and an international reorganization to align with global tax developments. The change also benefits from the resolution of an uncertain tax matter during the first quarter of 2023 related to tax credits.\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read \nNote 2, Acquisitions\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nFor additional information on the litigation settlement agreement, please read \nNote 18, Other Consolidated Financial Statement Detail\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nNeurimmune Deferred Tax Asset\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, upon issuance of the final NCD related to ADUHELM, we recorded an increase in a valuation allowance of approximately $\n85.0\n million to reduce the net value of a previously recorded deferred tax asset in Switzerland on Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM, the realization of which was dependent on future sales of ADUHELM, to zero.\nF-58\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThis adjustment to our net deferred tax asset was recorded with an equal and offsetting amount assigned to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income, resulting in a zero net impact to net income attributable to Biogen Inc. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023 Neurimmune was deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements. For additional information on the deconsolidation and our collaboration arrangement with Neurimmune, please read \nNote 20, Investments in Variable Interest Entities\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nTax Attributes\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had credit carry forwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes of approximately $\n163.0\n million that begin to expire in 2030 and net operating losses of approximately $\n513.4\n million that do not expire. For U.S. state income tax purposes, we had research and investment credit carry forwards of approximately $\n165.5\n million that begin to expire in 2027 and net operating losses of approximately $\n220.9\n million that begin to expire in 2028. For foreign income tax purposes, we had $\n10.7\n billion of federal net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2027 and $\n10.1\n billion of Swiss cantonal net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2027.\nIn assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we have considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial reporting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and income tax liability and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are utilizable, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the net benefits of the deferred tax assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries, net of the recorded valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust or establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of our unrecognized tax benefits is summarized as follows:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n173.4\n \n$\n606.4\n \n$\n563.4\n \nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current period\n1.2\n \n5.2\n \n36.3\n \nAdditions for tax positions of prior periods\n31.5\n \n60.2\n \n23.4\n \nReductions for tax positions of prior periods\n(\n3.1\n)\n(\n485.0\n)\n(\n14.9\n)\nStatute expirations\n(\n12.7\n)\n(\n2.1\n)\n(\n1.6\n)\nSettlement refund (payment)\n(\n4.0\n)\n(\n11.3\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n186.3\n \n$\n173.4\n \n$\n606.4\n \nAs of December 31, 2022, the unrecognized tax benefits related to a deferred tax asset for Swiss tax purposes for Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM was approximately $\n450.0\n million. This unrecognized tax benefit was recorded as a reduction to the gross deferred tax asset, resulting in the net deferred tax asset, as discussed above, and not as a separate liability on our consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we decreased our gross unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $\n450.0\n million related to this item as a result of the deconsolidation of Neurimmune.\nWe file income tax returns in various U.S. states and in U.S. federal and other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examination for years before 2021 or state, local or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2013.\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other national tax authorities routinely examine our intercompany transfer pricing with respect to intellectual property related transactions and it is possible that they may disagree with one or more positions we have taken with respect to such valuations.\nF-59\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized total interest and penalty expense of $\n13.8\n million, $\n5.1\n million and $\n0.7\n million, respectively. We have accrued $\n40.7\n million and $\n30.2\n million for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIt is reasonably possible that we will adjust the value of our uncertain tax positions related to certain transfer pricing, collaboration matters, withholding taxes and other issues as we receive additional information from various taxing authorities, including reaching settlements with such authorities.\nWe estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could decrease by up to approximately $\n45.0\n million in the next 12 months as a result of various audit closures, settlements and expiration of the statute of limitations.\nNote 18:\nOther Consolidated Financial Statement Detail\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information is summarized as follows:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash paid during the year for:\nInterest\n$\n245.4\n \n$\n252.2\n \n$\n262.5\n \nIncome taxes\n355.1\n \n740.7\n \n932.9\n \nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nComponents of other (income) expense, net, are summarized as follows:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest income\n$\n(\n67.6\n)\n$\n(\n276.5\n)\n$\n(\n89.3\n)\nInterest expense\n250.3\n \n246.9\n \n246.6\n \n(Gains) losses on investments, net\n100.4\n \n291.2\n \n277.3\n \nForeign exchange (gains) losses, net\n30.9\n \n50.4\n \n35.5\n \nGain on sale of equity interest in Samsung Bioepis\n(1)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1,505.4\n)\nLitigation settlement agreement and settlement fees\n—\n \n—\n \n917.0\n \nOther, net\n29.6\n \n3.5\n \n10.1\n \nTotal other (income) expense, net\n$\n343.6\n \n$\n315.5\n \n$\n(\n108.2\n)\n(1)\n Reflects the pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, recognized from the sale of our \n49.9\n% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics in April 2022.

For purposes of this footnote, we refer to RITUXAN and RITUXAN HYCELA collectively as RITUXAN.\nIf we undergo a change in control, as defined in our collaboration agreement, Genentech has the right to present an offer to buy the rights to RITUXAN and we must either accept Genentech’s offer or purchase Genentech’s rights on the same terms as its offer. Genentech will also be deemed concurrently to have purchased our rights to the remaining products in the collaboration on the terms set forth below.\nOur collaboration with Genentech was created through a contractual arrangement and not through a joint venture or other legal entity.\nRITUXAN\nGenentech and its affiliates are responsible for the worldwide manufacture of RITUXAN as well as all development and commercialization activities as follows:\n•\nU.S.:\n \nWe have co-exclusively licensed our rights to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in the U.S.\n•\nCanada:\n \nWe have co-exclusively licensed our rights to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in Canada.\nGAZYVA\nThe Roche Group and its sub-licensees maintain sole responsibility for the development, manufacture and commercialization of GAZYVA in the U.S. The level of gross sales of GAZYVA in the U.S. has impacted our percentage of the co-promotion profits for RITUXAN and LUNSUMIO, as summarized in the table below.\nIf we undergo a change in control, as defined in our collaboration agreement, Genentech will be deemed to have purchased our rights to GAZYVA in exchange for the continued payment of the current compensation payable for GAZYVA under the collaboration arrangement until the \n11\n year anniversary of the first commercial sale of GAZYVA in the U.S.\nOCREVUS\nPursuant to the terms of our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, we receive a tiered royalty on U.S. net sales from \n13.5\n% and increasing up to \n24.0\n% if annual net sales exceed $\n900.0\n million. There will be a \n50.0\n% reduction to these royalties upon the first entry of an FDA approved biosimilar to OCREVUS.\nIn addition, we receive a gross \n3.0\n% royalty on net sales of OCREVUS outside the U.S., with the royalty period lasting \n11\n years from the first commercial sale of OCREVUS on a country-by-country basis.\nThe commercialization of OCREVUS does not impact the percentage of the co-promotion profits we receive for RITUXAN, LUNSUMIO or GAZYVA. Genentech is solely responsible for development and commercialization of OCREVUS and funding future costs. Genentech cannot develop OCREVUS in CLL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or rheumatoid arthritis.\nOCREVUS royalty revenue is based on our estimates from third party and market research data of OCREVUS sales occurring during the corresponding period. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is generally expected to be the following quarter.\nIf we undergo a change in control, as defined in our collaboration agreement, Genentech will be deemed to have purchased our rights to OCREVUS in exchange for the continued payment of the current royalties on net sales (as defined in our collaboration agreement and summarized above) in the U.S. only, until the \n11\n year anniversary of the first commercial sale of OCREVUS in the U.S.\nLUNSUMIO (mosunetuzumab)\nIn January 2022 we exercised our option with Genentech to participate in the joint development and commercialization of LUNSUMIO. Under our collaboration with Genentech, we were responsible for \n30.0\n% of development costs for LUNSUMIO prior to FDA approval and will be entitled to a tiered share of co-promotion operating profits and losses in the U.S., as summarized in the table below. In addition, we receive low-single digit royalties on sales of LUNSUMIO outside the U.S. In December 2022 LUNSUMIO was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.\nF-62\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC.

Under this agreement, we have the option to license therapies arising out of this collaboration and will be responsible for their development and commercialization of such therapies.\nWe may pay Ionis up to $\n260.0\n million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments if new drug candidates advance to marketing approval. Upon commercialization, we may also pay Ionis up to $\n800.0\n million in additional performance-based milestone payments and tiered royalties on potential net sales of such therapies.\nIn December 2021 we exercised our option with Ionis and obtained a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize BIIB115, an investigational ASO in development for SMA.\n2013 Long-term Strategic Research Agreement\nIn September 2013 we entered into a \nsix-year\n research collaboration agreement with Ionis under which both companies collaborate to perform discovery level research and subsequent development and commercialization activities of antisense or other therapeutics for the potential treatment of neurological diseases. Under this agreement, Ionis performs research on a set of neurological targets identified within the agreement. \nIonis is eligible to receive milestone payments, license fees and royalty payments for all product candidates developed through this collaboration, with the specific amount dependent upon the modality of the product candidate advanced by us under the terms of the agreement. \nFor non-ALS antisense product candidates, Ionis is responsible for global development through the completion of a Phase 2 trial and we provide advice on the clinical trial design and regulatory strategy. For ALS antisense product candidates, we are responsible for global development, clinical trial design and regulatory strategy. We have an option to license a product candidate until completion of the Phase 2 trial. If we exercise our option, we will pay Ionis up to a $\n70.0\n million license fee and assume global development, regulatory and commercialization responsibilities. Ionis could receive additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones of up to $\n130.0\n million, plus additional amounts related to the cost of clinical trials conducted by Ionis under the collaboration, and royalties on future sales if we successfully develop the product candidate after option exercise. \nIn December 2018 we exercised our option with Ionis and obtained a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize QALSODY (tofersen), for the treatment of ALS with SOD1 mutations. Following the option exercise, we are solely responsible for the costs and expense related to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of QALSODY.\nIn April 2023 the FDA approved QALSODY for the treatment of ALS in adults who have a mutation in the SOD1 gene. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in plasma neurofilament light chain observed in patients treated with QALSODY. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s). Under this agreement, we make royalty payments to Ionis on annual worldwide net sales of QALSODY using a tiered royalty rate between \n11.0\n% and \n15.0\n%, which are recognized in cost of sales within our consolidated statements of income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred a milestone payment of $\n20.0\n million to Ionis following the approval of QALSODY in the E.U., which was recorded within intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets.

We have an option to license the product candidate\n \nuntil completion of the Phase 2 trial. If we exercise our option, we will pay a license fee of up to $\n70.0\n million to Ionis and assume global development, regulatory and commercialization responsibilities. Ionis is eligible to receive up to $\n130.0\n million in additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones as well as royalties on future sales\n \nif we successfully develop the product candidate after option exercise.\nIn December 2019 we exercised our option with Ionis and obtained a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize BIIB080 (tau ASO), which is currently in Phase 2 development for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In connection with the option exercise, we made a payment of $\n45.0\n million to Ionis, which was recorded in research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income. Future payments may include additional milestone payments of up to $\n155.0\n million and royalties on future sales in the low- to mid-teens if we successfully develop the product candidate after option exercise.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred a milestone payment of $\n10.0\n million, related to the advancement of BIIB080 under this agreement, which was recorded in research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income.\nEisai Co., Ltd. \nDuring the first quarter of 2023 we accrued a $\n31.0\n million payable to Eisai related to the termination of an agreement whereby Eisai co-promoted or distributed our MS products in certain Asia-Pacific markets and settings. As of December 31, 2023, we paid approximately $\n16.0\n million of the $\n31.0\n million payable. The remaining portion was subsequently paid in January 2024. This termination fee is included in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLEQEMBI (lecanemab) Collaboration\nWe have a collaboration agreement with Eisai to jointly develop and commercialize LEQEMBI (lecanemab), an anti-amyloid antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (the LEQEMBI Collaboration).\nEisai serves as the lead of LEQEMBI development and regulatory submissions globally with both companies co-commercializing and co-promoting the product, and Eisai having final decision-making authority. All costs, including research, development, sales and marketing expense, are shared equally between us and Eisai. We and Eisai co-promote LEQEMBI and share profits and losses equally. We currently manufacture LEQEMBI drug substance and drug product and in March 2022 we extended our supply agreement with Eisai related to LEQEMBI from \nfive years\n to \nten years\n for the manufacture of LEQEMBI drug substance.\nThe LEQEMBI Collaboration also provided Eisai with an option to jointly develop and commercialize ADUHELM (aducanumab) (ADUHELM Option), and an option to jointly develop and commercialize one of our anti-tau monoclonal antibodies (Anti-Tau Option). In October 2017 Eisai exercised its ADUHELM Option and we entered into a new collaboration agreement for the joint development and commercialization of ADUHELM (aducanumab) (the ADUHELM Collaboration Agreement).\nIn March 2022 we amended our ADUHELM Collaboration Agreement with Eisai. As of the amendment date, we have sole decision making and commercialization rights worldwide on ADUHELM, and beginning January 1, 2023, Eisai receives only a tiered royalty based on net sales of ADUHELM, and no longer participates in sharing ADUHELM's global profits and losses. In March 2022 we also amended the LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement with Eisai to eliminate the Anti-Tau Option.\nIf either company undergoes a change of control, as defined in our LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement, the non-acquired party may elect to initiate an operational separation, as defined in the LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement. In the event of an operational separation, we would work with Eisai to effect a timely transition of any development, manufacturing or commercial responsibilities regarding LEQEMBI from us to Eisai. In this scenario, as of six months following the change of control, our ongoing responsibility for LEQEMBI related cost-sharing would be reduced to an \nF-66\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\namount equal to \n80.0\n% of what we would have owed prior to the operational separation, and all other economic rights would remain unchanged.\nIn addition, in the event either company undergoes a change of control in which the acquirer is engaged in commercialization of a competing product, as defined in the LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement, the non-acquired party may also request that the acquired party cease commercializing the competing product. Should the acquired party elect to continue commercializing the competing product, the non-acquired party may terminate the LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement. Furthermore, in the event we are the non-acquired party, we may choose either to sell our interest in LEQEMBI to Eisai or purchase Eisai's interest in LEQEMBI, subject to the parameters set forth in the LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement.\nIn July 2023 the FDA granted traditional approval of LEQEMBI. Prior to receiving traditional approval, LEQEMBI had been granted accelerated approval by the FDA in January 2023, at which time it became commercially available in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., LEQEMBI is now approved in Japan (September 2023), China (January 2024), South Korea (May 2024), Hong Kong (July 2024), Israel (July 2024), United Arab Emirates (August 2024), Great Britain (August 2024) and Mexico (December 2024). Additionally, in January 2025 the FDA approved LEQEMBI monthly IV maintenance dosing for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease. \nUpon commercialization of LEQEMBI in the U.S., we began recognizing our \n50.0\n% share of LEQEMBI product revenue, net and cost of sales, including royalties, within Alzheimer's collaboration revenue in our consolidated statements of income, as we are not the principal.\nOur share of LEQEMBI sales and marketing expense and development expense are recorded within selling, general and administrative expense and research and development expense, respectively, within our consolidated statements of income.\nA summary of development and sales and marketing expense related to the LEQEMBI Collaboration is as follows:\n \nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal development expense incurred by the collaboration related to the advancement of LEQEMBI\n$\n329.6\n \n$\n371.9\n \n$\n347.2\n \nBiogen's share of the LEQEMBI Collaboration development expense reflected in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income\n164.8\n \n186.0\n \n173.6\n \nTotal sales and marketing expense incurred by the LEQEMBI Collaboration\n647.0\n \n304.4\n \n104.6\n \nBiogen's share of the LEQEMBI Collaboration sales and marketing expense reflected in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income\n323.5\n \n152.2\n \n52.3\n \nADUHELM Collaboration Agreement\nThe LEQEMBI Collaboration also provided Eisai with an option to jointly develop and commercialize ADUHELM (aducanumab) (ADUHELM Option). In October 2017 Eisai exercised its ADUHELM Option and we entered into a new collaboration agreement for the joint development and commercialization of ADUHELM (the ADUHELM Collaboration Agreement).\nUnder our initial ADUHELM Collaboration Agreement, we would lead the ongoing development of ADUHELM, and we and Eisai would co-promote ADUHELM with a region-based profit split. Beginning in 2019, Eisai was reimbursing us for \n45.0\n% of development and sales and marketing expense incurred by the collaboration for the advancement of ADUHELM.\nIn March 2022 we amended our ADUHELM Collaboration Agreement with Eisai. As of the amendment date, we have sole decision making and commercialization rights worldwide on ADUHELM, and beginning January 1, 2023, Eisai receives only a tiered royalty based on net sales of ADUHELM, and no longer participates in sharing ADUHELM's global profits and losses. Eisai's share of development, commercialization and manufacturing expense was limited to $\n335.0\n million for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, which was achieved as of December 31, 2022.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nMerz Therapeutics (previously Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.)\nIn June 2009 we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Acorda to develop and commercialize products containing fampridine, such as FAMPYRA, in markets outside the U.S.\nUnder this agreement, we pay tiered royalties based on the level of ex-U.S. net sales and we may pay potential milestone payments based on the successful achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones.\nIn January 2024 we notified Acorda of our decision to terminate our collaboration and license agreement, effective January 1, 2025, whereby Acorda regained global commercialization rights to FAMPYRA. On April 1, 2024, Acorda filed for bankruptcy protection and announced its intention to sell substantially all of Acorda's assets to a third party. On July 10, 2024, Merz Therapeutics announced that its subsidiary Merz Pharmaceuticals LLC had completed the acquisition of FAMPYRA, and related assets from Acorda. We are now working with Merz Therapeutics on the transition of global commercialization rights of FAMPYRA and we expect to recognize minimal revenue in 2025.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, total cost of sales related to royalties and commercial supply of FAMPYRA reflected in our consolidated statements of income were approximately $\n52.4\n million, $\n55.2\n million and $\n46.1\n million, respectively.\nSage Therapeutics, Inc.\nIn November 2020 we entered into a global collaboration and license agreement with Sage to jointly develop and commercialize ZURZUVAE (zuranolone) for the treatment of PPD and potential treatment of MDD and BIIB124 (SAGE-324) for the potential treatment of essential tremor with potential in other neurological conditions such as epilepsy. In July 2024 we and Sage announced that the Phase 2 KINETIC 2 dose-range study of BIIB124 did not meet its endpoints. Based on these results, we discontinued our further development of BIIB124 and terminated our rights under the collaboration and license agreement specific to BIIB124, effective February 17, 2025.\nIn connection with the closing of this transaction in December 2020 we purchased $\n650.0\n million of Sage common stock, or approximately \n6.2\n million shares at approximately $\n104.14\n per share, which were initially subject to transfer restrictions. We may pay Sage development and commercial milestone payments that could total up to approximately $\n700.0\n million if all the specified milestones set forth in this collaboration are achieved. \nIn August 2023 the FDA approved ZURZUVAE for adults with PPD, pending DEA scheduling, which was completed in October 2023. Upon approval, ZURZUVAE became the first and only oral, once-daily, 14-day treatment that can provide rapid improvements in depressive symptoms by day 15 for women with PPD. ZURZUVAE for PPD became commercially available in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, the FDA issued a CRL for the NDA for zuranolone in the treatment of adults with MDD. In October 2024 we and Sage agreed to not pursue further development of zuranolone for the potential treatment of MDD. This decision was based on the significant new investment and time we expect would be needed to conduct the additional studies required to support approval of this indication. \nUnder this collaboration, both companies will share equal responsibility and costs for development as well as profits and losses for commercialization in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we are responsible for development and commercialization, excluding Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, with respect to zuranolone and may pay Sage potential tiered royalties in the high teens to low twenties. During the fourth quarter of 2023 we accrued a milestone payment due to Sage of $\n75.0\n million upon the first commercial sale of ZURZUVAE for PPD in the U.S., which was recorded within intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently paid in January 2024.\nWe reflect revenue on sales of ZURZUVAE to third parties in product revenue, net in our consolidated statements of income and record the related cost of revenue and sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of income to their respective line items when these costs are incurred. We share \n50.0\n% of the profit or loss related to our global collaboration and license agreement with Sage, which is recognized in collaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement) in our consolidated statements of income.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net profit-sharing expense of approximately $\n27.0\n million and net loss reimbursement of approximately $\n4.7\n million, respectively, to reflect Sage's \n50.0\n% share \nF-69\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC.

In July 2024 we terminated our license with Denali for the ATV-enabled anti-amyloid beta program. This termination also resulted in the termination of the exclusive option agreement, as discussed above.\nAs part of this collaboration we purchased $\n465.0\n million \nof Denali common stock in September 2020, or approximately \n13\n million shares at approximately $\n34.94\n per share, which were initially subject to transfer restrictions.

The share purchase transaction was completed in November 2018 and, upon closing, we paid \n759.5\n billion South Korean won ($\n676.6\n million) to Samsung BioLogics.\nIn April 2022 we completed the sale of our \n49.9\n%\n equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics in exchange for total consideration of approximately $\n2.3\n billion. Under the terms of this transaction, we received approximately $\n1.0\n billion in cash at closing, with approximately $\n1.3\n billion in cash to be deferred over \ntwo\n payments. The first deferred payment of $\n812.5\n million was received in April 2023 and the second deferred payment of $\n437.5\n million was received in April 2024.\nAs part of this transaction, we are also eligible to receive up to an additional $\n50.0\n million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones. \nOur policy for contingent payments of this nature is to recognize the payments in the period that they become realizable, which is generally the same period in which the payments are earned.\nPrior to this sale, we recognized our share of the results of operations related to our investment in Samsung Bioepis under the equity method of accounting one quarter in arrears when the results of the entity became available, which was reflected as equity in (income) loss of investee, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income.\nUpon our November 2018 investment, the equity method of accounting required us to identify and allocate differences between the fair value of our investment and the carrying value of our interest in the underlying net assets of the investee. These basis differences were being amortized over their economic life, until the completion of the sale in April 2022, as discussed above. The total basis difference was approximately $\n675.0\n million and related to inventory, developed technology, IPR&D and deferred tax balances. The basis differences related to inventory were amortized, net of tax, over their estimated useful lives of \n1.5\n years, and the basis differences related to developed technology and IPR&D for marketed products were being amortized, net of tax, over their estimated useful lives of \n15\n years.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized net income on our investment of $\n2.6\n million, reflecting our share of Samsung Bioepis' operating profits, net of tax, totaling $\n17.0\n million offset by amortization of basis differences totaling $\n14.4\n million. Following the sale of Samsung Bioepis we no longer recognize gains or losses associated with Samsung Bioepis' results of operations and amortization related to basis differences.\nFor additional information on the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, please read \nNote 3, Dispositions\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\n2019 Development and Commercialization Agreement\nIn December 2019 we completed a transaction with Samsung Bioepis and secured the exclusive rights to commercialize \ntwo\n potential ophthalmology biosimilar products, BYOOVIZ, a ranibizumab biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS, and OPUVIZ, an aflibercept biosimilar referencing EYLEA, in major markets worldwide, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nIn October 2024 we notified Samsung Bioepis of our decision to terminate our 2019 Development and Commercialization Agreement (the DCA Agreement) solely within the U.S. and Canada. As a result of this termination we recognized impairment charges of approximately $\n20.2\n million, which were recorded within amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024. Biogen will transfer commercialization rights for BYOOVIZ and OPUVIZ in the U.S. and Canada back to Samsung Bioepis over a period of up to 18 months. During this transition period, we will continue to commercialize BYOOVIZ. The termination does not impact the other markets in the DCA Agreement.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024 we made a milestone payment of $\n15.0\n million to Samsung Bioepis related to the approval of OPUVIZ in the E.U., which was recorded within intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. We may also pay Samsung Bioepis up to approximately $\n150.0\n million in additional development, regulatory and sales-based milestones associated with the remaining major markets covered by the agreement.\nWe reflect revenue on sales of BYOOVIZ to third parties in product revenue, net in our consolidated statements of income and record the related cost of revenue and sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of income to their respective line items when these costs are incurred.\n2013 Commercial Agreement\nIn December 2013 we entered into an agreement with Samsung Bioepis to commercialize, over a \n10-year\n term, 3 anti-TNF biosimilar product candidates which includes IMRALDI, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA, FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE, and BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL, in Europe. \nIn July 2024 we exercised an option to extend this agreement by an additional \nfive years\n, and paid Samsung Bioepis an option exercise fee of $\n60.0\n million, which was recorded within intangible assets, net within our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.\nWe reflect revenue on sales of BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI to third parties in product revenue, net in our consolidated statements of income and record the related cost of revenue and sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of income to their respective line items when these costs are incurred. Royalty payments to AbbVie on sales of IMRALDI are recognized in cost of sales within our consolidated statements of income.\nWe share \n50.0\n% of the profit or loss related to our 2013 commercial agreement with Samsung Bioepis, which is recognized in collaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement) in our consolidated statements of income.

Under this license agreement, we granted Samsung Bioepis an exclusive license to use, develop, manufacture and commercialize biosimilar products created by Samsung Bioepis using Biogen product-specific technology. In exchange, we receive single digit royalties on biosimilar products developed and commercialized by Samsung Bioepis. Royalty revenue under the license agreement is recognized as a component of contract manufacturing, royalty and other revenue in our consolidated statements of income.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized approximately $\n14.4\n million, $\n13.6\n million and $\n20.6\n million, respectively, as a component of contract manufacturing, royalty and other revenue in our consolidated statements of income related to the license agreement and other services performed under our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis. \nAmounts receivable from Samsung Bioepis related to the agreements discussed above were approximately $\n7.6\n million and $\n9.9\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 20:\nInvestments in Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nOur consolidated financial statements include the financial results of variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. The following are our significant variable interest entities.\nNeurimmune SubOne AG\nBeginning in 2007 we consolidated the results of Neurimmune as we determined we were the primary beneficiary because we had the power through the collaboration to direct the activities that most significantly impacted the entity's economic performance and we were required to fund \n100.0\n% of the research and development costs incurred in support of the collaboration. The collaboration and license agreement with Neurimmune was for the development and commercialization of antibodies for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease, including ADUHELM (as amended, the Neurimmune Agreement).\nIn November 2023 we notified Neurimmune of our decision to terminate the Neurimmune Agreement. Subsequent to the termination, we reconsidered our relationship with Neurimmune and determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. As a result, we recorded a net gain on the deconsolidation of Neurimmune of approximately $\n3.0\n million, which was recorded in other (income) expense, net within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, upon issuance of the final NCD related to ADUHELM, we recorded an increase in a valuation allowance of approximately $\n85.0\n million to reduce the net value of a previously recorded deferred tax asset in Switzerland on Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM, the realization of which was dependent on future sales of ADUHELM, to zero. This adjustment to our net deferred tax asset was recorded with an equal and offsetting amount assigned to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income, resulting in a zero net impact to net income attributable to Biogen Inc.\nExcluding the impact of the Neurimmune deferred tax asset, the assets and liabilities of Neurimmune are not significant to our consolidated financial position or results of operations as it is a research and development organization. We have provided no financing to Neurimmune other than contractually required amounts.\nResearch and development costs for which we reimbursed Neurimmune are reflected in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, amounts reimbursed were immaterial.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Eisai, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nUnconsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nWe have relationships with various variable interest entities that we do not consolidate as we lack the power to direct the activities that significantly impact the economic success of these entities. These relationships include investments in certain biotechnology companies and research collaboration agreements. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of our investments in certain biotechnology companies representing potential unconsolidated variable interest entities totaled $\n23.6\n million and $\n16.4\n million, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these variable interest entities is limited to the carrying value of our investments.\nWe have also entered into research collaboration agreements with certain variable interest entities where we are required to fund certain development activities. These development activities are included in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income as they are incurred. We have provided no financing to these variable interest entities other than previous contractually required amounts.\nNote 21:\nLitigation\nWe are currently involved in various claims, investigations and legal proceedings, including the matters described below.

If an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss can be made at this time, it is included in the potential loss contingency description below.\nThe claims and legal proceedings in which we are involved also include challenges to the scope, validity or enforceability of the patents relating to our products, pipeline or processes and challenges to the scope, validity or enforceability of the patents held by others. These include claims by third parties that we infringe their patents. An adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could result in one or more of the following and have a material impact on our business or consolidated results of operations and financial position: (i) loss of patent protection; (ii) inability to continue to engage in certain activities; and (iii) payment of significant damages, royalties, penalties and/or license fees to third parties.\nLoss Contingencies\nSecurities Litigation asserted against Biogen\nWe and certain current and former officers are defendants in three securities actions pending in the District Court, one filed by Nadia Shash and Amjad Khan in November 2020 and related to statements about ADUHELM, one filed by the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System in February 2022 and related to statements about ADUHELM, and one filed by Thomas Allen Gray in June 2024 and related to statements about LEQEMBI, TECFIDERA and VUMERITY. All allege violations of federal securities laws under 15 U.S.C. §78j(b) and §78t(a) and 17 C.F.R. §240.10b-5 and seek declarations of the actions as class actions and monetary relief.\nDerivative Actions\nWe and members of the Board of Directors are named as defendants in five derivative actions pending in the District Court, one filed by The Booth Family Trust in February 2022, one filed by Elaine Wang in July 2022, one filed by Jonathan Blaufarb (Blaufarb I) in July 2024, one filed by Lawrence Hollin in October 2024 and one filed by Jonathan Blaufarb (Blaufarb II) in October 2024. The Booth, Wang and Blaufarb II actions relate to ADUHELM and other matters, and the Blaufarb I and Hollin actions relate to statements about LEQEMBI, our compliance controls, 2023 earnings guidance and other matters. The actions allege breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and other common law claims, and violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §78a et seq. The actions seek declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary relief payable to Biogen, and attorneys’ fees and costs payable to the plaintiffs. The Booth and Wang actions are stayed.\nIMRALDI Patent Litigation\nIn June 2024, the Technical Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office upheld the validity of Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH's (Fresenius Kabi's) European Patent 3 145 488 (the EP '488 Patent), which expires in May 2035. In June 2022 Fresenius Kabi filed a claim for damages and injunctive relief against Biogen France SAS in the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris alleging that IMRALDI, the adalimumab biosimilar product of Samsung Bioepis that Biogen commercializes in Europe, infringes the French counterpart of the EP ‘488 Patent. In March 2024 the Düsseldorf Regional Court dismissed Fresenius Kabi's claim of infringement of the German counterpart of the EP '488 Patent and Fresenius Kabi has appealed to the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf.\nLitigation with Former Convergence Shareholders\nIn 2015 Biogen acquired Convergence, a U.K. company. In 2019 Shareholder Representative Services LLC, on behalf of the former shareholders of Convergence, asserted claims of $\n200.0\n million for alleged breaches of the contract pursuant to which we acquired Convergence. In June 2023 Shareholder Representative Services LLC and 24 former shareholders filed a suit against us in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales asserting one of the 2019 claims and seeking payment of $\n49.9\n million, interest and costs.\nHumana Patient Assistance Litigation\nIn March 2023 the District Court dismissed the previously disclosed action filed against us by Humana in September 2020.

Plaintiffs are Local No. 1 Health Fund, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Teamsters Local 237 Welfare Fund and Teamsters Local 237 Retirees' Benefit Fund, New York State Teamsters Council Health and Hospital Fund, and UFCW Local 1500 Welfare Fund. Plaintiffs allege violations of federal antitrust laws including 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2 and 13(c) and of various state laws, based on contracts with pharmacy benefit managers related to TECFIDERA and VUMERITY. Plaintiffs seek declarations of the actions as class actions, monetary, declaratory and equitable relief, and attorneys' fees and costs.\nOther Matters\nGovernment Investigations\nWe have received subpoenas from the SEC seeking information relating to ADUHELM and its launch, and our equity plans. We have also received subpoenas from the DOJ and SEC seeking information relating to our business operations in several foreign countries. The Italian Competition Authority is investigating Biogen and other companies in relation to our biosimilar product BYOOVIZ.\nTYSABRI Biosimilar Patent Matter\nIn September 2022 we filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Sandoz Inc., other Sandoz entities and Polpharma Biologics S.A. under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, 42 U.S.C. §262, seeking a declaratory judgment of patent infringement.\nHatch-Waxman Act Litigation relating to VUMERITY Orange-Book Listed Patents\nIn July 2023 Biogen and Alkermes Pharma Ireland Limited filed patent infringement proceedings relating to VUMERITY Orange-Book listed patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,669,281, 9,090,558 and 10,080,733) pursuant to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Zydus Worldwide DMCC.\nProduct Liability and Other Legal Proceedings\nWe are also involved in product liability claims and other legal proceedings incidental to our normal business activities. While the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nF-75\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC.

We have elected to initiate a technology transfer and, following a transition period, to manufacture VUMERITY or have VUMERITY manufactured by a third party we have engaged in exchange for paying an increased royalty rate to Alkermes on any portion of future worldwide net commercial sales of VUMERITY that is manufactured by us or our designee.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangement with Alkermes, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nSKYCLARYS\nIn connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we assumed additional contractual obligations related to royalty payments. Reata entered into agreements to pay royalties on future sales of SKYCLARYS, which will cumulatively range in the low- to mid-single digits.\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read \nNote 2, Acquisitions\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nContingent Consideration related to Business Combinations\nIn connection with our acquisition of HI-Bio in July 2024 we may make additional payments based upon the achievement of certain milestone events. We recognized the contingent consideration obligations associated with this acquisition at its fair value on the acquisition date and we revalue this obligation each reporting period. We may pay up to an additional \n$\n650.0\n million\n \nin potential future development and regulatory milestone payments.\n The acquisition-date fair value of these milestones was approximately $\n485.1\n million.\nRegulatory and Commercial Milestone Payments\nBased on our development plans as of December 31, 2024, we could trigger potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately $\n3.8\n billion, including approximately $\n0.5\n billion in development milestones, approximately $\n0.5\n billion in regulatory milestones and approximately $\n2.8\n billion in commercial milestones, as part \nF-76\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nof our various collaborations, including licensing and development programs and HI-Bio's pre-existing commitments, as discussed below. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones was not considered probable as of December 31, 2024, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones.\nIf certain clinical and commercial milestones are met, we may pay up to approximately $\n73.6\n million in milestones in 2025 under our current agreements, excluding opt-in payments.\nWe acquired HI-Bio's pre-existing in-license commitments under third-party agreements, which include tiered royalties on potential future sales of felzartamab and izastobart/HIB210, ranging from high-single digit to mid-teen percentages, as well as potential future development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments related to felzartamab and izastobart/HIB210 of up to $\n130.0\n million, $\n230.0\n million and $\n640.0\n million, respectively. This amount includes potential milestone payments due upon the first patient dosed in a phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab in a first and second indication of $\n35.0\n million and $\n30.0\n million, respectively.\nOther Funding Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have several ongoing clinical studies in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The contracts with CROs are generally cancellable, with notice, at our option. We recorded accrued expense of approximately $\n21.7\n million in our consolidated balance sheets for expenditures incurred by CROs as of December 31, 2024. We have approximately $\n509.2\n million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts as of December 31, 2024.\nTax Related Obligations\nWe exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2024, we have approximately $\n173.8\n million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have accrued income tax liabilities of approximately $\n234.0\n million and $\n419.5\n million, respectively, under the Transition Toll Tax. The amount accrued as of December 31, 2024, is expected to be paid within one year. The Transition Toll Tax is being paid in installments over an eight--year period, which started in 2018, and will not accrue interest. For additional information on the Transition Toll Tax, please read \nNote 17, Income Taxes\n, to these consolidated financial statements.\nNote 23:\nGuarantees\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not have significant liabilities recorded for guarantees.\nWe enter into indemnification provisions under our agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business, typically with business partners, contractors, clinical sites and customers. Under these provisions, we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, to date we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nNote 24:\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor various retirement and pension plans. Our estimates of liabilities and expense for these plans incorporate a number of assumptions, including expected rates of return on plan assets and interest rates used to discount future benefits.\n401(k) Savings Plan\nWe maintain a 401(k) Savings Plan, which is available to substantially all regular employees in the U.S. over the age of \n21\n. Participants may make voluntary contributions. We make matching contributions according to the 401(k) \nF-77\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nSavings Plan’s matching formula. All matching contributions and participant contributions vest immediately. The 401(k) Savings Plan also holds certain transition contributions on behalf of participants who previously participated in the Biogen, Inc. Retirement Plan. The expense related to our 401(k) Savings Plan primarily consists of our matching contributions.\nExpense related to our 401(k) Savings Plan totaled approximately $\n51.5\n million, $\n55.9\n million and $\n56.0\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nWe maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, known as the SSP, which allows a select group of management employees in the U.S. to defer a portion of their compensation. The SSP also provides certain credits to highly compensated U.S. employees that are paid by the company. These credits are known as the Restoration Match. The deferred compensation amounts are accrued when earned. Such deferred compensation is distributable in cash in accordance with the rules of the SSP. Deferred compensation amounts under such plan as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, totaled approximately $\n140.6\n million and $\n134.6\n million, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The SSP also holds certain transition contributions on behalf of participants who previously participated in the Biogen, Inc. Retirement Plan. The Restoration Match and participant contributions vest immediately. Distributions to participants can be either in one lump sum payment or annual installments as elected by the participants.\nPension Plans\nOur retiree benefit plans include defined benefit plans for employees in our affiliates in Switzerland and Germany as well as other insignificant defined benefit plans in certain other countries where we maintain an operating presence.\nOur Swiss plan is a government-mandated retirement fund that provides employees with a minimum investment return. The minimum investment return is determined annually by the Swiss government and was \n1.00\n% in 2024, \n1.75\n% in 2023 and \n2.00\n% in 2022. Under the Swiss plan, both we and certain of our employees with annual earnings in excess of government determined amounts are required to make contributions into a fund managed by an independent investment fiduciary. Employer contributions must be in an amount at least equal to the employee’s contribution. Minimum employee contributions are based on the respective employee’s age, salary and gender. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Swiss plan had an unfunded net pension obligation of $\n61.5\n million and $\n51.5\n million, respectively, and plan assets that totaled $\n224.7\n million and $\n239.6\n million, respectively. In 2024, 2023 and 2022 we recognized net expense totaling $\n17.5\n million, $\n17.6\n million and $\n20.0\n million, respectively, related to our Swiss plan, of which $\n6.0\n million, $\n5.1\n million and $\n5.3\n million, respectively, was included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.\nThe obligations under the German plans are unfunded and totaled $\n45.6\n million and $\n46.5\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net periodic pension cost related to the German plans totaled $\n3.8\n million, $\n3.6\n million and $\n5.9\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which $\n1.1\n million, $\n0.8\n million and $\n1.8\n million, respectively, was included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.\nNote 25:\nSegment Information\nWe operate and are managed as \none\n operating segment, and derive revenue from activities related to the discovery, development and delivery of innovative therapies for people living with serious and complex diseases.\nOur research and development organization is responsible for the research and discovery of new product candidates and supports development and registration efforts for potential future products.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made \nF-81\nTable of Contents\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nReserves for Medicaid and Managed Care Rebates in the U.S.\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized revenue from product sales, net of reserves, including contractual adjustments related to Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S. Within accrued expense and other, revenue-related reserves amounted to $937.5 million as of December 31, 2024. A portion of this balance includes contractual adjustments for Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S. Medicaid rebates relate to the Company’s estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. The Company’s liability for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make for the current quarter, claims for prior quarters that have been estimated for which an invoice has not been received, invoices received for claims from the prior quarters that have not been paid and an estimate of potential claims that will be made for inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end. Managed care rebates in the U.S. represent the Company’s estimated obligations to third-parties, primarily pharmacy benefit managers. These rebates result from performance-based goals, formulary position and price increase limit allowances (price protection). The calculation of the accrual for these rebates is based on an estimate of the coverage patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. Rebate accruals for Medicaid and managed care in the U.S. are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities. The estimates of the reserves for Medicaid and managed care in the U.S. reflect historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to reserves for Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S. is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty when developing the estimate of the reserves and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to historical experience, current contractual requirements, specific known market events, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's estimate of the reserves for Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S. These procedures also included, among others (i) developing an independent estimate of the reserves for Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S. by utilizing third-party data related to product demand, data related to price changes, the terms of the specific rebate programs, the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid and consideration of contractual requirement changes and market events; (ii) comparing the independent estimate to management’s estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimate; and (iii) testing, on a sample basis, rebate claims paid by the Company, including evaluating the claims for consistency with the contractual terms of the Company’s rebate agreements.\nF-82\nTable of Contents\nAcquisition of Human Immunology Biosciences, Inc. (HI-Bio) - Valuation of In-Process Research and Development Intangible Assets\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on July 2, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of HI-Bio for total consideration of $1,622.4 million. In-process research and development (IPR&D) intangible assets of $1,635.0 million were recorded, which include $920.0 million related to felzartamab indication for immunoglobulin A. nephropathy (IgAN), $450.0 million related to felzartamab indication for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and $265.0 million related to felzartamab indication for primary membranous nephropathy (PMN). Management uses the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a form of the income approach, utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates in estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired when allocating the purchase consideration paid for the acquisition. The estimates of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets involve significant judgment by management and include assumptions with measurement uncertainty, such as the amount and timing of projected cash flow, long-term sales forecasts, discount rates, and the timing and probability of regulatory and commercial success.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of IPR&D intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of HI-Bio is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty when developing the fair value estimate of the IPR&D intangible assets acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to long-term sales forecasts, discount rate, and the probability of regulatory and commercial success for the IPR&D intangible assets acquired; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the IPR&D intangible assets acquired. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the IPR&D intangible assets acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method used by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain of the data used in the multi-period excess earnings method; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to long-term sales forecasts, discount rate, and the probability of regulatory and commercial success for the IPR&D intangible assets acquired. Evaluating management's assumptions related to long-term sales forecasts and the probability of regulatory and commercial success for the IPR&D intangible assets acquired involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the acquired business and (ii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating management’s assumption related to long-term sales forecasts also involved considering the consistency with external market and industry data. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate significant assumption for the IPR&D intangible assets acquired.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 12, 2025\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2003.\nF-83"
