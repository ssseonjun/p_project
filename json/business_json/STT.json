MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in this Form 10-K. Certain previously reported amounts presented in this Form 10-K have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation. \nAs of December 31, 2024\n, we had consolidated total assets of $353.24 billion, consolidated total deposits of $261.92 billion, consolidated total shareholders’ equity of $25.33 billion and approximately 53,000 employees. T\nhrough our two lines of business, Investment Servicing and Investment Management, we operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. \nFor the description of our lines of business, refer to “Lines of Business” in Item 1 in this Form 10-K. For financial and other information about our lines of business, refer to “Line of Business Information” in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.\nInformation about the significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods is included under “Significant Accounting Estimates” in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nCertain financial information provided in this Form 10-K, including this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, is presented using both a U.S. GAAP, or reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis, including certain non-GAAP measures used in the calculation of identified regulatory ratios. We measure and compare certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including information that management uses in evaluating our business and activities. Non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or as superior to, \nfinancial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAP financial information presented in this Form 10-K, including this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable currently applicable regulatory ratio or U.S. GAAP-basis measure. As part of our non-GAAP-basis measures, we present a fully taxable-equivalent NII that reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, which we believe facilitates an investor’s understanding and analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends.\nIn this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the effects of changes in foreign currency translation, those effects are determined by applying applicable weighted average FX rates from the relevant 2023 period to the relevant 2024 period results.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of U.S. securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information about forward-looking statements and related risks and uncertainties is provided in “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors Summary” and “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.\nInformation regarding additional disclosures and materials available on our website is provided under “Additional Information” in Item 1 in this Form 10-K. \n State Street Corporation | 58\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS\nTABLE 1: OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS\nYears Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal fee revenue\n$\n10,156\n \n$\n9,480 \n$\n9,606 \nNet interest income\n2,923\n \n2,759 \n2,544 \nTotal other income\n(79)\n(294)\n(2)\nTotal revenue\n13,000\n \n11,945 \n12,148 \nProvision for credit losses\n75\n \n46 \n20 \nTotal expenses\n9,530\n \n9,583 \n8,801 \nIncome before income tax expense\n3,395\n \n2,316 \n3,327 \nIncome tax expense \n708\n \n372 \n553 \nNet income\n$\n2,687\n \n$\n1,944 \n$\n2,774 \nAdjustments to net income:\nDividends on preferred stock\n(1)\n$\n(202)\n$\n(122)\n$\n(112)\nEarnings allocated to participating securities\n(2)\n(2)\n(1)\n(2)\nNet income available to common shareholders\n$\n2,483\n \n$\n1,821 \n$\n2,660 \nEarnings per common share:\nBasic\n$\n8.33\n \n$\n5.65 \n$\n7.28 \nDiluted\n8.21\n \n5.58 \n7.19 \nAverage common shares outstanding (in thousands):\nBasic\n297,883\n \n322,337 \n365,214 \nDiluted\n302,226\n \n326,568 \n370,109 \nCash dividends declared per common share\n$\n2.90\n \n$\n2.64 \n$\n2.40 \nReturn on average common equity\n11.1\n \n%\n8.2 \n%\n11.1 \n%\nPre-tax margin\n26.1\n \n19.4 \n27.4 \nReturn on average assets\n0.9\n \n0.7 \n1.0 \nCommon dividend payout\n35.3\n \n47.3 \n33.4 \nAverage common equity to average total assets\n7.2\n \n8.1 \n8.3 \n(1) \nAdditional information about our preferred stock dividends is provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\n(2) \nRepresents the portion of net income available to common equity allocated to participating securities, composed of unvested and fully vested SERP (Supplemental executive retirement plans) shares and fully vested deferred director stock awards, which are equity-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, and are considered to participate with the common stock in undistributed earnings.\nThe following section provides information related to significant events, as well as highlights of our consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2024 presented in Table 1: Overview of Financial Results. More detailed information about our consolidated financial results, including the comparison of our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2024 to those of the year ended December 31, 2023, is provided under “Consolidated Results of Operations”, “Line of Business Information” and “Capital” sections which follow “Financial Results and Highlights”, as well as in our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe comparison of our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 to those of the years ended December 31, 2022 is included in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024.\nFinancial Results and Highlights\n2024 financial performance\n•\nEPS of $8.21, increased from $5.58 in 2023, primarily reflecting higher total revenue and lower total expenses, including the net impact of notable items in the current and prior year periods, which in aggregate represented $1.62 of the EPS increase. See “Notable Items” below.\n•\nTotal revenue increased 9% compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher fee revenue and NII and the impact of the loss on sale of investment securities notable item in the prior year period. The prior year notable item represented 3% points of the increase.\n•\nTotal expenses decreased 1% compared to 2023 as higher business investments, as well as revenue and performance-related costs, were more than offset by productivity savings from organizational simplification, process improvements and other initiatives, including from the joint venture consolidations in India and the net impact of notable items. The net impact of notable items in the current and prior year periods decreased expenses by 5% points in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n•\nPre-tax margin of 26.1% increased from 19.4% in 2023, primarily reflecting higher total revenue and lower total expenses. Return on equity of 11.1% increased from 8.2% in 2023, primarily reflecting higher total revenue and lower total expenses.\n•\nOperating leverage was 9.4% points, largely reflecting the net impact of notable items in the current and prior year periods, which represented 7.4% points of operating leverage. Operating leverage represents the difference between the percentage change in total revenue and the percentage change in total expenses, in each case relative to the prior year period.\n•\nFee operating leverage was 7.7% points, largely reflecting the net impact of notable items in the current and prior year periods, which represented 5.6% points of fee operating leverage. Fee operating leverage represents the difference between the percentage change in total fee revenue and the percentage change in total expenses, in each case relative to the prior year period.\n•\nReturned approximately $2.2 billion to our shareholders in the form of common share repurchases and common stock dividends compared to approximately $4.6 billion in 2023. \n State Street Corporation | 59\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n•\nCompleted the consolidation of our final joint venture in India, further advancing the plan to transform our operating model to unlock efficiency savings and improve client experience. The joint venture consolidation in 2024 increased our headcount by approximately 17% as of December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. Associated headcount cost was previously reflected in compensation and employee benefits expenses.\nNotable Items\n•\nThe impact of notable items in 2024 includes:\n◦\nOther expenses of $111 million, including a $99 million increase to the 2023 FDIC special assessment, and a $12 million charge associated with operating model changes.\n◦\nLoss on sale of investment securities of $81 million related to an investment portfolio repositioning reflected in other income.\n◦\nDeferred compensation expense acceleration of approximately $79 million, related to prior period incentive compensation awards to align our deferred pay mix with peers.\n◦\nGain on sale of an equity investment of $66 million recorded in other fee revenue.\n◦\nRevenue-related recovery of $15 million from settlement proceeds associated with a 2018 FX benchmark litigation resolution, which is reflected in foreign exchange trading services.\n◦\nNet repositioning release of $2 million, including a $15 million release reflected in compensation and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by $13 million of occupancy charges related to footprint optimization.\n◦\nThe impact of notable items in 2023 includes:\n◦\nLoss on the sale of investment securities of approximately $294 million related to an investment portfolio repositioning.\n◦\nFDIC special assessment of $387 million recorded in other expenses, related to FDIC’s recovery of estimated losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with the \nclosures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\n◦\nNet repositioning charges of approximately $203 million, including $182 million of compensation and employee benefits expenses related to workforce rationalization and $21 million of occupancy costs related to real estate footprint optimization.\n◦\nOther net expenses of approximately $30 million, including $41 million in information systems and communications and $4 million in other expenses, primarily related to operating model changes, partially offset by a $15 million accrual release in acquisition and restructuring costs.\nRevenue\n•\nTotal fee revenue increased 7% compared to 2023, primarily reflecting higher management fees, foreign exchange trading services revenue, other fee revenue and servicing fees.\n•\nServicing fee revenue increased 2% compared to 2023, as higher average market levels and net new business, excluding a previously disclosed client transition, were partially offset by pricing headwinds, a previously disclosed client transition and lower client activity and adjustments, including asset mix shift.\n•\nManagement fee revenue increased 13% compared to 2023, primarily due to higher average market levels and net inflows. \n•\nForeign exchange trading services revenue increased 11% compared to 2023, primarily due to higher client volumes, partially offset by lower spreads associated with lower average FX volatility.\n•\nSecurities finance revenue increased 3% compared to 2023, mainly due to higher client lending balances, partially offset by lower spreads primarily resulting from muted industry specials activity.\n▪\nSoftware and processing fees revenue increased 9% compared to 2023, primarily due to higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD.\n•\nOther fee revenue increased $109 million compared to 2023, primarily reflecting a $66 million gain on sale of an equity investment and the absence of the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation in the prior year period.\n State Street Corporation | 60\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n•\nNII increased 6% compared to 2023, primarily due to higher investment securities yields and loan growth, partially offset by deposit mix shift towards interest-bearing deposits.\n•\nOther income included a loss of $79 million compared to a loss of $294 million in 2023, mainly reflecting a loss on sale of investment securities related to the repositioning of the investment portfolio in both periods.\nProvision for Credit Losses\n•\nIn 2024, we recorded a $75 million provision for credit losses, primarily reflecting an increase in loan loss reserves associated with certain commercial real estate and leveraged loans, compared to $46 million in 2023.\nExpenses\n•\nTotal expenses decreased 1% compared to 2023, as higher business investments, as well as revenue and performance-related costs, were more than offset by productivity savings from organizational simplification, process improvements and other initiatives, including from the joint venture consolidations in India and the net impact of notable items. The net impact of notable items in the current and prior year periods decreased expenses by 5% points in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nAUC/A and AUM\n•\nAUC/A of $46.56 trillion as of December 31, 2024 increased 11% compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher period-end market levels and client flows. In 2024, newly announced asset servicing mandates totaled approximately $2.33 trillion of AUC/A. We onboarded approximately $1.35 trillion of AUC/A during 2024. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $2.99 trillion as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nAUM of $4.72 trillion as of December 31, 2024 increased 15% compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher period-end market levels and net inflows.\nCapital \n•\nIn 2024, we returned approximately $2.2 billion to our shareholders in the form of common share repurchases and common stock dividends compared to approximately $4.6 billion in 2023.\n◦\nWe declared aggregate common stock dividends of $2.90 per share, totaling \n$859 million compared to $2.64 per share, totaling $837 million in 2023.\n◦\nWe increased the quarterly common stock dividend declared per common share by 10% in the third quarter of 2024.\n◦\nWe acquired an aggregate of 15.1 million shares of common stock at an average per share cost of $85.89 and an aggregate cost of approximately $1.3 billion. In 2023, we acquired an aggregate of 49.2 million shares of common stock, at an average per share cost of $77.22 and an aggregate cost of approximately $3.8 billion. These purchases were all conducted under the share repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors. \n•\nOur standardized CET1 capital ratio was 10.9% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 11.6% as of December 31, 2023, primarily driven by increased capital return and higher deployment of RWA for business growth, partially offset by capital generated from earnings. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 5.2% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 5.5% as of December 31, 2023, mainly driven by higher average balance sheet levels. Given the current global economic environment, and our plans for capital actions, we expect our CET1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio to remain within or above our target ranges of 10-11% and 5.25-5.75%, respectively.\n•\nOn January 31, 2024, we issued 1.5 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of fixed rate reset, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series I, without par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share), and an initial dividend rate of 6.700% per annual, in a public offering.

Servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately \n70%, 72% and 73% of the total fee revenue in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n State Street Corporation | 62\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nServicing Fee Revenue\nServicing fees, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, increased 2% in 2024 compared to 2023, as higher average market levels and net new business, excluding a previously disclosed client transition, were partially offset by pricing headwinds, a previously disclosed client transition and lower client activity and adjustments, including asset mix shift. \nServicing fees generated outside the United States were approximately 47% of total servicing fees in 2024, compared to approximately 46% of total servicing fees in 2023.\nServicing fee revenue comprises revenue from a range of services provided to our clients, including certain Alpha servicing mandates, consisting of core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration, which we refer to collectively as back office services and middle office services. The nature and mix of services provided and the asset classes for which the services are performed affect our servicing fees. The basis for fees will differ across regions and clients. Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our services. For servicing fees for which we have not yet issued an invoice to our clients as of period end, we include an estimate of the impact of changes in market valuations, client activity and flows, net new business and changes in pricing in our revenues.  \nChanges in Market Valuations\nOur servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes, and geography of assets held within our clients’ portfolios. For certain asset classes where the valuation process is more complex, including alternative investments, or where our valuation is dependent on third party information, AUC/A is reported on a time lag, typically one-month. For those asset classes, the impact of market levels on our reported AUC/A, and therefore servicing fee revenue, does not reflect current period-end market levels.\nOver the five years ended December 31, 2024, we estimate that worldwide equity and fixed income market valuations impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately 2% on average with a range of (4)% to 8% annually and approximately 5% and 1% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Year-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.\nAssuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity, asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of December 31, 2024, that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors remain constant and using relevant information as of December 31, 2024, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, have a smaller corresponding impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time. \nTABLE 3: DAILY AVERAGES, MONTH-END AVERAGES AND YEAR-END EQUITY INDICES\n(1)\nDaily Averages of Indices\nMonth-End Averages of Indices\nYear-End Indices\nYears Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nS&P 500\n®\n5,428\n \n4,284 \n27 \n%\n5,460\n \n4,323 \n26 \n%\n5,882\n \n4,770 \n23 \n%\nMSCI EAFE\n®\n2,326\n \n2,093 \n11 \n2,337\n \n2,101 \n11 \n2,262\n \n2,236 \n1 \nMSCI\n®\n Emerging Markets\n1,071\n \n985 \n9 \n1,071\n \n985 \n9 \n1,075\n \n1,024 \n5 \nMSCI  ACWI\n®\n800\n \n663 \n21 \n805\n \n668 \n20 \n841\n \n727 \n16 \n (1)\n The index names listed in the table are service marks of their respective owners.\nTABLE 4: YEAR-END DEBT INDICES\n(1)\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nBloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index\n®\n2,189\n \n2,162 \n1 \n%\nBloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index\n®\n463\n \n471 \n(2)\n(1) \nThe index names listed in the table are service marks of their respective owners.\n State Street Corporation | 63\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nClient Activity and Asset Flows\nClient activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wire transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors, including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.\nOur clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Over the five years ended December 31, 2024, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately (1)% on average with a range of (3)% to 1% annually and approximately 0% and (3)% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow information. While the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.\nTABLE 5: INDUSTRY ASSET FLOWS\nYears Ended December 31, \n(In billions)\n2024\n2023\nNorth America - (U.S. Domiciled) - Morningstar Direct  Market Data\n(1)(2)(3)\nLong-Term Funds\n(4)\n$\n(362.0)\n$\n(489.7)\nMoney Market\n678.6\n \n907.3 \nExchange-Traded Fund\n1,111.1\n \n590.3 \nTotal Flows\n$\n1,427.7\n \n$\n1,007.9 \nEMEA - Morningstar Direct Market Data\n(1)(2)(5)\nLong-Term Funds\n(4)\n$\n233.0\n \n$\n(72.3)\nMoney Market\n245.7\n \n217.8 \nExchange-Traded Fund\n251.3\n \n146.0 \nTotal Flows\n$\n730.0\n \n$\n291.5 \n(1) \nIndustry data is provided for illustrative purposes only.

The long-term fund flows reported by Morningstar direct in EMEA are composed of the European market flows mainly in Equities, Allocation and Fixed-Income asset classes.\n(5) \nThe year ended December 31, 2024 data for Europe is on a rolling twelve month basis for December 2023 through November 2024, sourced by Morningstar.\n \nNet New Business\nOver the five years ended December 31, 2024, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 0% on average with a range of 0% to 1% annually and approximately 0% and 1% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nGross investment servicing mandates were $2.33 trillion of AUC/A in 2024 and $1.90 trillion of AUC/A per year on average over the five years ended December 31, 2024, ranging from approximately $0.79 trillion to $3.52 trillion of AUC/A annually in any given year.\nServicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of assets installed.\nRevenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation timeline, in general, can range from 6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately 9 to 12 months over the past 2 full fiscal years. We expect that our more complex installations, including new State Street Alpha mandates, will generally be on the longer end of the 6 to 36 months range. With respect to the current asset mandates of approximately $2.99 trillion of AUC/A that are yet to be installed as of December 31, 2024, we expect the conversion will mostly occur over the coming 24 months, with approximately 60% expected to be installed in 2025 and approximately 30% in 2026, with the balance expected to be installed largely in 2027. The expected timing of these installations is subject to change due to a variety of factors, including adjusted implementation schedules agreed with clients, scope adjustments, and product and functionality changes.\n State Street Corporation | 64\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPricing\nThe industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. Consequently, no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing AUC/A wins, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A, once installed, can vary materially. On average, over the five years ended December 31, 2024, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (2)% annually, with the impact ranging from (2)% to (3)% in any given year and approximately (3)% and (2)% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the term of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. In 2024, the impact was primarily driven by several multi-year renewals of large strategic clients. The timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services and the amount of revenue generated may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services or process changes, the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors. These same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients.    \nHistorically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we estimate that approximately 60%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of AUC/A; another approximately 20%, on average, of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining approximately 20% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values. \nIn addition to the effects described above (i.e., client activity and asset flows, net new business and pricing) our servicing fee revenue in any period will vary depending on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients. The full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur, particularly in periods of higher volatility.\nTABLE 6: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND/OR ADMINISTRATION BY PRODUCT\n(1)(2)\n(In billions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n% Change\n2024 vs. 2023\n% Change\n2023 vs. 2022\nCollective funds, including ETFs\n$\n15,266\n \n$\n14,070 \n$\n12,261 \n9 \n%\n15 \n%\nMutual funds\n12,301\n \n11,009 \n9,610 \n12 \n15 \nPension products\n9,386\n \n8,352 \n7,734 \n12 \n8 \nInsurance and other products\n9,604\n \n8,379 \n7,138 \n15 \n17 \nTotal \n$\n46,557\n \n$\n41,810 \n$\n36,743 \n11 \n14 \nTABLE 7: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND/OR ADMINISTRATION BY ASSET CLASS\n(2)\n(In billions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n% Change\n2024 vs. 2023\n% Change\n2023 vs. 2022\nEquities\n$\n27,535\n \n$\n24,317 \n$\n20,575 \n13 \n%\n18 \n%\nFixed-income\n11,933\n \n11,043 \n10,318 \n8 \n7 \nShort-term and other investments\n7,089\n \n6,450 \n5,850 \n10 \n10 \nTotal \n$\n46,557\n \n$\n41,810 \n$\n36,743 \n11 \n14 \nTABLE 8: ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY AND/OR ADMINISTRATION BY GEOGRAPHY\n(2)(3)\n(In billions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n% Change\n2024 vs. 2023\n% Change\n2023 vs. 2022\nAmericas\n$\n33,284\n \n$\n29,951 \n$\n26,981 \n11 \n%\n11 \n%\nEurope/Middle East/Africa\n10,179\n \n8,913 \n7,136 \n14 \n25 \nAsia/Pacific\n3,094\n \n2,946 \n2,626 \n5 \n12 \nTotal\n$\n46,557\n \n$\n41,810 \n$\n36,743 \n11 \n14 \n(1) \nCertain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.\n(2) \nConsistent with past practice, AUC/A values for certain asset classes are based on a lag, typically one-month.\n(3) \nGeographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.\n State Street Corporation | 65\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAsset servicing mandates newly announced in 2024 totaled approximately $2.33 trillion of AUC/A. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $2.99 trillion as of December 31, 2024, which will be reflected in AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period. \nNew asset servicing mandates, including Alpha servicing mandates, may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, consents or assignments, approval of applicable boards, shareholders and customary regulatory approvals or other conditions, the failure to complete any of which will prevent the relevant mandate from being installed and serviced. New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose or anonymously reference. These excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods may include assets associated with acquisitions or structured transactions and are presented on a gross basis based on factors present on or about the time we determine the business to be won by us and are not updated based on subsequent developments, including changes in assets, market valuations, scope and, potentially, termination. Such assets therefore do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which from time to time may be significant.\nWith respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including back office services such as custody and safekeeping, transaction processing and trade settlement, fund administration, reporting and record keeping, security servicing, fund accounting, middle office services such as investment book of records, transaction management, loans, cash derivatives and collateral services, recordkeeping, client reporting and investment analytics, markets services such as FX trading services, liquidity solutions, currency and collateral management and securities finance, and front office services such as portfolio management solutions, risk analytics, scenario analysis, performance and attribution, trade order and execution management, pre-trade compliance and ESG investment tools. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the timing of installation, and the types of assets.\nAs previously disclosed, in early 2021, due to a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing clients is moving a significant portion of its ETF assets currently with State Street to one or more other providers. Prior to the commencement of the transition of assets, which began in 2022, we estimated that the financial impact of this transition represented approximately 1.9% of our 2021 total fee revenue. We began to see the impact of the transition on our fee revenue and income growth trends primarily towards the end of 2023, with the remainder expected to be realized through 2025 as the transition continues. On a full year run rate basis, we estimate that 2024 reflected approximately two-thirds of the revenue impact of the exiting business. We expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful to our business.\nManagement Fee Revenue\nManagement fees increased 13% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher average market levels and net inflows.\nManagement fees generated outside the United States were approximately 25% of total management fees in 2024, compared to approximately 26% of total management fees in 2023.\nManagement fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we report based on month-end valuations. Management fees for certain components of managed assets, such as ETFs, mutual funds and Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities, are affected by daily average valuations of AUM. Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. While certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients.\nAsset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee on AUM than for actively managed products. Actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable account’s performance. \n State Street Corporation | 66\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of December 31, 2024 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of business won and lost and client flows, that:\n•\nA 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and\n•\nChanges in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, will have a significantly smaller corresponding impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time.\nDaily averages, month-end averages and year-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue. Year-end indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Year-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.\nTABLE 9: ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT BY ASSET CLASS AND INVESTMENT APPROACH\n(In billions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n% Change\n2024 vs. 2023\n% Change\n2023 vs. 2022\nEquity:\n  Active\n$\n52\n \n$\n47 \n$\n54 \n11 \n%\n(13)\n%\n  Passive\n2,955\n \n2,466 \n2,075 \n20 \n19 \nTotal equity\n3,007\n \n2,513 \n2,129 \n20 \n18 \nFixed-income:\n  Active\n31\n \n71 \n83 \n(56)\n(14)\n  Passive\n585\n \n538 \n471 \n9 \n14 \nTotal fixed-income\n616\n \n609 \n554 \n1 \n10 \nCash\n(1)\n518\n \n467 \n376 \n11 \n24 \nMulti-asset-class solutions:\n  Active\n23\n \n21 \n28 \n10 \n(25)\n  Passive\n351\n \n289 \n181 \n21 \n60 \nTotal multi-asset-class solutions\n374\n \n310 \n209 \n21 \n48 \nAlternative investments\n(2)\n:\n  Active\n10\n \n11 \n35 \n(9)\n(69)\n  Passive\n(3)\n190\n \n192 \n178 \n(1)\n8 \nTotal alternative investments\n200\n \n203 \n213 \n(1)\n(5)\nTotal\n$\n4,715\n \n$\n4,102 \n$\n3,481 \n15 \n18 \n(1) \nIncludes both floating- and constant-net-asset-value portfolios held in commingled structures or separate accounts.\n(2) \nIncludes real estate investment trusts, currency and commodities, including SPDR® Gold Shares and SPDR® Gold MiniSharesSM Trust.

Indirect FX is designed to address FX trades that relate to the purchase, sale or holding of a security where clients chose their execution frequency (either hourly or once per day), allowing us to offer straight-through processing and a fully automated service.\nOur FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client FX transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors on our total FX trading revenues often differs from period to period. For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related FX revenue.\nOur clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their FX transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect FX trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our “Street FX” service. Street FX, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their FX execution strategy and automate the FX trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank.\nWe also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through “electronic FX services” and “other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue.”\n•\nElectronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute FX transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms (i.e., FX Connect, Currenex). These transactions generate revenue through a “click” fee.\n•\nOther trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: As our clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may choose to utilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or transact with our Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which are not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios.\nFund Connect is another one of our electronic trading platforms: it is a global trading, analytics and cash management tool with access to more than 400 money market funds from leading providers.\nSecurities Finance\nSecurities finance revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, increased 3% in 2024 compared to 2023, mainly due to higher client lending balances, partially offset by lower spreads primarily resulting from muted industry specials activity.\nOur securities finance business consists of three components:\n(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors managed investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we refer to as the State Street Global Advisors lending funds;\n(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and\n(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer to as our prime services business.\nSecurities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our share of the fee split.\nAs principal, our prime services business borrows securities from the lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. We act as principal when the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as principal, we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. While we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower.\nMarket influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities in future periods. In addition, the constantly evolving regulatory environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards, interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency lending or prime services businesses, the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods.\n State Street Corporation | 69\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSoftware and Processing Fees\nSoftware and processing fees revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, increased 9% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD.\nSoftware and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue, including fees from front office software and data and lending related and other fees.\nFront office software and data revenue, which primarily includes revenue from CRD, Alpha Data Platform and Alpha Data Services, increased 10% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to software-enabled revenue growth, partially offset by lower on-premises renewals.\nRevenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD is primarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and SaaS, including professional services such as consulting and implementation services, software support and maintenance. Approximately 50%-70% of revenue associated with a sale of software to be installed on-premises is recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license, with the percentage varying based on the length of the contract and other contractual terms. The remainder of revenue for on-premise installations is recognized over the length of the contract as maintenance and other services are provided. Upon renewal of an on-premises software contract, the same pattern of revenue recognition is followed with 50%-70% recognized upon renewal and the remaining balance recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue for a SaaS related arrangement, where the customer does not take possession of the software, is recognized over the term of the contract as services are provided. Upon renewal of a SaaS arrangement, revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided under the new contract. As a result of these differences in how portions of CRD revenue are accounted for, CRD revenue may vary more than other business units quarter to quarter.\nLending related and other fees increased 8% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting higher unfunded commitments primarily relating to our fund finance products. Lending related and other fees primarily consists of fee revenue associated with our fund finance, leveraged loans, municipal finance, insurance and stable value wrap businesses.\nOther Fee Revenue\nOther fee revenue includes market-related adjustments and income associated with other equity method investments.\nOther fee revenue increased $109 million in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily reflecting a $66 million gain on sale of an equity investment and the absence of the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation in the prior year period. \nAdditional information about fee revenue is provided under “Line of Business Information” included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\nNet Interest Income\nSee Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nNII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets, which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, loans, resale agreements and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.\nNIM represents the relationship between annualized FTE NII and average total interest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by dividing FTE NII by average interest-earning assets. Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earned from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to an FTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory income tax rates.\nNII increased 6% i\nn 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher investment securities yields and loan growth, partially offset by deposit mix shift towards interest-bearing deposits. \n State Street Corporation | 70\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSee Table 13: Average Balances and Interest Rates - Fully Taxable-Equivalent Basis, for the breakout of NII on a FTE basis for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nTABLE 13: AVERAGE BALANCES AND INTEREST RATES - FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS\n(1)\nYears Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Dollars in millions; fully taxable-equivalent basis)\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nRevenue/Expense\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nRevenue/Expense\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nRevenue/\nExpense\nRate\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks\n$\n88,754\n \n$\n3,634\n \n4.09\n \n%\n$\n69,883 \n$\n2,869 \n4.11 \n%\n$\n76,498 \n$\n842 \n1.10 \n%\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements\n(2)\n6,789\n \n686\n \n10.10\n \n1,764 \n312 \n17.67 \n2,116 \n188 \n8.88 \nTrading account assets\n782\n \n—\n \n—\n \n711 \n— \n— \n721 \n— \n0.01 \nInvestment securities:\nInvestment securities available for sale\n53,572\n \n2,682\n \n5.01\n \n42,850 \n1,748 \n4.08 \n53,613 \n733 \n1.37 \nInvestment securities held-to-maturity\n51,212\n \n1,090\n \n2.13\n \n62,915 \n1,262 \n2.01 \n58,316 \n979 \n1.68 \nTotal Investment securities\n104,784\n \n3,772\n \n3.60\n \n105,765 \n3,010 \n2.85 \n111,929 \n1,712 \n1.53 \nLoans\n39,660\n \n2,272\n \n5.73\n \n34,800 \n1,863 \n5.35 \n35,117 \n973 \n2.77 \nOther interest-earning assets\n(3)\n25,300\n \n1,616\n \n6.39\n \n18,098 \n1,131 \n6.25 \n20,850 \n383 \n1.84 \nTotal interest-earning assets\n266,069\n \n11,980\n \n4.50\n \n231,021 \n9,185 \n3.98 \n247,231 \n4,098 \n1.66 \nCash and due from banks\n3,674\n \n3,925 \n3,652 \nOther non-interest-earning assets\n41,980\n \n39,750 \n35,547 \nTotal assets\n$\n311,723\n \n$\n274,696 \n$\n286,430 \nInterest-bearing deposits:\nU.S.\n$\n135,898\n \n$\n5,532\n \n4.07\n \n%\n$\n110,204 \n$\n3,976 \n3.61 \n%\n$\n98,252 \n$\n887 \n0.90 \n%\nNon-U.S.\n64,144\n \n1,095\n \n1.71\n \n62,689 \n1,015 \n1.62 \n76,842 \n80 \n0.10 \nTotal interest-bearing deposits\n(4)(5)\n200,042\n \n6,627\n \n3.31\n \n172,893 \n4,991 \n2.89 \n175,094 \n967 \n0.55 \nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements\n3,163\n \n156\n \n4.93\n \n3,904 \n34 \n0.87 \n3,633 \n14 \n0.39 \nFederal funds purchased\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n65 \n3 \n4.82 \n— \n— \n— \nOther short-term borrowings\n11,425\n \n577\n \n5.05\n \n1,120 \n40 \n3.60 \n1,188 \n26 \n2.18 \nLong-term debt\n20,394\n \n1,086\n \n5.32\n \n17,355 \n888 \n5.12 \n14,132 \n376 \n2.66 \nOther interest-bearing liabilities\n(6)\n4,826\n \n608\n \n12.59\n \n3,891 \n465 \n11.96 \n2,725 \n161 \n5.91 \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n239,850\n \n9,054\n \n3.77\n \n199,228 \n6,421 \n3.22 \n196,772 \n1,544 \n0.78 \nNon-interest-bearing deposits\n(5)\n25,569\n \n32,218 \n47,780 \nOther non-interest-bearing liabilities\n21,192\n \n19,073 \n15,992 \nPreferred shareholders’ equity\n2,773\n \n1,976 \n1,976 \nCommon shareholders’ equity\n22,339\n \n22,201 \n23,910 \nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity\n$\n311,723\n \n$\n274,696 \n$\n286,430 \nExcess of rate earned over rate paid\n0.73\n \n%\n0.75 \n%\n0.87 \n%\nNet interest income, fully taxable-equivalent basis\n$\n2,926\n \n$\n2,764 \n$\n2,554 \nNet interest margin, fully taxable-equivalent basis\n1.10\n \n%\n1.20 \n%\n1.03 \n%\nTax-equivalent adjustment\n(3)\n(5)\n(10)\nNet interest income, GAAP basis \n$\n2,923\n \n$\n2,759 \n$\n2,544 \n(1)\n Rates earned/paid on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge activities associated with our asset and liability management activities where applicable.\n(2)\n Reflects the impact of balance sheet netting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately \n$191.26 billion\n, $140.36 billion and $71.02 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Additional information about the components of interest income and interest expense is provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nAverage total interest-earning assets were $266.07 billion\n in 2024\n compared to $231.02 billion in 2023. \nThe increase is primarily due to higher levels of client deposits and an increase in short-term wholesale funding. \nInterest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $88.75 billion\n \nin 2024 compared to $69.88 billion in 2023. These \ndeposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) and other non-U.S. central banks. The higher levels of average cash balances reflect higher levels of client deposits and funding levels.\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements averaged $6.79 billion in 2024 compared to $1.76 billion in 2023, due to a shift to term repurchase agreements, which reduces our ability to net against resale agreement balances. Additionally, as a member of FICC, we may net securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization when specific netting criteria are met. The impact of balance sheet netting was $191.26 billion on average in 2024\n \ncompared to $140.36 billion in 2023, primarily driven by an increase in FICC repurchase agreement volumes.\nWe are a direct and sponsoring member of FICC. As a sponsoring member within FICC, we enter into repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and with other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC Government Securities Division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with FICC, backed by our guarantee to FICC of the prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients’ respective obligations. We generally obtain a security interest from our sponsored clients in the high quality securities collateral that they receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to FICC.\nAdditionally, as a member of certain industry clearing and settlement exchanges, we may be required to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization and provide liquidity support in the event of the default of another member to the extent that the defaulting member’s clearing fund obligation and the prescribed loss allocation to FICC is depleted. It is difficult to estimate our maximum possible exposure under the membership agreement, \nsince this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against us that have not yet occurred. We did not record any liabilities under these arrangements as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAverage investment securities were \n$104.78 billion in 2024 compared to $105.77 billion in 2023. While the overall size of the portfolio was relatively flat in 2024 compared to 2023, it included higher U.S. Treasury securities\n, offset by lower mortgage-backed and non-U.S. sovereign and supranational securities.\nAverage loans increased to \n$39.66 billion in 2024 compared to $34.80 billion in 2023. Average core loans, which exclude overdrafts and highlight our \nefforts to grow our lending portfolio, averaged $36.14 billion in 2024 compared to $30.97 billion in 2023. The increase is primarily due to growth in CLOs in loan form and fund finance loans. Additional information about these loans is provided in\n Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nAverage other interest-ea\nrning assets, largely associated with our prime service business, increased to \n$25.30 billion\n in 2024 from $18.10 billion in 2023, primarily driven by an increase in the level of cash collateral posted. Other interest-earning assets primarily reflects prime services assets where cash has been posted to \nborrow securities from lenders, which are then lent by us, as principal, to borrowers. This cash includes both cash from borrowers and cash utilized from our balance sheet, and is presented on a net basis on the balance sheet where we have enforceable netting agreements. Non-interest earning assets also includes a portion of our prime services assets where borrower-provided non-cash collateral has been utilized to borrow securities from lenders, which we subsequently loan, as principal, to our borrowers; in this structure our investment portfolio securities are encumbered, but this is not reflected on the balance sheet. Combined with our prime servic\nes liabilities, revenue from these activities generates securities finance fee revenue as well as net interest income. \nAverage total interest-bearing deposits increased to $200.04 billion in 2024 from $172.89 billion in 2023. The increase is driven by active engagement with our clients, rotation from non-interest bearing deposits and a reduction in the Federal Reserve’s overnight repurchase agreement activity. Future interest-bearing deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client behavior, the mix of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits and market conditions, including the general levels of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates.\n State Street Corporation | 72\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAverage o\nther short-term borrowings increased to $11.43 billion in 2024 from $1.12 billion in 2023, due to increased wholesale funding. The increase is driven by our effort to diversify our funding sources through relatively low-cost channels, to further support business growth.\nAverage long-term debt was $20.39 billion in 2024 compared to $17.36 billion in 2023. These amounts reflect issuances, redemptions and maturities of senior and subordinated debt during the respective periods.\nAverage other interest-bearing liabilities, largely associated with our prime services business, were $4.83 billion in 2024 compared to $3.89 billion in 2023. Other interest-bearing liabilities is primarily driven by cash received from our custody clients, which is presented on a net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements. Non-interest bearing liabilities also include a portion of our prime services liabilities where client-provided non-cash collateral has been received and we have rehypothecation rights. Securities received as collateral from our custody clients where we have no rehypothecation rights are used as a credit mitigant only and remain off balance sheet. \nSeveral factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM, including the volume and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet management activities; changes in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured; and changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend.\nBased on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards, we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as federal agency MBS, sovereign debt securities and U.S. Tre\nasury and agency securities. The pace at which we reinvest, and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nIn 2024, we recorded a \n$75 million\n provision for credit losses, primarily reflecting an increase in loan loss reserves associated with certain commercial real \nestate and leveraged loans, compared to $46 million in 2023.\n Additional information is provided under “Loans” in “Financial Condition” in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nExpenses\nTable 14: Expenses, provides t\nhe breakout of expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Total expenses decreased 1% \ncompared to 2023, as higher business investments, as well as revenue and performance-related costs, were more than offset by productivity savings from organizational simplification, process improvements and other initiatives, including from the joint venture consolidations in India and the net impact of notable items. The net impact of notable items in the current and prior year periods decreased expenses by 5% points in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nTABLE 14: EXPENSES\nYears Ended December 31,\n% Change  2024 vs. 2023\n% Change  2023 vs. 2022\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCompensation and employee benefits\n$\n4,697\n \n$\n4,744 \n$\n4,428 \n(1)\n%\n7 \n%\nInformation systems and communications\n1,829\n \n1,703 \n1,630 \n7\n4 \nTransaction processing services\n998\n \n957 \n971 \n4 \n(1)\nOccupancy\n437\n \n426 \n394 \n3 \n8 \nAmortization of other intangible assets\n230\n \n239 \n238 \n(4)\n— \nAcquisition and restructuring costs\n—\n \n(15)\n65 \nnm\nnm\nOther:\nProfessional services\n465\n \n428 \n375 \n9 \n14 \nOther\n874\n \n1,101 \n700 \n(21)\n57 \nTotal other\n1,339\n \n1,529 \n1,075 \n(12)\n42 \nTotal expenses\n$\n9,530\n \n$\n9,583 \n$\n8,801 \n(1)\n9 \nNumber of employees at year-end\n52,626\n \n46,451 \n42,226 \n13 \n10 \nCompensation and employee benefits expenses decreased 1% in 2024 compared to 2023, as higher performance-based incentive compensation and employee benefits were more than offset by ongoing organizational simplification, process improvements and other initiatives, as well as net benefits from the joint venture consolidations in India and lower net impact of notable items. The net impact of notable items in the current and prior year periods decreased compensation and employee benefits expenses by 3% points in 2024 as compared to 2023. \nTotal headcount increased 13% as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting the consolidation of our second joint venture in India in the second quarter of 2024. Associated headcount cost was previously reflected in compensation and employee benefits expenses. \n State Street Corporation | 73\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInformation systems and communications expenses increased 7% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily reflecting higher technology and infrastructure investments, the absence of episodic vendor credits and notable items, partially offset by vendor savings initiatives and optimization savings. The absence of the prior year notable items decreased information systems and communications expenses by 3% points in 2024, as compared to 2023.\nTransaction processing services expenses increased 4% in 2024 compared to 2023,  primarily due to higher revenue-related costs associated with sub-custody, broker fees and market data costs.\nOccupancy expenses increased 3% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by footprint expansion related to the joint venture consolidations in India, partially offset by footprint optimization and one-time vendor credits. \nAmortization of other intangible assets \ndecreased 4%\n in 2024 compared to 2023.\nOther expenses decreased 12% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the FDIC special assessment notable items in the current and prior year periods, partially offset by higher professional services, and higher sales, marketing and other fund related expenses.\nRepositioning Charges\nIn 2024, we recorded a net repositioning release of $2 million, including a $15 million release reflected in compensation and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by $13 million of occupancy charges related to footprint optimization.\nIn 2023, we recorded net repositioning charges of approximately $203 million to enable the next phase of our productivity efforts to streamline operations and technology, and improve efficiency. Expenses for 2023 included $182 million of compensation and employee benefits expenses related to workforce rationalization and $21 million of occupancy costs related to real estate footprint optimization.\nThe following table presents aggregate activity for repositioning charges for the periods indicated:\nTABLE 15: REPOSITIONING CHARGES\n(In millions)\nEmployee\nRelated Costs\nReal Estate\nActions\nTotal\nAccrual Balance at December 31, 2021\n$\n68 \n$\n6 \n$\n74 \nAccruals for Repositioning Charges\n58 \n20 \n78 \nPayments and other adjustments\n(43)\n(21)\n(64)\nAccrual Balance at December 31, 2022\n83 \n5 \n88 \nAccruals for Repositioning Charges\n182 \n21 \n203 \nPayments and other adjustments\n(58)\n(25)\n(83)\nAccrual Balance at December 31, 2023\n207 \n1 \n208 \nAccruals for Repositioning Charges\n(15)\n13\n \n(2)\nPayments and other adjustments\n(96)\n(14)\n(110)\nAccrual Balance at December 31, 2024\n$\n96\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n96\n \nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was \n$708 million\n in 2024 compared to $372 million in 2023.

Our clients’ needs and our operating objectives determine the volume, mix and currency denomination of our assets and liabilities. As our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment alternatives for our clients.\nDeposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. Our assets consist primarily of securities held in our AFS or HTM portfolios and short-duration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.\nAdditional information on our financial condition is presented in Table 13: Average Balances and Interest Rates - Fully Taxable-Equivalent Basis. We believe the average statement of condition is a better measure of the balance sheet trends as period-end balances can be impacted by the timing of client activities including deposits and withdrawals.\n State Street Corporation | 76\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInvestment Securities\nTABLE 18: CARRYING VALUES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nAs of December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAvailable-for-sale:\nU.S. Treasury and federal agencies:\nDirect obligations\n$\n23,525\n \n$\n8,301 \n$\n7,981 \nMortgage-backed securities\n(1)\n10,566\n \n10,755 \n8,509 \nTotal U.S. Treasury and federal agencies\n34,091\n \n19,056 \n16,490 \nNon-U.S. debt securities:\nMortgage-backed securities\n2,430\n \n1,857 \n1,623 \nAsset-backed securities\n(2)\n1,868\n \n2,137 \n1,669 \nNon-U.S. sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency\n13,939\n \n15,100 \n14,089 \nOther\n(3)\n2,821\n \n2,735 \n2,091 \nTotal non-U.S. debt securities\n21,058\n \n21,829 \n19,472 \nAsset-backed securities:\nStudent loans\n(4)\n \n90\n \n114 \n115 \nCollateralized loan obligations\n(5)\n3,453\n \n2,527 \n2,355 \nNon-agency CMBS and RMBS\n(6)\n4\n \n249 \n231 \nOther\n91\n \n90 \n88 \nTotal asset-backed securities\n3,638\n \n2,980 \n2,789 \nState and political subdivisions\n56\n \n355 \n823 \nOther U.S. debt securities\n(7)\n52\n \n306 \n1,005 \nTotal available-for-sale securities\n(8)(9)\n$\n58,895\n \n$\n44,526 \n$\n40,579 \nHeld-to-maturity:\nU.S. Treasury and federal agencies:\nDirect obligations\n$\n5,417\n \n$\n8,584 \n$\n11,693 \nMortgage-backed securities\n(10)\n36,101\n \n39,472 \n42,307 \nTotal U.S. Treasury and federal agencies\n41,518\n \n48,056 \n54,000 \nNon-U.S. debt securities:\nNon-U.S. sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency\n3,673\n \n5,757 \n6,603 \nTotal non-U.S. debt securities\n3,673\n \n5,757 \n6,603 \nAsset-backed securities:\nStudent loans\n(4)\n2,536\n \n3,298 \n3,955 \nNon-agency CMBS and RMBS\n(11)\n—\n \n6 \n142 \nTotal asset-backed securities\n2,536\n \n3,304 \n4,097 \nTotal held-to-maturity securities\n(8)(12)\n$\n47,727\n \n$\n57,117 \n$\n64,700 \n(1)\n As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the total fair value included $4.36 billion, $5.54 billion and $6.78 billion, respectively, of agency CMBS and $6.20 billion, $5.21 billion and $1.73 billion, respectively, of agency MBS.\n(2) \nAs of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the fair value includes non-U.S. collateralized loan obligations of $0.70 billion, $1.02 billion and $0.86 billion, respectively. \n(3)\n As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the fair value includes non-U.S. corporate bonds of $2.54 billion, $2.36 billion and $1.14 billion, respectively.\n(4)\n Primarily comprised of securities guaranteed by the federal government with respect to at least \n97%\n of defaulted principal and accrued interest on the underlying loans. \n(5)\n Excludes collateralized loan obligations in loan form.

private equity capital call finance loans, $8.09 billion loans to real money funds and $1.44 billion loans to business development companies as of December 31, 2024, compared to $9.69 billion and $7.57 billion private equity capital call finance loans, $6.63 billion and $6.61 billion loans to real money funds and $1.05 billion and $1.11 billion loans to business development companies as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(3) \nIncludes $3.01 billion securities finance loans and $214 million loans to municipalities as of December 31, 2024, $2.23 billion securities finance loans, $276 million loans to municipalities and $5 million other loans as of December 31, 2023 and $1.51 billion securities finance loans, $321 million loans to municipalities and $42 million other loans as of December 31, 2022.\n(4) \nAs of December 31, 2024, excluding overdrafts, floating rate loans totaled $38.46 billion and fixed rate loans totaled $2.76 billion. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with EURIBOR indexed floating-rate loans. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for additional details.\nWe sold $300 million of total loans, which consisted of $250 million of leveraged loans and $50 million of commercial real estate loans in 2024.\nWe had binding unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 of $104 million and $121 million, respectively, to participate in syndications of leveraged loans. Additional information about these unfunded commitments is provided in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nThese leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative” under our internal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K), are externally rated “BBB,” “BB” or “B,” with approximately 91% and 92% of the loans rated “BB” or “B” as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our investment strategy involves generally limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global \nfinancial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential investment and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment. However, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans in our portfolio. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the commercial real estate portfolio consists of, by asset class, approximately 38% multifamily residential, 36% office buildings and 26% other asset classes, and the portfolio does not have any construction exposure. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, the commercial real estate loans are on properties located in multiple markets across the United States, with no significant concentrations (New York Metro is the largest concentration at approximately 17%). Despite not having a significant concentration in any one market, a material decline in real estate markets or economic conditions could negatively impact the value or performance of one or more individual properties, which could adversely impact timely loan repayment, which may result in increased provisions for credit losses. We observed these effects in certain commercial real estate loans during 2024, resulting in additional provisions for credit losses. Were conditions, or our evaluation of conditions, in those or other markets to worsen during 2025 or subsequent periods, we may increase our allowance for credit losses during those periods.\nAdditional information about all of our loan segments, as well as underlying classes, is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nTABLE 26: CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES FOR LOANS\nAs of December 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nUnder 1 year\n1 to 5 years\n5 to 15 years\nTotal\nDomestic:\nCommercial and financial\n$\n15,280\n \n$\n5,928\n \n$\n2,359\n \n$\n23,567\n \nCommercial real estate\n217\n \n1,732\n \n893\n \n2,842\n \nTotal domestic\n15,497\n \n7,660\n \n3,252\n \n26,409\n \nForeign:\nCommercial and financial\n5,752\n \n2,318\n \n8,721\n \n16,791\n \nTotal foreign\n5,752\n \n2,318\n \n8,721\n \n16,791\n \nTotal loans \n$\n21,249\n \n$\n9,978\n \n$\n11,973\n \n$\n43,200\n \n State Street Corporation | 80\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTABLE 27: CLASSIFICATION OF LOAN BALANCES DUE AFTER ONE YEAR\nAs of December 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nLoans with predetermined interest rates\nLoans with floating or adjustable interest rates\nDomestic:\nCommercial and financial\n$\n161\n \n$\n8,126\n \nCommercial real estate\n2,332\n \n293\n \nTotal domestic\n2,493\n \n8,419\n \nForeign:\nCommercial and financial\n—\n \n11,038\n \nTotal foreign\n—\n \n11,038\n \nTotal loans\n$\n2,493\n \n$\n19,457\n \nAllowance for credit losses\nTABLE 28: ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nYears Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAllowance for credit  losses:\nBeginning balance\n$\n150\n \n$\n121 \n$\n108 \nProvision for credit losses (funded commitments)\n(1)\n81\n \n56 \n16 \nProvisions for credit losses (unfunded commitments)\n(5)\n(9)\n4 \nProvisions for credit losses (investment securities and all other)\n(1)\n(1)\n— \nCharge-offs\n(2)\n(42)\n(17)\n(7)\nEnding balance\n$\n183\n \n$\n150 \n$\n121 \n(1)\n The provision for credit losses is primarily related to commercial real estate and leveraged loans.\n(2)\n The charge-offs are primarily related to leveraged loans and a commercial real estate loan.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses increased $33 million compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting provision for credit losses of $75 million primarily due to an increase in loan loss reserves associated with certain commercial real estate and leveraged loans, partially offset by charge-offs of $42 million, largely related to a single property in the commercial real estate portfolio and certain leveraged loans.\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately $68 million of our allowance for credit losses was related to leveraged loans included in the commercial and financial segment and $102 million was related to commercial real estate loans, compared to $72 million and $60 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. The remaining $13 million and $18 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was related to other loans, off-balance sheet commitments, interest-bearing deposits with banks and other financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities. As of December 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses represented 0.4% of total loans.\nAs our view on current and future economic conditions changes, our allowance for credit losses related to these loans may be impacted through a change to the provisions for credit losses, reflecting \nfactors such as credit migration within our loan portfolio, as well as changes in management’s economic outlook.\nAdditional information with respect to the allowance for credit losses, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses related to investment securities, is provided in “Allowance for Credit Losses” under Significant Accounting Estimates and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nOverview\nIn the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some that are inherent in the financial services industry, and others that are more specific to our business activities. Our risk management framework focuses on material risks, which include the following:\n•\ncredit and counterparty risk;\n•\nliquidity risk, including funding and management; \n•\noperational risk;\n•\ninformation technology risk;\n•\nresiliency risk; \n•\nmarket risk associated with our trading activities;\n•\nmarket risk associated with our non-trading activities, referred to as asset and liability management, consisting primarily of interest rate risk; \n•\nmodel risk;\n•\nstrategic risk; and \n•\nreputational, compliance, fiduciary and business conduct risk. \nMany of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each of them, could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, and are discussed in detail under “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.\nThe identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of risks are essential to our financial performance and successful management of our businesses. Accordingly, the scope of our business requires that we consider these risks as part of a comprehensive and well-integrated risk management function. \nThese risks, if not effectively managed, can result in losses to us as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. Our approach to risk management, including Board and senior management oversight and a system of policies, procedures, limits, risk measurement and monitoring and internal controls, allows for an assessment of \n State Street Corporation | 81\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nrisks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return. \nOur objective is to optimize our returns while operating at a prudent level of risk. In support of this objective, we have instituted a risk appetite framework that aligns our business strategy and financial objectives with the level of risk that we are willing to incur.\nWe manage risk with a focus on the following objectives:\n•\nA culture of risk awareness that extends across all of our business activities;\n•\nThe identification, classification and quantification of our material risks;\n•\nThe establishment of our risk appetite and associated limits and policies, and our compliance with these limits;\n•\nThe establishment of a risk management structure that enables the control and coordination of risk-taking across the business lines;\n•\nThe implementation of stress testing practices and a dynamic risk-assessment capability (additional information with respect to our stress-testing process and practices is provided under “Capital” in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis); \n•\nA direct link between risk and strategic decision-making processes and incentive compensation practices; and\n•\nThe overall flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing business and market conditions.\nOur risk appetite framework outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define the level and type of risk we are willing to undertake in the course of executing our business strategy, and also serves as a guide in setting risk limits across our business units. It further defines responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits, and for reporting, escalating, approving and addressing exceptions. Our risk appetite framework is established by ERM, a corporate risk oversight group, in conjunction with the MRAC and the RC of the Board. The Board formally reviews and approves our risk appetite statement annually, or more frequently in response to shifts in endogenous or exogenous risk conditions. \nGovernance and Structure\nOur approach to risk management involves all levels of management, from the Board and its committees, including its E&A Committee, the RC, the \nHuman Resources Committee (HRC) and the TOPS, to each business unit and employee. We allocate responsibility for risk oversight so that risk/return decisions are made under a process designed to place appropriate personnel in positions of decision-making authority and subject to robust review and challenge.\nRisk management is the responsibility of each employee, and is implemented through three lines of defense: \n•\nThe business units, which own and manage the risks inherent in their business, are considered the first line of defense; \n•\nERM and other support functions, such as Compliance, Finance and Vendor Management, provide the second line of defense; and \n•\nCorporate Audit is the third line of defense, reports to the E&A committee of the Board and is independent from the business units, ERM and other corporate functions. Corporate Audit provides independent assurance to the Board over the design and operating effectiveness of key internal controls included within the risk management framework.\nThe responsibilities for effective review and challenge reside with senior managers, management oversight committees, Corporate Audit and, ultimately, the Board and its committees. \nCorporate-level risk committees provide focused oversight, and establish corporate standards and policies for specific risks, including credit, country, market, liquidity, operational, cyber, information technology as well as new business products, regulatory compliance and ethics, vendor risk and model risks. These committees have been delegated the responsibility to develop recommendations and remediation strategies to address issues that affect or have the potential to affect us.\nWe maintain a risk governance committee structure which serves as the formal governance mechanism through which we seek to undertake the consistent identification, management and mitigation of various risks facing us in connection with our business activities. This governance structure is enhanced and integrated through multi-disciplinary involvement, particularly through ERM. The following chart presents this structure.\nWhile our risk management program is designed to manage the risks in our businesses, internal and external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated.\n State Street Corporation | 82\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nBoard Committee Risk Governance Structure\nBoard Committees:\nRisk Committee (RC)\nExamining & Audit Committee \n(E&A Committee)\nHuman Resources Committee (HRC)\nTechnology and Operations Committee \n(TOPS)\nManagement Risk Governance Committee Structure\nExecutive Management Committees:\nManagement Risk and Capital Committee\n(MRAC)\nBusiness Conduct and Compliance Committee\n(BCCC)\nTechnology and Operational Risk Committee\n(TORC)\nRisk Committees:\nAsset-Liability Committee (ALCO)\nFinancial Risk Committee (FRC)\nFiduciary Risk Committee\nOperational Risk and Controls Committee\nTechnology Risk Committee\nRecovery and Resolution Planning (RRP) Executive Review Board\nBasel Oversight Committee \n(BOC)\nCompliance Program Oversight Committee\nThird Party and Outsourcing Risk Committee\nEnterprise Resilience Risk Committee\nStress-Testing Steering Committee\nModel Risk Committee \n(MRC)\nConduct Standards Committee\nExecutive Operations Management Committee\nEnterprise Data Management Committee\nCountry Risk Committee\nSSGA Risk Committee\nLegal Entity Oversight Committee\nRegulatory Reporting Oversight Committee\nNew Business and Product Committee\nIncentive Compensation Control Committee\nGlobal Financial Crimes Compliance Committee\n State Street Corporation | 83\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEnterprise Risk Management\nThe goal of ERM is to ensure that risks are proactively identified, well-understood and prudently managed in support of our business strategy. ERM provides risk oversight, support and coordination to allow for the consistent identification, measurement and management of risks across business units separate from the business units’ activities, and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of corporate-wide risk management policies and guidelines. \nRisk identification and assessments serve to enable ERM’s understanding of business unit strategy, risk profile, and potential exposures and support the management of risk. This is achieved through a series of risk assessments across our business using techniques for the identification, assessment, and measurement of risk across a spectrum of potential frequency and severity combinations, including business-specific programs to identify, assess and measure risk, such as new business and product review and approval, new client screening, and, as deemed appropriate, targeted risk assessments. Two primary risk assessment programs, which are supplemented by other business-specific programs, are the core of this component:\n•\nThe Material Risk Identification process utilizes a bottom-up approach to identify our most significant risk exposures across on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities. The program is designed to consider risks that could have a material impact irrespective of their likelihood or frequency. This can include risks that may have an impact on longer-term business objectives, such as significant change management activities or long-term strategic initiatives.\n•\nThe Risk and Control Self-Assessment program comprises a structured process to identify, assess, and manage non-financial risks (operational and compliance) within our business lines and support functions. See also “Operational Risk Management” below.\nIn addition, ERM establishes and reviews limits and, in collaboration with business unit management, monitors key risks. Ultimately, ERM works to validate that risk-taking occurs within the risk appetite statement approved by the Board and conforms to associated risk policies, limits and guidelines.\nThe CRO is responsible for our risk management globally, leads ERM and has a dual reporting line to our CEO and the Board’s RC.\nBoard Committees\nThe Board has four committees which assist it in discharging its responsibilities with respect to risk management: the RC, the E&A Committee, the HRC and the TOPS.\n•\nThe RC is responsible for oversight related to the operation of our global risk management framework, including policies and procedures establishing risk management governance and processes and risk control infrastructure. It is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our assessment and management of all risks applicable to our operations, including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, regulatory, technology, business, compliance and reputation risks, and related policies. In addition, the RC provides oversight of capital policies, capital planning and balance sheet management, resolution planning and monitors capital adequacy in relation to risk. It is also responsible for discharging the duties and obligations of the Board under applicable Basel and other regulatory requirements.\n•\nThe E&A Committee oversees management’s operation of our comprehensive system of internal controls covering the integrity of our consolidated financial statements and reports, compliance with laws, regulations and corporate policies. The E&A Committee acts on behalf of the Board in monitoring and overseeing the performance of Corporate Audit and in reviewing certain communications with banking regulators. The E&A Committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention, evaluation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm, including sole authority for the establishment of pre-approval policies and procedures for all audit engagements and any non-audit engagements.\n•\nThe HRC has direct responsibility for the oversight of human capital management, all compensation plans, policies and programs in which executive officers participate and incentive, retirement, welfare as well as equity plans in which certain of our other employees participate. In addition, it oversees the alignment of our incentive compensation arrangements with our safety and soundness, including the integration of risk management objectives, and related policies, arrangements and control processes \n State Street Corporation | 84\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nconsistent with applicable related regulatory rules and guidance.\n•\nThe TOPS leads and assists in the Board’s oversight of technology and operational risk management and the role of these risks, including cyber risk, in executing our strategy and supporting our global business requirements. The TOPS reviews strategic initiatives from a technology and operational risk perspective and reviews and approves technology-related risk matters. In addition, the TOPS reviews matters related to corporate information security and cybersecurity programs, and their related risks, operational and technology resiliency, data and access management and third-party risk management.\nExecutive Management Committees\nMRAC\n is the senior management decision-making body for risk and capital issues, and oversees our financial risks, our consolidated statement of condition, and our capital adequacy, liquidity and recovery and resolution planning. Its responsibilities include:\n•\nThe approval of our global risk policies, capital and liquidity management frameworks, including our risk appetite framework;\n•\nThe monitoring and assessment of our capital adequacy based on internal policies and regulatory requirements;\n•\nThe oversight of our firm-wide risk identification, model risk governance, stress testing and Recovery and Resolution Planning programs; and\n•\nThe ongoing monitoring and review of risks undertaken within the businesses, and our senior management oversight and approval of risk strategies and tactics.\nMRAC\n is co-chaired by our CRO and Chief Financial Officer, who regularly present to the RC on developments in the risk environment and performance trends in our key business areas.\nBCCC\n provides oversight of the management of culture, conduct and compliance risks, including culture and conduct programs, frameworks and compliance risk exposures that could result in reputational risk. The BCCC is co-chaired by our Chief Compliance Officer and our General Counsel.\nTORC\n provides oversight and assesses the effectiveness of enterprise-wide technology and operational risk management programs. TORC also reviews areas of improvement to manage and control technology and operational risk consistently across \nthe organization. TORC is co-chaired by the Chief Operating Officer and the CRO.\nRisk Committees\nThe following second line risk committees, under the oversight of the respective executive management committees, have focused responsibilities for oversight of specific areas of risk management:\nManagement Risk and Capital Committee\n•\nALCO \nis the senior corporate oversight and decision-making body for balance sheet strategy, Global Treasury business activities and risk management for interest rate risk, liquidity risk and non-trading market risk.

We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading activities, such as securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal securities lending and FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities\n \nand other settlement operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions and fees receivables.\nWe distinguish between three major types of credit risk:\n•\nDefault risk\n - the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its contractual payment obligations;\n•\nCountry risk\n - the risk that we may suffer a loss, in any given country, due to any of the following reasons: deterioration of economic conditions, political and social upheaval, nationalization and appropriation of assets, government repudiation of indebtedness, exchange controls and disruptive currency depreciation or devaluation; and \n•\nSettlement risk\n - the risk that the settlement or clearance of transactions will fail, which arises whenever the exchange of cash, securities or other assets is not simultaneous.\nThe acceptance of credit risk by us is governed by corporate policies and guidelines, which include standardized procedures applied across the entire organization. These policies and guidelines include specific requirements related to each counterparty’s risk profile; the markets served; counterparty, industry and country concentrations; and regulatory compliance. These policies and procedures also implement a number of core principles, which include the following:\n•\nWe measure and consolidate credit risks attributed to each counterparty, or group of counterparties, in accordance with a “one-obligor” principle that aggregates risks across our business units;\n•\nERM reviews and approves all material extensions of credit, and material changes to such extensions of credit (such as changes in term, collateral structure or covenants), in accordance with assigned credit-approval authorities;\n•\nCredit-approval authorities are assigned to individuals according to their qualifications, experience and training, and these authorities are periodically reviewed. Our largest exposures require approval by the Credit Committee, a subcommittee of the FRC. With respect to small and low-risk extensions of credit to certain types of counterparties, approval authority may be granted to individuals outside of ERM;\n•\nWe seek to avoid or limit undue concentrations of risk. Counterparty (or groups of counterparties), industry, country and product-specific concentrations of risk are subject to frequent review and approval in accordance with our risk policies and appetite;\n•\nWe evaluate the creditworthiness of counterparties through a detailed risk assessment, including the use of internal risk-rating methodologies; \n•\nWe review all extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of counterparties at least annually. The nature and extent of these reviews are determined by the size, nature and term of the extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and\n•\nWe subject all corporate policies and guidelines to annual review as an integral part of our periodic assessment of our risk appetite.\nOur corporate policies and guidelines require that all extensions of credit are consistent with the bank’s standards, limit credit-related losses, and our goal of maintaining a strong financial condition.\nStructure and Organization\nThe Credit Risk group within ERM is responsible for the assessment, approval and monitoring of credit risk across our business. The group is managed centrally, has dedicated teams in a number of locations worldwide, and is responsible for related policies and procedures, and for our internal credit-rating systems and methodologies. In addition, the group, in conjunction with the business units, establishes measurements and limits to control the amount of credit risk accepted across its various business activities, both at the portfolio level and for each individual counterparty or group of counterparties, to individual sectors, and also to \n State Street Corporation | 87\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ncounterparties by product and country of risk. These measurements and limits are reviewed periodically, or at least annually.\nIn conjunction with other groups in ERM, the Credit Risk group is responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of our credit risk measurement and management systems, including data and assessment systems, quantification systems and the reporting framework.\nVarious key committees within our company are responsible for the oversight of credit risk and associated credit risk policies, systems and models. All credit-related activities are governed by our risk appetite framework and our credit risk guidelines, which define our general philosophy with respect to credit risk and the manner in which we control, manage and monitor such risks.\nFRC and it's sub-committee, Credit Committee have the primary responsibility for the oversight, review and approval of the credit risk guidelines and policies which are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.\nThe Credit Committee, a subcommittee of the FRC, has responsibility for assigning credit authority and approving the largest and higher-risk extensions of credit to individual counterparties or groups of counterparties.\nFRC provides periodic updates to MRAC and the Board’s RC.\nCredit Ratings \nWe perform initial and ongoing reviews to exercise due diligence on the creditworthiness of our counterparties when conducting any business with them or approving any credit limits.\nThis due diligence process generally includes the assignment of an internal credit rating, which is determined by the use of internally developed and validated methodologies, scorecards and a 15-grade rating scale. This risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment; qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a replicable manner and, following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our rating scale is assigned. We generally rate our counterparties individually, although some counterparties defined by us as low-risk are rated on a pooled basis. Credit ratings are reviewed and approved by the Credit Risk group or its delegates. We evaluate and rate the credit risk of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. To facilitate comparability across the portfolio, counterparties within a given sector are rated using a risk-rating tool developed for that sector.\nOur risk-rating models are subject to periodic internal review and validation. The overall risk rating \nmethodology is reviewed and approved by the Credit Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the FRC, on an annual basis. \nRisk Parameter Estimates\nOur internal risk-rating system promotes a clear and consistent approach to determining appropriate credit risk classifications for our credit counterparties and exposures. This allows us to track the changes in risk associated with these counterparties and exposures over time. This capability enhances our ability to calculate both risk exposures and capital, and enables better strategic decision-making across the organization.\nMore specifically, our internal risk rating system is used for the following purposes:\n•\nThe assessment of the creditworthiness of new counterparties and, in conjunction with our risk appetite statement, the development of appropriate credit limits for our products and services, including loans, foreign exchange, securities finance, placements and repurchase agreements;\n•\nThe automation of limit approvals for certain low-risk counterparties, as defined in our credit risk guidelines and based on the counterparty’s probability-of-default;\n•\nThe development of approval authority matrices based on PD; riskier counterparties with higher PDs require higher levels of approval for a comparable PD and limit size compared to less risky counterparties with lower PDs;\n•\nThe analysis of risk concentration trends using historical PD and exposure-at-default (EAD), data;\n•\nThe determination of the level of management review of short-duration advances depending on PD; riskier counterparties with higher rating class values generally trigger higher levels of management escalation for comparable short-duration advances compared to less risky counterparties with lower rating-class values;\n•\nThe monitoring of credit facility utilization levels using EAD values and the identification of instances where counterparties have exceeded limits;\n•\nThe aggregation and comparison of counterparty exposures with risk appetite levels to determine if businesses are maintaining appropriate risk levels; and\n•\nThe determination of our regulatory capital requirements for the AIRB set forth in the Basel framework.\n State Street Corporation | 88\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCredit Risk Mitigation\nWe seek to limit our credit exposure and reduce any potential credit losses through the use of various types of credit risk mitigation. The Basel III final rule permits us to reflect the application of credit risk mitigation when it meets the standards outlined therein. Examples of forms of credit risk mitigation include a security interest in financial and non-financial assets (collateral), netting and guarantees. Where permissible, we apply the recognition of collateral, guarantees and netting to mitigate overall risk within our counterparty credit portfolio. While credit default swaps are permitted under the Basel III final rule, we do not actively use credit default swaps as a risk mitigation tool.\nCollateral\nIn many parts of our business, we regularly require or agree for collateral to be received from or provided to clients and counterparties in connection with contracts that involve credit risk. In our trading businesses, this collateral is typically in the form of cash, as well as highly-rated and/or liquid securities (i.e. government securities and other bonds or equity securities). Credit risks in our non-trading and securities finance businesses are also often secured by bonds and equity securities and by other types of assets. Collateral serves to reduce the risk of loss inherent in an exposure. However, changing market values of the collateral we hold, unexpected increases in the credit exposure to a client or counterparty, reductions in the value or change in the type of securities held by us, as well as operational errors or errors in the manner in which we seek to exercise our rights, may reduce the risk mitigation effects of collateral. While collateral is often an alternative source of repayment, it does not replace the requirement within our policies and guidelines for high-quality underwriting. We also may choose to incur credit exposure without the benefit of collateral or other risk mitigating credits rights.\nOur credit risk guidelines require that the collateral we accept for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality, can be reliably valued and is supported by a valid security interest that permits liquidation if or when required. Generally, when collateral is of lower quality, more difficult to value or more challenging to liquidate, higher discounts to market values are applied for the purposes of measuring credit risk. For certain less liquid collateral, longer liquidation periods are assumed when determining the credit exposure.\nAll types of collateral are assessed regularly by ERM, as is the basis on which the collateral is valued. Our assessment of collateral, including the ability to liquidate collateral in the event of a counterparty default, and also with regard to market values of collateral under a variety of hypothetical market \nconditions, is an integral component of our assessment of risk and approval of credit limits. We also seek to identify, limit and monitor instances of “wrong-way” risk, where a counterparty’s risk of default is positively correlated with the risk of our collateral eroding in value.\nWe maintain policies and procedures requiring that documentation used to collateralize a transaction is legal, valid, binding and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions. We also conduct legal reviews to assess whether our documentation meets these standards on an ongoing basis.\nNetting\nNetting is a mechanism that allows institutions and counterparties to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another through the use of qualifying master netting agreements. A master netting agreement allows for certain rights and remedies upon a counterparty default, including the right to net obligations arising under derivatives or other transactions under such agreement. In such an event, the netting of obligations would result in a single net claim owed by, or to, the counterparty. This is commonly referred to as “close-out netting,” and is pursued wherever possible. We may also enter into master agreements that allow for the netting of amounts payable on a given day and in the same currency, reducing our settlement risk. This is commonly referred to as “payment netting,” and is widely used in our foreign exchange activities.\nAs with collateral, we have policies and procedures in place to apply close-out and payment netting only to the extent that we have verified legal validity and enforceability of the master agreement. In the case of payment netting, operational constraints may preclude us from reducing settlement risk, notwithstanding the legal right to require the same under the master netting agreement. In the event we become unable, due to operational constraints, actions by regulators, changes in accounting principles, law or regulation (or related interpretations) or other factors, to net some or all of our offsetting exposures and payment obligations under those agreements, we would be required to gross up our assets and liabilities on our statement of condition and our calculation of RWA, accordingly. This would result in a potentially material change in our regulatory ratios, including LCR, and present increased credit, liquidity, asset and liability management and operational risks, some of which could be material.\nGuarantees\nA guarantee is a financial instrument that results in credit support being provided by a third party, (i.e., the protection provider) to the underlying obligor (the beneficiary of the provided protection) on account of an exposure owing by the obligor. The protection \n State Street Corporation | 89\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nprovider may support the underlying exposure either in whole or in part. Support of this kind may take different forms. Typical forms of guarantees provided to us include financial guarantees, letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, purchase undertaking agreement contracts and insurance.\nWe have established a review process to evaluate guarantees under the applicable requirements of our policies and Basel III requirements. Governance for this evaluation is covered under policies and procedures that require regular reviews of documentation, jurisdictions and credit quality of protection providers.\nCredit Limits \nCentral to our philosophy for our management of credit risk is the approval and imposition of credit limits, against which we monitor the actual and potential future credit exposure arising from our business activities with counterparties or groups of counterparties. Credit limits are a reflection of our risk appetite, which may be determined by the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the nature of the risk inherent in the business undertaken with the counterparty, or a combination of relevant credit factors. Our risk appetite for certain sectors and certain countries and geographic regions may also influence the level of risk we are willing to assume to certain counterparties.\nThe analysis and approval of credit limits is undertaken similarly across our businesses, although the nature and extent of the analysis may vary, based on the type, term and magnitude of the risk being assumed. Credit limits and underlying exposures are assessed and measured on both a gross and net basis where appropriate, with net exposure determined by deducting the value of any collateral held. For certain types of risk being assumed, we will also assess and measure exposures under a variety of hypothetical market conditions. Credit limit approvals across our business are undertaken by the Credit Risk group, by individuals to whom credit authority has been delegated, or by the Credit Committee.\nCredit limits are re-evaluated annually, or more frequently as needed, and are revised periodically on prevailing and anticipated market conditions, changes in counterparty or country-specific credit ratings and outlook, changes in our risk appetite for certain counterparties, sectors or countries, and enhancements to the measurement of credit utilization.\nReporting \nOngoing active monitoring and management of our credit risk is an integral part of our credit risk management framework. We maintain management information systems to identify, measure, monitor and \nreport credit risk across businesses and legal entities, enabling ERM and our businesses to have timely access to information on credit limits and exposures. Monitoring is performed along the dimensions of counterparty, industry, country and product-specific risks to facilitate the identification of concentrations of risk and emerging trends.\nKey aspects of this credit risk reporting structure include governance and oversight groups and policies that define standards for the reporting of credit risk, data aggregation and sourcing systems.\nThe Credit Risk group routinely assesses the composition of our overall credit risk portfolio for alignment with our stated risk appetite. This assessment includes routine analysis and reporting of the portfolio, monitoring of market-based indicators, the assessment of industry trends and developments and regular reviews of concentrated risks. The Credit Risk group is also responsible, in conjunction with the business units, for defining the appetite for credit risk in the major sectors in which we have a concentration of business activities. These sector-level risk appetite statements, which include counterparty selection criteria and granular underwriting guidelines, are reviewed periodically and approved by either the FRC or Credit Committee.\nMonitoring\nRegular surveillance of credit and counterparty risks is undertaken by our business units, the Credit Risk group and designees with ERM, allowing for oversight. This surveillance process includes, but is not limited to, the following components:\n•\nAnnual Reviews. A formal review of counterparties is conducted at least annually and includes a review of operating performance, primary risk factors and our internal credit risk rating. This annual review also includes a review of current and proposed credit limits, an assessment of our ongoing risk appetite and assessment that supporting legal documentation remains effective.\n•\nInterim Monitoring. Monitoring of our largest and riskiest counterparties is undertaken more frequently, utilizing financial information, market indicators and other relevant credit and performance measures. The nature and extent of this interim monitoring is individually tailored to certain counterparties and/or industry sectors to identify material changes to the risk profile of a counterparty (or group of counterparties) and assign an updated internal risk rating in a timely manner.\nWe maintain an active “surveillance list” for all counterparties. The surveillance list status denotes a \n State Street Corporation | 90\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nconcern with some aspect of a counterparty’s risk profile that warrants closer monitoring of the counterparty’s financial performance and related risk factors. Our ongoing monitoring processes are designed to facilitate the early identification of counterparties whose creditworthiness is deteriorating; any counterparty may be placed on the surveillance list by ERM at its sole discretion.\nCounterparties on the surveillance list generally correspond with the non-investment grade or near non-investment grade ratings established by the major independent credit-rating agencies. The surveillance list also includes any counterparties rated “Special Mention,” “Substandard,” “Doubtful” and “Loss.”\nThe Credit Risk group maintains primary responsibility for our surveillance list processes, and generates a quarterly report of all surveillance list counterparties. The surveillance list is formally reviewed at least on a quarterly basis, with participation from senior Credit Risk staff, and representatives from the business units and our corporate finance and legal groups as appropriate. These meetings include a review of individual surveillance list counterparties, together with credit limits and prevailing exposures, and are focused on actions to contain, reduce or eliminate the risk of loss to us. Identified actions are documented and monitored.\nControls\nGCR provides a separate level of surveillance and oversight over the integrity of our credit risk management processes, including the internal risk-rating system. GCR reviews counterparty credit ratings for all identified sectors on an ongoing basis. GCR is subject to oversight by the FRC, and provides periodic updates to the Board’s RC.\n Specific activities of GCR include the following:\n•\nPerform separate and objective assessments of our credit and counterparty exposures to determine the nature and extent of risk undertaken by the business units;\n•\nExecute periodic credit process and credit product reviews to assess the quality of credit analysis, compliance with policies, guidelines and relevant regulation, transaction structures and underwriting standards, and risk-rating integrity;\n•\nIdentify and monitor developing counterparty, market and/or industry sector trends to limit risk of loss and protect capital;\n•\nDeliver regular and formal reporting to stakeholders, including exam results, \nidentified issues and the status of requisite actions to remedy identified deficiencies;\n•\nAllocate resources for specialized risk assessments (on an as-needed basis); and\n•\nLiaise with assurance partners and regulatory personnel on matters relating to risk rating, reporting and measurement.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe record an allowance for credit losses related to certain on-balance sheet credit exposures, including our financial assets held at amortized cost, as well as certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded commitments and letters of credit. Review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and the estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties. We utilize multiple economic scenarios, consisting of a baseline, upside and downside scenarios, to develop our forecast of expected losses.\nIn 2024, the allowance estimate reflected an increase in loan loss reserves associated with certain commercial real estate and leveraged loans. Allowance estimates are subject to uncertainties, including those inherent in our model and economic assumptions, and management may use qualitative adjustments. If future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024, or if credit risk migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also change.\nAdditional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nOur liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk to our liquidity based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. In managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. This process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.\nWe manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis as well as on a stand-alone basis at our Parent Company and at certain branches and \n State Street Corporation | 91\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nsubsidiaries of State Street Bank. State Street Bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market  and the Federal Reserve’s discount window. The Parent Company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily through SSIF, a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, and the support agreement, as discussed in “Supervision and Regulation” in Business in this Form 10-K, cash and equivalents intended to meet its current debt maturities and other cash needs, as well as those projected over the next twelve-month period. Absent financial distress at the Parent Company, the liquid assets available at SSIF continue to be available to the Parent Company. As of December 31, 2024, the value of our Parent Company’s net liquid assets totaled $438 million, compared with $659 million as of December 31, 2023, excluding available liquidity through SSIF. As of December 31, 2024, our Parent Company and State Street Bank had approximately \n$1.28 billion\n of senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.\nAs a SIFI, our liquidity risk management activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including interpretations of those requirements, under specific U.S. and international regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance, supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these requirements could, in some cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced NII or NIM, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the way in which we deliver our products and services. If we fail to meet regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. Our efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGovernance\nGlobal Treasury is responsible for our management of liquidity. This includes the day-to-day management of our global liquidity position, the development and monitoring of early warning indicators, key liquidity risk metrics, the creation and execution of stress tests, the evaluation and implementation of regulatory requirements, the maintenance and execution of our liquidity guidelines and contingency funding plan (CFP), and routine \nmanagement reporting to ALCO, MRAC and the Board’s RC.\nGlobal Treasury Risk Management, part of ERM, provides separate oversight over the identification, communication and management of Global Treasury’s risks in support of our business strategy. Global Treasury Risk Management reports to the CRO. Global Treasury Risk Management’s responsibilities relative to liquidity risk management include the development and review of policies and guidelines; the monitoring of limits related to adherence to the liquidity risk guidelines and associated reporting.\nLiquidity Framework\nWe manage liquidity according to several principles that are equally important to our overall liquidity risk management framework:\n•\nStructural liquidity management\n addresses liquidity by monitoring and directing the composition of our consolidated statement of condition. Structural liquidity is measured by metrics such as the percentage of total wholesale funds to consolidated total assets, and the percentage of non-government investment securities to client deposits. In addition, on a regular basis and as described below, our structural liquidity is evaluated under various stress scenarios.\n•\nTactical liquidity management\n addresses our day-to-day funding requirements and is largely driven by changes in our primary source of funding, which are client deposits. Fluctuations in client deposits may be supplemented with short-term borrowings, repurchase agreements, FHLB products and certificates of deposit.\n•\nStress testing and contingent funding planning\n are longer-term strategic liquidity risk management practices. Regular and ad hoc liquidity stress testing are performed under various severe but plausible scenarios at the consolidated level and at significant subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. These tests contemplate severe market and events specific to us under various time horizons and severities. Tests contemplate the impact of material changes in key funding sources, credit ratings, additional collateral requirements, contingent uses of funding, systemic shocks to the financial markets and operational failures based on market and assumptions specific to us. The stress tests evaluate the required level of funding versus available sources in an adverse environment. As stress testing contemplates potential forward-looking scenarios, results also serve \n State Street Corporation | 92\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nas a trigger to activate specific liquidity stress levels and contingent funding actions.\nCFPs are designed to assist senior management with decision-making associated with any contingency funding response to a possible or actual crisis scenario. The CFPs define roles, responsibilities and management actions to be taken in the event of deterioration of our liquidity profile caused by either an event specific to us or a broader disruption in the capital markets. Specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions.\nLiquidity Risk Metrics\nIn managing our liquidity, we employ early warning indicators and metrics intended to detect situations which may result in a liquidity stress, including changes in our stock price and spreads on our long-term debt. Additional metrics that are critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and monitored as part of our routine liquidity management include measures of our fungible cash position, purchased wholesale funds, unencumbered liquid assets, deposits and the total of investment securities and loans as a percentage of total client deposits.\nAsset Liquidity\nCentral to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the LCR. As a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. Agencies. The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to improve the banking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows. HQLA primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the LCR rule. Net cash outflows are measured as prescribed under the LCR rule which provides a significant benefit for deposits classified as operational. We report the LCR to the Federal Reserve daily. For both the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, average daily LCR for the Parent Company\n was 107% \nand 106%, respectively. The impact of higher deposits on the Parent Company’s LCR is limited by a cap, known as the transferability restriction, on the HQLA from State Street Bank that can be recognized at the Parent Company as defined in the U.S. LCR Final Rule. This restriction limits the HQLA used in the calculation of the Parent Company’s LCR to the \namount of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary (State Street Bank). The average HQLA, post-prescribed haircuts for the Parent Company under the LCR final rule definition was \n$142.34 billion\n for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 compared to $128.96 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in client deposits relative to the prior period. For the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the LCR for State Street Bank was approximately \n134%\n.\nIn addition, as a large banking organization, we are subject to the NSFR rule approved by the U.S. Agencies. The NSFR rule requires large banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of available stable funding, which is a weighted measure of a company’s funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated by applying standardized weightings to the company’s equity and liabilities based on their expected stability. The amount of stable funding can be no less than the amount of required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics. As a U.S. G-SIB, we are required to maintain an NSFR that is equal to or greater than 100%. As a subsidiary of a U.S. G-SIB, State Street Bank is similarly required to maintain an NSFR that is equal to or greater than 100%. As of December 31, 2024, both the Parent Company’s and State Street Bank’s NSFR were above the 100% minimum NSFR requirement. The average NSFR for the Parent Company was 137% and\n 141% f\nor the three months ended December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively.\nWe maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the Federal Reserve of approximately \n$86.88 billion\n at the Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central banks for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, and $69.28 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The higher levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect higher levels of client deposits.\nLiquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB), the FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street Bank is a member of the FHLB. This membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset and liability management.\nAccess to primary, intraday and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions. \n State Street Corporation | 93\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn addition to the investment securities included in our asset liquidity, we have other unencumbered investment securities and certain loans that we can pledge as collateral to access these various facilities. These additional assets are available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our LCR asset liquidity.\nThe average fair value of total unencumbered securities was \n$63.23 billion\n for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, compared to $76.86 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.\nMeasures of liquidity include LCR and NSFR, which are described in “Supervision and Regulation” in Business in this Form 10-K.\nUses of Liquidity\nSignificant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to clients to settle securities transactions; increases in our investment and loan portfolios; or other permitted purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring use of our liquidity involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our prime services program.\nWe had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling $34.19 billion and $34.20 billion and standby letters of credit totaling $0.91 billion and $1.51 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 75% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and 33% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. Since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.\nInformation about our resolution planning and the impact actions under our resolution plans could have on our liquidity is provided in “Supervision and Regulation” in Business in this Form 10-K.\nFunding\nDeposits\nWe provide products and services including custody, accounting, administration, daily pricing, FX services, cash management, financial asset management, securities finance and investment advisory services. As a provider of these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. As a global custodian, clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of both \nDecember \n31, 2024 and \nDecember 31, 2023, \napproximately 70% of our average total deposit balances were denominated in U.S. dollars, 15% in EUR, 10% in GBP and 5% \nin all other currencies.\nShort-Term Funding\nOur on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. In addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors through relatively low-cost channels to further support business growth. As discussed earlier under “Asset Liquidity,” State Street Bank’s membership in the FHLB allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral. We had\n \n$9.8 billion and $2.5 billion outstanding of FHLB funding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These outstanding borrowings have initial maturities of approximately twelve months and are recorded in other short-term borrowings in the consolidated statement of condition.\nShort-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are short-term in nature, generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities. These balances were \n$3.68 billion\n and $1.87 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nState Street Bank continues to maintain a line of credit with a financial institution of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $0.97 billion, as of December 31, 2024, to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancellable by either party with prior notice. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit.\nLong-Term Funding\nWe have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business needs. In addition, State Street Bank also has current authorization from the Board to issue unsecured senior debt. The total amount remaining for issuance pursuant to this authority is $2.60 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n State Street Corporation | 94\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn March 18, 2024, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.993% fixed rate senior notes due 2027.\nOn August 20, 2024, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.530% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2029.\nOn October 22, 2024, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.330% fixed rate senior notes due 2027, $300 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2027, and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.675% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2032.\nOn November 1, 2024, we redeemed $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.354% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2025.\nOn November 25, 2024, State Street Bank issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2026, $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.594% fixed rate senior notes due 2026 and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.782% fixed rate senior notes due 2029.\nOn January 27, 2025, we redeemed $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.857% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2026.\nOn February 6, 2025, we redeemed $300 million aggregate principal amount of 1.746% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2026.\nAgency Credit Ratings\nOur ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by major credit rating agencies.\nTABLE 29: CREDIT RATINGS\nAs of December 31, 2024\n \nStandard & Poor’s\nMoody’s Investors Service\nFitch\nState Street:\nSenior debt\nA\nAa3\nAA-\nSubordinated debt\nA-\nA2\nA\nJunior subordinated debt\nBBB\nA3\nNR\nPreferred stock\nBBB\nBaa1\nBBB+\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nState Street Bank:\nShort-term deposits\nA-1+\nP-1\nF1+\nLong-term deposits\nAA-\nAa1\nAA+\nSenior debt/Long-term issuer\nAA-\nAa2\nAA\nSubordinated debt\nA\nAa3\nNR\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nFactors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include:\n•\ndiverse and stable core earnings;\n•\nrelative market position;\n•\nstrong risk management;\n•\nstrong capital ratios;\n•\ndiverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client deposits;\n•\nstrong liquidity monitoring procedures; and\n•\npreparedness for current or future regulatory developments.\nHigh ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:\n•\nproviding confidence for unsecured funding and depositors;\n•\nincreasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products;\n•\nfacilitating reduced collateral haircuts in secured lending transactions; and\n•\nengaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.\nA downgrade or reduction in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which could increase the related cost of funds. In turn, this could cause the sudden and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.\nA majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by major rating agencies. The additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.\n State Street Corporation | 95\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nContractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe long-term contractual cash obligations included within Table 30: Long-Term Contractual Cash Obligations were recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as of December 31, 2024, except for the interest portions of long-term debt and finance leases.\nTABLE 30: LONG-TERM CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS\nDecember 31, 2024\nPayments Due by Period\n(In millions)\nLess than 1\nyear\n1-3\nyears\n4-5\nyears\nOver 5\nyears\nTotal\nLong-term debt\n(1)(2)\n$\n1,285\n \n$\n9,595\n \n$\n4,520\n \n$\n7,756\n \n$\n23,156\n \nOperating leases\n182\n \n286\n \n206\n \n342\n \n1,016\n \nFinance lease and equipment financing obligations\n(2)\n55\n \n26\n \n—\n \n—\n \n81\n \nTax liability\n—\n \n22\n \n—\n \n—\n \n22\n \nTotal contractual cash obligations\n$\n1,522\n \n$\n9,929\n \n$\n4,726\n \n$\n8,098\n \n$\n24,275\n \n(1)\n Long-term debt excludes finance lease obligations and equipment financing (presented as a separate line item) and the effect of interest rate swaps.

Operational risk may result from, but is not limited to, errors relating to transaction processing, breaches of internal control systems, or business interruption due to system failures or other events. Operational risk also includes potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a byproduct of our failure to maintain and execute an adequate system of internal control. In the case of an operational risk event, we could suffer financial loss and potential regulatory action, as well as reputational damage.\nUnforeseen external events, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics, global conflicts, or other geopolitical events (including the ongoing wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East), may result in stress on the operating environment and increase operational risk.\nOperational risk encompasses fiduciary risk and legal risk. Fiduciary risk is defined as the risk that we fail to properly exercise our fiduciary duties in our provision of products or services to clients. Legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations.\nOperational risk is inherent in the performance of investment servicing and investment management activities on behalf of our clients. Whether it be fiduciary risk, risk associated with execution and processing or other types of operational risk, a consistent, transparent and effective operational risk framework is key to identifying, monitoring and managing operational risk. To mitigate these risks, we have established policies, procedures, internal control standards and an operational risk framework. Controls are designed to manage operational risk at levels appropriate to our business model, the business environment and the markets in which we operate taking into account factors such as regulation and competition.\nThe organizational framework for operational risk is based on risk management activities comprising:\n•\nGovernance: We have established governance structures to oversee and assess our operational risk management activities and our operational risk policy;\n•\nAccountability: Business managers are responsible for maintaining an effective system of internal controls commensurate \nwith their risk profiles and in accordance with State Street policies and procedures. Operational risk management is the second line function responsible for developing risk management policies and tools for assessing, measuring and monitoring operational risk; and\n•\nOperational Risk Management Framework: An established operational risk management framework supports and drives the identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring of operational risk.\nGovernance\nOur Board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall operational risk policy.\nOur operational risk policy establishes our approach to our management of operational risk across our business. The policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of operational risk, and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the operational risk framework.\nExecutive management manages and oversees our operational risk through membership on risk management committees, including TORC and the Operational Risk and Controls Committee, each of which ultimately reports to a committee of the Board.\nThe Operational Risk and Controls Committee, chaired by the global head of operational risk, oversees the operational risk framework and policies, reviews and monitors program outputs and metrics, and monitors resolution of significant operational risk matters.\nAccountability\nAccountability for managing operational risk spans the first and second lines of defense:\n•\nThe global head of Operational Risk, a member of the CRO’s executive management team, leads ERM’s corporate ORM group. ORM is responsible for developing risk management policies and tools for assessing, measuring, monitoring and managing operational risk. The ORM function includes risk oversight of all lines of business and functions; and\n•\nBusiness Managers are responsible for managing day to day operations, maintaining an effective system of internal controls and managing operational risks within risk appetite in its normal course of business.\nCorporate Audit, as a third line of defense, performs separate reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies utilized across our business.\n State Street Corporation | 97\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperational Risk Management Framework\nThe operational risk management framework has been established in a structured manner to drive the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting of operational risk. Operational risk management framework includes key elements such as risk and control self-assessment, capital analysis, monitoring and reporting and documentation and guidelines. These framework components are described below.\nRisk and Control Self-Assessment\nThe objective of the risk and control self-assessment program is to proactively identify, assess and manage operational risks and related controls associated with day-to-day operations. A key component of understanding how risks are managed is to understand the effectiveness of controls. Effectiveness of controls is concluded through testing, both internal and external, business control assurance activities and self-assessments along with other control function reviews, such as a SOX testing program.\nCapital Analysis\nThe primary measurement tool used to quantify operational risk capital and RWA related to operational risk under the advanced approaches is the loss distribution approach (LDA) model. Such required capital and RWA totaled $3.95 billion and \n$49.35 billion\n, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, compared to $3.50 billion and $43.77 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023; refer to the “Capital” section in “Financial Condition,” of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\nThe LDA model incorporates the three required operational risk elements described below:\n•\nInternal loss event data is collected from across our business in conformity with our operating loss policy that establishes the requirements for collecting and reporting individual loss events;\n•\nExternal loss event data from other financial institutions supplements our internal loss data pool with respect to loss event severity; and\n•\nBusiness environment and internal control factors are those characteristics of a bank’s internal and external operating environment that bear an exposure to operational risk.\nMonitoring and Reporting\nThe objective of risk monitoring is to proactively monitor the changing business environment and corresponding operational risk exposure. It is achieved through monitoring tools that are designed to help us understand changes in the business environment, internal control factors, risk metrics, risk assessments, exposures and operating effectiveness, \nas well as details of loss events and progress on risk initiatives implemented to mitigate potential risk exposures.\nOperational risk reporting is intended to provide transparency, thereby enabling management to manage risk, provide oversight and escalate issues in a timely manner. It is designed to allow the business units, executive management, and the Board’s control functions and committees to gain insight into activities that may result in risks and potential exposures.\nDocumentation and Guidelines\nDocumentation and guidelines allow for consistency and repeatability of the various processes that support the operational risk framework across our business.\nOperational risk guidelines document our practices and describe the key elements in a business unit’s operational risk management program. The purpose of the guidelines is to set forth and define key operational risk terms, provide further detail on our operational risk programs, and detail the business units’ responsibilities to identify, assess, measure, monitor and report operational risk. The guideline supports our operational risk policy.\nData standards have been established with the intent of maintaining consistent data repositories and systems that are controlled, accurate and available on a timely basis to support operational risk management.\nInformation Technology Risk Management\nOverview and Principles\nWe define information technology risk as the risk associated with the use, ownership, operation and adoption of information technology. Information technology risk includes risks potentially triggered by non-compliance with regulatory obligations or expectations, information security or cyber incidents, internal control and process gaps, operational events and adoption of new business technologies.\nThe principal technology risks within our risk policy and risk appetite framework include:\n•\nThird party risk;\n•\nBusiness disruption and technology resiliency risk;\n•\nTechnology change management risk;\n•\nCyber and information security risk;\n•\nTechnology asset and configuration risk; and\n•\nTechnology obsolescence risk.\nGovernance\nOur Board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall technology risk framework and program. It does so through its TOPS, which \n State Street Corporation | 98\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nreviews and approves our risk policy and appetite framework annually as well as our cybersecurity policy and related standards.\nOur risk policy establishes our approach to our management of technology risk across our business. The policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of technology risk and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the risk framework.\nRisk control functions in the business are responsible for adopting and executing the risk framework and reporting requirements. They do this, in part, by developing and maintaining an inventory of critical applications and supporting infrastructure, as well as identifying, assessing and measuring technology risk. They are also responsible for monitoring and evaluating risk on a continual basis using key risk indicators, risk reporting and adopting appropriate risk responses to risk issues.\nEnterprise Technology Risk Management (ETRM) is the separate risk function responsible for the technology risk management oversight and appetite, and technology risk framework development and execution. ETRM also performs overall technology risk monitoring and reporting to the Board, and provides a separate view of the technology risk posture to executive leadership.\nWe manage technology risks by:\n•\nCoordinating various risk assessment and risk management activities, including ERM operational risk programs;\n•\nEstablishing, through TORC and TOPS of the Board, the enterprise level technology risk and cyber risk appetite and limits;\n•\nProducing enterprise level risk reporting, aggregation, dashboards, profiles and risk appetite statements;\n•\nValidating appropriateness of reporting of information technology and cybersecurity risks and risk acceptance to senior management risk committees and the Board;\n•\nPromoting a strong technology and cybersecurity risk culture through communication;\n•\nServing as an escalation and challenge point for risk policy guidance, expectations and clarifications; \n•\nAssessing effectiveness of key enterprise information technology and cybersecurity risk and internal control remediation programs; and\n•\nProviding risk oversight, challenge and monitoring for the Enterprise Continuity Services function and Third Party Management program, including the collection of risk appetite, metrics and key risk indicators, and reviewing issue management processes and consistent program adoption.\nCybersecurity Risk Management\nCybersecurity risk is managed as part of our overall information technology risk as outlined above. For additional information about our cybersecurity risk management program, refer to",
    "item1c": "Item 1C in this Form 10-K.\nThe TORC assesses and manages the effectiveness of our cybersecurity program, which is overseen by the TOPS of our Board. The TOPS receives regular cybersecurity updates throughout the year and is responsible for reviewing and approving the policy on an annual basis.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk is defined by the U.S. Agencies as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. We are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset and liability management, activities. \nInformation about the market risk associated with our trading activities is provided below under “Trading Activities.” Information about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate risk, is provided below under “Asset and Liability Management Activities.”\nTrading Activities\nIn the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity needs, our clients’ requirements and market volatility and our execution against those factors. \nWe engage in trading activities primarily to support our clients’ needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity. In connection with certain of these trading activities, we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risk. These activities are generally intended to generate foreign exchange trading services revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility. In addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets.\nOur clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals \n State Street Corporation | 99\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nand business activities. With the growth of cross-border investing, our clients often enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward and option contracts in support of these client needs, and act as a dealer in the currency markets.\nAs part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts and interest rate futures. As of December 31, 2024, the notional amount of these derivative contracts was $2.70 trillion, of which $2.62 trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. We seek to match positions closely with the objective of mitigating related currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates. \nGovernance\nOur assumption of market risk in our trading activities is an integral part of our corporate risk appetite. The RC of the Board reviews and oversees our management of market risk, including the approval of key market risk policies and the receipt and review of regular market risk reporting, as well as periodic updates on selected market risk topics.\nThe Trading and Markets Risk Committee, a sub-committee of the previously described FRC (refer to “Risk Committees”), oversees all market risk-taking activities across our business associated with trading. The TMRC, which reports to the FRC, is composed of members of ERM, our Global Markets business and our Global Treasury group, other control functions, as well as our senior executives who manage our trading businesses and other members of management who possess specialized knowledge. The TMRC meets regularly to monitor the management of our trading market risk activities.\nOur business units identify, manage and are responsible for the market risks inherent in their businesses. A dedicated market risk management group within ERM, and other groups within ERM, work with those business units to assist them in the identification, assessment, monitoring, management and control of market risk, and assist business unit managers with their market risk management and measurement activities. ERM provides an additional line of oversight, support and coordination designed to promote the consistent identification, measurement and management of market risk across business \nunits, separate from those business units’ discrete activities.\nThe ERM market risk management group is responsible for the management of corporate-wide market risk, the monitoring of key market risks and the development and maintenance of market risk management policies, guidelines and standards aligned with our corporate risk appetite. This group also establishes and approves market risk tolerance limits and trading authorities based on, but not limited to, measures of notional amounts, sensitivity, VaR and stress. Such limits and authorities are specified in our trading and market risk guidelines which govern our management of trading market risk.\nRisk Appetite\nOur corporate market risk appetite is specified in policy statements that outline the governance, responsibilities and requirements surrounding the identification, measurement, analysis, management and communication of market risk arising from our trading activities. These policy statements also set forth the market risk control framework designed to monitor, support, manage and control this portion of our risk appetite. All groups involved in the management and control of market risk associated with trading activities are required to comply with the qualitative and quantitative elements of these policy statements. Our trading market risk control framework is composed of the following:\n•\nA trading market risk management process led by ERM, separate from the business units’ discrete activities;\n•\nDefined responsibilities and authorities for the primary groups involved in trading market risk management;\n•\nA trading market risk measurement methodology that captures correlation effects and allows aggregation of market risk across risk types, markets and business lines;\n•\nDaily monitoring, analysis and reporting of market risk exposures associated with trading activities against market risk limits;\n•\nA defined limit structure and escalation process in the event of a market risk limit excess;\n•\nUse of VaR models to measure the one-day market risk exposure of trading positions;\n•\nUse of VaR as a ten-day-based regulatory capital measure of the market risk exposure of trading positions;\n•\nUse of non-VaR-based limits and other controls;\n•\nUse of stressed-VaR models, stress-testing analysis and scenario analysis to support the \n State Street Corporation | 100\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ntrading market risk measurement and management process by assessing how portfolios and global business lines perform under extreme market conditions;\n•\nUse of back-testing as a diagnostic tool to assess the accuracy of VaR models and other risk management techniques; and\n•\nA new product approval process that requires market risk teams to assess trading-related market risks and apply risk tolerance limits to proposed new products and business activities.\nWe use our CAP to assess our overall capital and liquidity in relation to our risk profile and provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity levels. With respect to market risk associated with trading activities, our risk management and our calculations of regulatory capital are based primarily on our internal VaR models and stress testing analysis. As discussed in detail under “Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR” below, VaR is measured daily by ERM.\nThe TMRC oversees our market risk exposure in relation to limits established within our risk appetite framework. These limits define threshold levels for VaR- and stressed VaR-based measures and are applicable to all trading positions subject to regulatory capital requirements. These limits are designed to mitigate undue concentration of market risk exposure, in light of the primarily non-proprietary nature of our trading activities. The risk appetite framework and associated limits are reviewed and approved by the Board’s RC.\nCovered Positions\nOur trading positions are subject to regulatory market risk capital requirements if they meet the regulatory definition of a “covered position.” A covered position is generally defined by the U.S. Agencies as an on- or off-balance sheet position associated with the organization’s trading activities that is free of any restrictions on its tradability, but does not include intangible assets, certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain equity positions not publicly traded. All FX and commodity positions are considered covered positions, regardless of the accounting treatment they receive. The identification of covered positions for inclusion in our market risk capital framework is governed by our trading and market risk guidelines, which outline the standards we use to determine whether a trading position is a covered position.\nOur covered positions consist primarily of the trading portfolios held by our Global Markets business. They also arise from certain positions held by our Global Treasury group. These trading positions include products such as foreign exchange spot, \nforeign exchange forwards, non-deliverable forwards, foreign exchange options, foreign exchange funding swaps, currency futures, financial futures and interest rate futures. New activities are analyzed to determine if the positions arising from such new activities meet the definition of a covered position and conform to our trading and market risk guidelines. This documented analysis, including any decisions with respect to market risk treatments, must receive approval from the Covered Positions Working Group which reports to the BOC.\nWe use spot rates, forward points, yield curves and discount factors imported from third-party sources to measure the value of our covered positions, and we use such values to mark our covered positions to market on a daily basis. These values are subject to separate validation by us in order to evaluate reasonableness and consistency with market experience. The mark-to-market gain or loss on spot transactions is calculated by applying the spot rate to the foreign currency principal and comparing the resultant base currency amount to the original transaction principal. The mark-to-market gain or loss on a forward foreign exchange contract or forward cash flow contract is determined as the difference between the life-to-date (historical) value of the cash flow and the value of the cash flow at the inception of the transaction. The mark-to-market gain or loss on interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows from each leg of the swap transaction.\nValue-at-Risk and Stressed VaR\nWe use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading-related VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading-related VaR, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements.\nWe utilize an internal VaR model to calculate our regulatory market risk capital requirements. We use a historical simulation model to calculate daily VaR- and stressed VaR-based measures for our covered positions in conformity with regulatory requirements. Our VaR model seeks to capture identified material risk factors associated with our covered positions, including risks arising from market movements such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and option-implied volatilities.\nWe have adopted standards and guidelines to value our covered positions which govern our VaR- and stressed VaR-based measures. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical \n State Street Corporation | 101\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nvolatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period. We also use the same platform to calculate a one-tail, 99% confidence interval, one-business-day VaR for internal risk management purposes. A 99% one-tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses are not expected to exceed the estimated VaR more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year.\nOur market risk models, including our VaR model, are subject to change in connection with the governance, validation and back-testing processes described below. These models can change as a result of changes in our business activities, our historical experiences, market forces and events, regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors. In addition, the models are subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. Changes in our models may result in changes in our measurements of our market risk exposures, including VaR, and related measures, including regulatory capital. These changes could result in material changes in those risk measurements and related measures as calculated and compared from period to period.\nValue-at-Risk Measures\nVaR measures are based on the most recent two years of historical price movements for instruments and related risk factors to which we have exposure. The instruments in question are limited to foreign exchange spot, forward and options contracts and interest rate contracts, including futures and interest rate swaps. Historically, these instruments have exhibited a higher degree of liquidity relative to other available capital markets instruments. As a result, the VaR measures shown reflect our ability to rapidly adjust exposures in highly dynamic markets. For this reason, risk inventory, in the form of net open positions, across all currencies is typically limited. In addition, long and short positions in major, as well as minor, currencies provide risk offsets that limit our potential downside exposure.\nOur VaR methodology uses a historical simulation approach based on market-observed changes in foreign exchange rates, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates and implied volatilities, and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. Our VaR model incorporates approximately 5,000 risk factors and includes correlations among currency, interest rates and other market rates.\nAll VaR measures are subject to limitations and must be interpreted accordingly. Some, but not all, of the limitations of our VaR methodology include the following:\n•\nCompared to a shorter observation period, a two-year observation period is slower to reflect increases in market volatility (although temporary increases in market volatility will affect the calculation of VaR for a longer period); consequently, in periods of sudden increases in volatility or increasing volatility, in each case relative to the prior two-year period, the calculation of VaR may understate current risk;\n•\nCompared to a longer observation period, a two-year observation period may not reflect as many past periods of volatility in the markets, because such past volatility is no longer in the observation period; consequently, historical market scenarios of high volatility, even if similar to current or likely future market circumstances, may fall outside the two-year observation period, resulting in a potential understatement of current risk;\n•\nThe VaR-based measure is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and does not indicate the potential magnitude of losses beyond this confidence level; \n•\nIn certain cases, VaR-based measures approximate the impact of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and portfolios; this may happen because the number of inputs included in the VaR model is necessarily limited; for example, yield curve risk factors do not exist for all future dates;\n•\nThe use of historical market information may not be predictive of future events, particularly those that are extreme in nature; this “backward-looking” limitation can cause VaR to understate or overstate risk;\n•\nThe effect of extreme and rare market movements is difficult to estimate; this may result from non-linear risk sensitivities as well as the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in the VaR calculations; and\n•\nIntra-day risk is not captured.\nWe calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use to calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. The stressed VaR model is designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This stressed VaR meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial \n State Street Corporation | 102\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nstress. For each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from within the available historical data. This historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the Standard & Poor’s downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011. As the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future market stress events will be incorporated.\nStress Testing\nWe have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions. We also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. We conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process. Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).\nStress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by ERM and reported to the TMRC. Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the TMRC if material. In addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt immediate review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.\nWe perform scenario analysis daily based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur. Relevant scenarios are chosen from an inventory of historical financial stresses and applied to our current portfolio. These historical event scenarios involve spot foreign exchange, credit, equity, unforeseen geo-political events and natural disasters, and government and central bank intervention scenarios. Examples of the specific historical scenarios we incorporate in our stress testing program may include the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States and the 2008 financial crisis. We continue to update our inventory of historical stress scenarios as new stress conditions emerge in the financial markets.\nAs each of the historical stress events is associated with a different time horizon, in some instances we normalize results by scaling down the longer horizon events to a ten-day horizon and keeping the shorter horizon events (i.e., events that are shorter than ten days) at their original terms. We also conduct sensitivity analysis daily to calculate the impact of a large predefined shock in a specific risk factor or a group of risk factors on our current portfolio. These predefined shocks include parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts and foreign exchange spot and volatility surface shifts. In a parallel shift scenario, we apply a constant factor shift across all yield curve tenors. In a non-parallel shift scenario, we apply different shock levels to different tenors of a yield curve, rather than shifting the entire curve by a constant amount. Non-parallel shifts include steepening, flattening and butterflies.\nValidation and Back-Testing\nWe perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testing involves the comparison of estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual P&L outcomes observed from daily market movements. We back-test our VaR model using a “clean” P&L, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading.\nOur VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity.\nWe experienced one back-testing exception in 2024 and no back-testing exceptions in 2023. At a 99% conf\nidence interval, the statistical expectation for a VaR model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year).\nOur model validation process also evaluates the integrity of our VaR models through the use of regular outcome analysis. This outcome analysis includes back-testing, which compares the VaR model’s predictions to actual outcomes using out-of-sample information. Consistent with regulatory guidance, the back-testing compared a “clean” P&L, defined above, with the one-day VaR produced by the model. The back-testing was performed for a time period not used for model development. The number of occurrences where “clean” trading-book P&L exceeded the one-day VaR was within our expected VaR tolerance level.\n State Street Corporation | 103\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMarket Risk Reporting\nOur ERM market risk management group is responsible for market risk monitoring and reporting. We use a variety of systems and controlled market feeds from third-party services to compile data for several daily, weekly and monthly management reports.\nThe following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as measured by our VaR methodology. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.\nTABLE 32: TEN-DAY VALUE-AT-RISK ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIES FOR COVERED POSITIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nAs of December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nAverage\nMaximum\nMinimum\nVaR\nAverage\nMaximum\nMinimum\nVaR\nGlobal Markets\n$\n13,909\n \n$\n31,813\n \n$\n6,253\n \n$\n12,890\n \n$\n11,697 \n$\n23,797 \n$\n5,106 \n$\n9,029 \nGlobal Treasury\n2,268\n \n8,332\n \n468\n \n2,451\n \n2,712 \n7,311 \n407 \n1,591 \nDiversification\n(2,056)\n(7,807)\n(276)\n(2,851)\n(2,819)\n(6,829)\n(1,021)\n(1,276)\nTotal VaR\n$\n14,121\n \n$\n32,338\n \n$\n6,445\n \n$\n12,490\n \n$\n11,590 \n$\n24,279 \n$\n4,492 \n$\n9,344 \nTABLE 33: TEN-DAY STRESSED VALUE-AT-RISK ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIES FOR COVERED POSITIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nAs of December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nAverage\nMaximum\nMinimum\nVaR\nAverage\nMaximum\nMinimum\nVaR\nGlobal Markets\n$\n44,313\n \n$\n72,735\n \n$\n16,172\n \n$\n41,379\n \n$\n42,569 \n$\n103,551 \n$\n19,606 \n$\n62,724 \nGlobal Treasury\n8,522\n \n23,717\n \n3,943\n \n7,790\n \n6,710 \n16,762 \n3,252 \n5,578 \nDiversification\n(7,581)\n(22,417)\n(1,257)\n(4,580)\n(8,463)\n(18,555)\n(3,486)\n(7,936)\nTotal Stressed VaR\n$\n45,254\n \n$\n74,035\n \n$\n18,858\n \n$\n44,589\n \n$\n40,816 \n$\n101,758 \n$\n19,372 \n$\n60,366 \nThe average and period-end stressed VaR-based measures were both approximately $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $41 million and $60 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in the average stressed VaR was primarily attributed to higher foreign exchange and interest rate risk positions.\nThe VaR-based measures as presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading activities. While overall levels of volatility have varied over the historical observation periods, smaller residual market risk positions during the quarter have led to a reduction in VaR measures presented.\nWe have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval, and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.\nThe following tables present the VaR and stressed-VaR associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The totals of the VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures for the three attributes in total exceeded the related total VaR and total stressed VaR presented in the foregoing tables as of each period-end, primarily due to the benefits of diversification across risk types. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.\nTABLE 34: TEN-DAY VaR ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIES BY RISK FACTOR\n(1)\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nForeign Exchange Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nVolatility Risk\nForeign Exchange Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nVolatility Risk\nBy component:\nGlobal Markets\n$\n3,474\n \n$\n10,422\n \n$\n180\n \n$\n2,348 \n$\n10,023 \n$\n356 \nGlobal Treasury\n409\n \n2,505\n \n—\n \n496 \n1,446 \n— \nDiversification\n(388)\n(2,920)\n—\n \n(324)\n(831)\n— \nTotal VaR\n$\n3,495\n \n$\n10,007\n \n$\n180\n \n$\n2,520 \n$\n10,638 \n$\n356 \n State Street Corporation | 104\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTABLE 35: TEN-DAY STRESSED VaR ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIES BY RISK FACTOR\n(1)\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nForeign Exchange Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nVolatility Risk\nForeign Exchange Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nVolatility Risk\nBy component:\nGlobal Markets\n$\n7,357\n \n$\n43,800\n \n$\n518\n \n$\n5,402 \n$\n64,418 \n$\n501 \nGlobal Treasury\n6,246\n \n7,202\n \n—\n \n4,978 \n6,347 \n— \nDiversification\n(5,017)\n(8,671)\n—\n \n(2,891)\n(6,209)\n— \nTotal Stressed VaR\n$\n8,586\n \n$\n42,331\n \n$\n518\n \n$\n7,489 \n$\n64,556 \n$\n501 \n(1) \nFor purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates. Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate risk. Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component. \nAsset and Liability Management Activities\nThe primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, as well as the currency composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client deposits.\nWe quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Our baseline view of NII is updated on a regular basis. Table 36, Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our baseline rate forecast as of December 31, 2024 was generally consistent with common market expectations for global central bank actions at that point in time, which implied that rates have reached peak levels and rate cuts will continue in 2025.\nTABLE 36: KEY INTEREST RATES FOR BASELINE FORECASTS\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nFed Funds Target\nECB Target\n(1)\n10-Year Treasury\nFed Funds Target\nECB Target\n(1)\n10-Year Treasury\nSpot rates\n4.50\n \n%\n3.00\n \n%\n4.57\n \n%\n5.50 \n%\n4.00 \n%\n3.88 \n%\n12-month forward rates\n4.00\n \n1.75\n \n4.59\n \n4.25 \n2.75 \n3.87 \n(1)\n European Central Bank deposit facility rate.\nIn Table 37: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous 100 basis point shocks to various tenors on the yield curve relative to our baseline rate forecast, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our financial performance. While investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, for purposes of this analysis our deposit balances and mix are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline forecast which assumes client deposit balance rotation including reductions in non-interest-bearing deposit balances. The results of these scenarios should not be extrapolated for other (e.g., more severe) shocks as the impact of interest rate shocks may not be linear. In lower rate scenarios, the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the result is negative interest rates.\nTABLE 37: NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions)\nU.S. Dollar\nAll Other Currencies\nTotal\nU.S. Dollar\nAll Other Currencies\nTotal\nRate change:\nBenefit (Exposure)\nBenefit (Exposure)\nParallel shifts:\n +100 bps shock\n$\n19\n \n$\n292\n \n$\n311\n \n$\n(26)\n$\n274 \n$\n248 \n –100 bps shock\n(16)\n(254)\n(270)\n4 \n(227)\n(223)\nSteeper yield curve:\n +100 bps shift in long-end rates\n(1)\n28\n \n22\n \n50\n \n28 \n11 \n39 \n -100 bps shift in short-end rates\n(1)\n13\n \n(233)\n(220)\n35 \n(215)\n(180)\nFlatter yield curve:\n +100 bps shift in short-end rates\n(1)\n(9)\n270\n \n261\n \n(53)\n262 \n209 \n -100 bps shift in long-end rates\n(1)\n(29)\n(22)\n(51)\n(30)\n(11)\n(41)\n(1) \nThe short end is 0-3 months.

As of December 31, 2024, our USD balance sheet’s NII sensitivity is relatively neutral given expectations for USD deposit betas and the repricing characteristics of our USD assets. Compared to December 31, 2023, our USD NII turned asset sensitive largely driven by lower investment portfolio duration and lower non-interest bearing deposits. As of December 31, 2024, non-USD NII benefits from higher rate scenarios and is exposed to lower rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on the short-end of the yield curve. Compared to December 31, 2023, our non-USD NII sensitivity increased, driven by higher deposit balances and lower duration in the investment portfolio.\nEVE sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a long-term horizon. In the following table, we report our EVE sensitivity to 200 bps instantaneous rate shocks, relative to spot interest rates. EVE sensitivity is dependent on the timing of interest and principal cash flows. Also, the measure only evaluates the spot balance sheet and does not include the impact of new business assumptions.\nTABLE 38: ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY SENSITIVITY\nAs of December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nRate change:\nBenefit (Exposure)\n+200 bps shock\n$\n(1,024)\n$\n(1,447)\n–200 bps shock\n1,205\n \n1,683 \nAs of December 31, 2024, EVE sensitivity remains exposed to upward shifts in interest rates. Compared to December 31, 2023, our sensitivity in the up 200bp shock scenario decreased, primarily driven by a decrease in the duration of the investment portfolio.\nBoth NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity are routinely monitored as market conditions change. For additional information about our Asset and Liability Management Activities, refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Risk Management.”\nModel Risk Management\nState Street uses models to support its financial decision-making and business activities. Model risk is the potential for adverse outcomes due to incorrectly implemented or misused model outputs. Model Risk Management (MRM) is a separate control function within Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) responsible for specifying and maintaining the firmwide MRM policy and framework designed to monitor and control model risk within our risk appetite.\nThe MRM framework includes:\n•\nModel risk governance that defines roles and responsibilities, including the authority to restrict model usage, provides policies and guidance, monitors compliance, and reports regularly to relevant internal committees and the Board of Directors on the overall degree of model risk across the firm;\n•\nModel development standards that focus on conceptual soundness and computational accuracy, data quality, robustness, stability, and sensitivity to assumptions; and\n•\nModel validation standards designed to verify that models are conceptually sound, are computationally accurate, are performing as expected, and are in line with their intended use, and evaluate the level of model risk for each model by considering the model’s materiality, usage, performance, and sufficiency of compensating controls among other factors \nThe MRM function is further responsible for model identification.\nGovernance\nModels used in the regulatory capital calculation can only be deployed for use after undergoing a model validation by ERM’s MRM group. The model validation results and/or a decision by the MRC must permit model usage or the model may not be used.\nERM’s MRM group is responsible for defining the corporate-wide model risk management framework and maintaining policies that are designed to achieve the framework’s objectives. All regulatory capital calculation models, including any artificial intelligence and machine learning models, must comply with the model risk management framework and corresponding policies. The group is responsible for overall model risk governance capabilities, with particular emphasis in the areas of model identification, model validation, model risk reporting, model performance monitoring, tracking of new model development status and committee-level review and challenge.\n State Street Corporation | 106\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe MRC, which is composed of senior managers representing MRM along with functional areas and business units, reports to MRAC, and provides guidance and oversight to the MRM function.\nModel Development and Ongoing Monitoring\nModels are developed under guidelines governing data sourcing, methodology selection and model integrity testing. Model development includes a statement of purpose to align development with intended use. It may also include a comparison of alternative approaches to promote a sound modeling approach.\nModel developers conduct an assessment of data quality and relevance. The development teams conduct a variety of tests of the accuracy, robustness and stability of each model.\nModel owners submit models to the MVG for validation on a regular basis, as per the existing policy. The model owners also conduct ongoing monitoring of each model.\nModel Validation\nMVG is part of MRM within ERM and performs model validations and reviews. MVG is independent, as contemplated by applicable bank regulatory requirements, of both the developers and users of the models. MVG validates models through an evaluation process that assesses the appropriateness, accuracy, and suitability of data inputs, methodologies, documentation, assumptions, and processing code. Model validation also encompasses an assessment of model performance, sensitivity, and robustness, as well as a model’s potential limitations given its particular assumptions or deficiencies. Based on the results of its review, MVG issues a model use decision and may require remedial actions and/or compensating controls on model use. MVG also maintains a model risk rating system, which assigns a risk rating to each model based on an assessment of a model’s inherent and residual risks. These ratings aid in the understanding and reporting of model risk across the model portfolio, and enable the triaging of needs for remediation.\nAlthough model validation is the primary method of subjecting models to independent review and challenge, in practice, a multi-step governance process provides the opportunity for challenge by multiple parties. First, MVG conducts a model validation and issues a model use decision. MVG communicates their result as one of the following three outcomes: “Approved,” “Approved with conditions,” or “Not Approved”. There are three ways in which a model can be deemed “Not approved for Use” given a validation: 1) the aggregation of the model scoring within MRM’s model risk rating system is poor enough to result in a “high” rating, 2) the \nscoring of one or more model risk rating system element(s) is deemed “critical” resulting in an automatic “high” rating irrespective of the other elements as the “critical” element(s) undermines the model, or 3) the remediation action is not properly taken by the due date resulting in a severe compliance breach that undercuts the model rating. Second, these decisions may be reviewed, challenged, and confirmed by the MRC. Finally, model use decisions, risk ratings, and overall levels of model risk may be escalated to and reviewed by MRAC. MRM also reports regularly on model risk issues to the Board.\nStrategic Risk Management\nWe define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. Strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes. Management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business.\nSeparating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. For instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss. An additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue, would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk.\nStrategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. Techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans, which are subject to review and challenge from senior management and the Board of Directors, as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals. The potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk. Management and control of strategic \n State Street Corporation | 107\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nrisks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with oversight from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes.\nCAPITAL\nManaging our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. We assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.\nFramework\nOur objective with respect to management of our capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients’ cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. We strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long-term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and complying with regulatory capital requirements.\nOur capital management focuses on our risk exposures, the regulatory requirements applicable to us with respect to multiple capital measures, the evaluations and resulting credit ratings of the major independent rating agencies, our return on capital at both the consolidated and line-of-business level and our capital position relative to our peers.\nAssessment of our overall capital adequacy includes the comparison of capital sources with capital uses, as well as the consideration of the quality and quantity of the various components of capital. The assessment seeks to determine the optimal level of capital and composition of capital instruments to satisfy all constituents of capital, with the lowest overall cost to shareholders. Other factors considered in our assessment of capital adequacy are strategic and contingency planning, stress testing and planned capital actions.\nCapital Adequacy Process (CAP)\nOur primary federal banking regulator is the Federal Reserve. Both we and State Street Bank are subject to the minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. State Street Bank must exceed the regulatory capital thresholds for “well capitalized” in order for our Parent Company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Accordingly, one of \nour primary objectives with respect to capital management is to exceed all applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements and for State Street Bank to be “well capitalized” under the PCA guidelines established by the FDIC. Our capital management activities are conducted as part of our corporate-wide CAP and associated Capital Policy and Guidelines.\nWe consider capital adequacy to be a key element of our financial well-being, which affects our ability to attract and maintain client relationships; operate effectively in the global capital markets; and satisfy regulatory, security holders and shareholder needs. Capital is one of several elements that affect our credit ratings and the ratings of our principal subsidiaries.\nIn conformity with our Capital Policy and Guidelines, we strive to achieve and maintain specific internal capital levels, not just at a point in time, but over time and during periods of stress, to account for changes in our strategic direction, evolving economic conditions, and financial and market volatility. We have developed and implemented a corporate-wide CAP to assess our overall capital in relation to our risk profile and to provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital levels. The CAP considers material risks under multiple scenarios, with an emphasis on stress scenarios, and encompasses existing processes and systems used to measure our capital adequacy. \nCapital Contingency Planning\nContingency planning is an integral component of capital management. The objective of contingency planning is to monitor current and forecast levels of select capital, liquidity and other measures that serve as early indicators of a potentially adverse capital or liquidity adequacy situation. These measures are one of the inputs used to set our internal capital adequacy level. We review these measures annually for appropriateness and relevance in relation to our financial budget and capital plan. In addition, we maintain an inventory of capital contingency actions designed to conserve or generate capital to support the unique risks in our business model, our client and investor demands and regulatory requirements.\nStress Testing\nWe administer a robust business-wide stress-testing program that executes stress tests each year to assess the institution’s capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions. Our stress testing program is structured around what we determine to be the key risks inherent in our business, as assessed through a recurring material risk identification process. The material risk identification process represents a bottom-up approach to identifying the institution’s most \n State Street Corporation | 108\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nsignificant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, fiduciary, business, reputation and regulatory risks. These key risks serve as an organizing principle for much of our risk management framework, as well as reporting, including the “risk dashboard” provided to the Board.\nIn connection with the focus on our key risks, each stress test incorporates idiosyncratic loss events tailored to our unique risk profile and business activities. Due to the nature of our business model and our consolidated statement of condition, our risks differ from those of a traditional commercial bank. Over the past few years, stress scenarios have included a deep recession in the United States, including impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, a break-up of the Eurozone, a severe recession in China and an oil shock precipitated by turmoil in the Middle East/North Africa region.\nThe Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, which includes us, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. The Federal Reserve uses its annual CCAR process, which incorporates hypothetical financial and economic stress scenarios, to review those capital plans and assess whether banking organizations have capital planning processes that account for idiosyncratic risks and provide for sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. As part of its CCAR process, the Federal Reserve assesses each organization’s capital adequacy, capital planning process and plans to distribute capital, such as dividend payments or stock purchase programs. Management and Board risk committees review, challenge and approve CCAR results and assumptions before submission to the Federal Reserve.\nThrough the evaluation of our capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions, the stress testing process provides us important insights for capital planning, risk management and strategic decision-making. \nGovernance\nIn order to support integrated decision-making, we have identified three management elements to aid in the compatibility and coordination of our CAP:\n•\nRisk Management - identification, measurement, monitoring and forecasting of different types of risk and their combined impact on capital adequacy;\n•\nCapital management - determination of optimal capital levels; and\n•\nBusiness Management - strategic planning, budgeting, forecasting and performance management.\nWe have a hierarchical structure supporting appropriate committee review of relevant risk and capital information. The ongoing responsibility for capital management rests with our Treasurer. The Capital Management group within Global Treasury is responsible for the Capital Policy and Guidelines, development of the Capital Plan, the oversight of global capital management and optimization.\nThe MRAC provides oversight of our capital management, our capital adequacy, our internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. In addition, MRAC approves our balance sheet strategy and related activities. The Board’s RC assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities related to the assessment and management of risk and capital. Our Capital Policy is reviewed and approved annually by the Board’s RC.\nGlobal Systemically Important Bank\nWe have been identified by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as a G-SIB. Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III rule.\nWe and our depositary institution subsidiaries are subject to the current Basel III minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio guidelines.\nAdditional information about G-SIBs is provided under “Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards” in “Supervision and Regulation” in Business in this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory Capital\nWe and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. We are also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by the U.S. Agencies.\nThe Basel III rule provides two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy: the “standardized approach” and the “advanced approaches”, applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. The standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk RWA, including specified risk weights for on and certain off-balance sheet exposures. The advanced approaches consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach used for the calculation of credit risk RWA, and the Advanced Measurement Approach used for the calculation of operational risk RWA.\n State Street Corporation | 109\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in 2010, we and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a “capital floor,” also referred to as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy, such that our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced approaches and the standardized approach. Under the advanced approaches, State Street and State Street Bank are subject to a 2.5% CCB requirement, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer requirement, which is currently set at 0%. Under the standardized approach, State Street Bank is subject to the same CCB and countercyclical capital buffer requirements, but for State Street, the 2.5% CCB requirement is replaced by the SCB requirement according to the SCB rule issued in 2020. In addition, State Street is subject to a G-SIB surcharge.\nThe SCB replaced, under the standardized approach, the CCB with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institution’s starting and lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement can be no less than 2.5% of RWA. Breaching the SCB or other regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. \nOur SCB requirement was 2.5% for the period from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. On June 26, 2024, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2024 supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated under the 2024 supervisory stress test was below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which remains in effect for the period from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. \nOur minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2024 include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, and a countercyclical buffer of 0.0%. This results in minimum risk-based ratios of 8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, 9.5% for the tier 1 capital ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.\nOur current G-SIB surcharge, through December 31, 2025, is 1.0%. Based upon preliminary calculations using data as of December 31, 2024, we currently anticipate that our surcharge will remain at 1.0% through December 31, 2026; however, that calculation has not yet been finalized and is subject to many financial, balance sheet, market and other factors, and consequently there is a risk that a higher G-SIB surcharge (e.g., 1.5%) may result from the final calculation.\nTo maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial holding company, we and our IDI subsidiaries are required, among other requirements, to be “well capitalized” as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H.\nThe market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positions defined by the rule as “covered positions,” as well as stressed-VaR measures to supplement the VaR measures. The rule also requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our related VaR and stressed-VaR measures. The qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is provided under “Market Risk Management” included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\nThe following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated. We are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards.\n State Street Corporation | 110\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTABLE 39: REGULATORY CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND RELATED REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS\nState Street Corporation\nState Street Bank\n(Dollars in millions)\nBasel III Advanced Approaches December 31, 2024\nBasel III Standardized Approach December 31, 2024\nBasel III Advanced Approaches December 31, 2023\nBasel III Standardized Approach December 31, 2023\nBasel III Advanced Approaches December 31, 2024\nBasel III Standardized Approach December 31, 2024\nBasel III Advanced Approaches December 31, 2023\nBasel III Standardized Approach December 31, 2023\n Common shareholders’ equity:\nCommon stock and related surplus\n$\n11,226\n \n$\n11,226\n \n$\n11,245 \n$\n11,245 \n$\n13,333\n \n$\n13,333\n \n$\n13,033 \n$\n13,033 \nRetained earnings\n29,582\n \n29,582\n \n27,957 \n27,957 \n15,977\n \n15,977\n \n14,454 \n14,454 \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n(2,100)\n(2,100)\n(2,354)\n(2,354)\n(1,805)\n(1,805)\n(2,097)\n(2,097)\nTreasury stock, at cost\n(16,198)\n(16,198)\n(15,025)\n(15,025)\n—\n \n—\n \n— \n— \nTotal\n22,510\n \n22,510\n \n21,823 \n21,823 \n27,505\n \n27,505\n \n25,390 \n25,390 \nRegulatory capital adjustments:\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities \n(8,320)\n(8,320)\n(8,470)\n(8,470)\n(8,054)\n(8,054)\n(8,208)\n(8,208)\nOther adjustments\n(1)\n(391)\n(391)\n(382)\n(382)\n(278)\n(278)\n(298)\n(298)\n Common equity tier 1 capital\n13,799\n \n13,799\n \n12,971 \n12,971 \n19,173\n \n19,173\n \n16,884 \n16,884 \nPreferred stock\n2,816\n \n2,816\n \n1,976 \n1,976 \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n— \n Tier 1 capital\n16,615\n \n16,615\n \n14,947 \n14,947 \n19,173\n \n19,173\n \n16,884 \n16,884 \nQualifying subordinated long-term debt\n1,861\n \n1,861\n \n1,870 \n1,870 \n530\n \n530\n \n536 \n536 \nAdjusted allowance for credit losses\n—\n \n183\n \n— \n150 \n—\n \n183\n \n— \n150 \n Total capital\n$\n18,476\n \n$\n18,659\n \n$\n16,817 \n$\n16,967 \n$\n19,703\n \n$\n19,886\n \n$\n17,420 \n$\n17,570 \n Risk-weighted assets:\nCredit risk\n(2)\n$\n63,252\n \n$\n124,281\n \n$\n61,210 \n$\n109,228 \n$\n57,883\n \n$\n121,785\n \n$\n54,942 \n$\n107,067 \nOperational risk\n(3)\n49,350\n \n NA\n43,768 \nNA\n47,538\n \nNA\n42,297 \nNA\nMarket risk\n2,000\n \n2,000\n \n2,475 \n2,475 \n2,000\n \n2,000\n \n2,475 \n2,475 \nTotal risk-weighted assets\n$\n114,602\n \n$\n126,281\n \n$\n107,453 \n$\n111,703 \n$\n107,421\n \n$\n123,785\n \n$\n99,714 \n$\n109,542 \nCapital Ratios:\n2024 Minimum Requirements Including Capital Conservation Buffer and G-SIB Surcharge\n(4)\n2023 Minimum Requirements Including Capital Conservation Buffer and G-SIB Surcharge\n(4)\nCommon equity tier 1 capital\n8.0\n \n%\n8.0 \n%\n12.0\n \n%\n10.9\n \n%\n12.1 \n%\n11.6 \n%\n17.8\n \n%\n15.5\n \n%\n16.9 \n%\n15.4 \n%\nTier 1 capital\n9.5\n \n9.5 \n14.5\n \n13.2\n \n13.9 \n13.4 \n17.8\n \n15.5\n \n16.9 \n15.4 \nTotal capital\n11.5\n \n11.5 \n16.1\n \n14.8\n \n15.7 \n15.2 \n18.3\n \n16.1\n \n17.5 \n16.0 \n(1)\n Other adjustments within CET1 capital primarily include disallowed deferred tax assets, cash flow hedges that are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, and the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities. \n(2) \nUnder the advanced approaches, credit risk RWA includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of OTC derivative contracts.

The increase in operational risk RWA was primarily due to a model recalibration driven largely by an increase in the value of loss due to inflation and to reflect more recent loss history. Credit risk RWA increased $2.04 billion compared to December 31, 2023, mainly due to increase in over-the-counter derivatives driven by market volatility. \nAs of December 31, 2024, total standardized approach RWA increased $14.58 billion compared to December 31, 2023, mainly driven by an increase in credit risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA mainly reflects higher derivatives RWA, driven by market volatility, higher repo-style transaction RWA, driven by volume, and higher loans RWA, driven by private equity capital call finance loans and CLO loans. \nThe regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2024, presented in Table 39: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculated under the advanced approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the Basel III final rule. The advanced approaches based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of December 31, 2024, based on our internal and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual report on Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended. \nOur advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, \ndepending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.\nDue to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III final rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making. \n State Street Corporation | 113\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios\nWe are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and SLR. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted quarterly average on-balance sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the SLR primarily in that the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly average of on-balance sheet assets, while the SLR additionally includes off-balance sheet exposures. We must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.\nWe are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we must maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we do not maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall. \nTABLE 42: TIER 1 AND SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIOS\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nState Street:\nTier 1 capital\n$\n16,615\n \n$\n14,947 \nAverage assets\n327,181\n \n278,659 \nLess: adjustments for deductions from tier 1 capital and other\n(8,711)\n(8,852)\nAdjusted average assets for Tier 1 leverage ratio\n318,470\n \n269,807 \nAdditional SLR exposure\n38,659\n \n39,291 \nAdjustments for deductions of qualifying central bank deposits\n(87,496)\n(69,579)\nTotal assets for SLR\n$\n269,633\n \n$\n239,519 \nTier 1 leverage ratio\n(1)\n5.2\n \n%\n5.5 \n%\nSupplementary leverage ratio\n6.2\n \n6.2 \nState Street Bank\n(2)\n:\nTier 1 capital\n$\n19,173\n \n$\n16,884 \nAverage assets\n323,086\n \n275,324 \nLess: adjustments for deductions from tier 1 capital and other\n(8,332)\n(8,506)\nAdjusted average assets for Tier 1 leverage ratio\n314,754\n \n266,818 \nAdditional SLR exposure\n40,299\n \n39,069 \nAdjustments for deductions of qualifying central bank deposits\n(87,496)\n(69,579)\nTotal assets for SLR\n$\n267,557\n \n$\n236,308 \nTier 1 leverage ratio \n(1)\n6.1\n \n%\n6.3 \n%\nSupplementary leverage ratio\n7.2\n \n7.1 \n(1) \nTier 1 leverage ratios were calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule.\n(2) \nThe SLR rule requires that, as of January 1, 2018, (i) State Street Bank maintains an SLR of at least 6.0% to be well capitalized under the U.S. banking regulators’ Prompt Corrective Action Framework and (ii) we maintain an SLR of at least 5.0% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.

The 2023 Basel III Endgame Proposal would, among other things, eliminate the advanced approaches for monitoring risk-based capital adequacy in favor of a new standardized expanded risk-based approach that includes new standardized approaches for operational risk and CVA risk RWA components, and would also replace the existing market risk rule with the new FRTB framework. The G-SIB Surcharge Proposal would, among other things, measure the G-SIB surcharge in more granular 0.1% increments as opposed to the 0.5% increments that currently apply.\nFor additional information about regulatory developments, refer to the “Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards” section of “Supervision and Regulation” in Business in this Form 10-K.\nCapital Actions\nPreferred Stock\nThe following table summarizes selected terms of each of the series of the preferred stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2024:\nTABLE 44: PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING\nPreferred Stock\n(1)\n:\nIssuance Date\nDepositary Shares Issued\nAmount outstanding (in millions)\nOwnership Interest Per Depositary Share\nLiquidation Preference Per Share\nLiquidation Preference Per Depositary Share\nPer Annum Dividend Rate\nDividend Payment Frequency\nCarrying Value as of December 31, 2024 \n(In millions)\nRedemption Date\n(2)\nSeries G\nApril 2016\n20,000,000 \n$\n500 \n1/4,000th\n100,000 \n25 \n5.35%\n(3)\nQuarterly: March, June, September and December\n$\n493 \nMarch 15, 2026\nSeries I\nJanuary 2024\n1,500,000 \n1,500 \n1/100th\n100,000 \n1,000 \n6.700% through March 14, 2029; resets March 15, 2029 and every subsequent five year anniversary at  five- year U.S. Treasury rate plus 2.613%\nQuarterly: March, June, September and December\n1,481 \nMarch 15, 2029\nSeries J\nJuly 2024\n850,000 \n850\n1/100th\n100,000 \n1,000 \n6.700% through September 14, 2029; resets September 15, 2029 and every subsequent five  year anniversary at the five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus 2.628%\nQuarterly: March, June, September and December\n842 \nSeptember 15, 2029\n(1) \nThe preferred stock and corresponding depositary shares may be redeemed at our option in whole, but not in part, prior to the redemption date upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event, as defined in the certificate of designation, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share and liquidation price per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.\n(2) \nOn the redemption date, or any dividend payment date thereafter, the preferred stock and corresponding depositary shares may be redeemed by us, in whole or in part, at the liquidation price per share and liquidation price per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.\n(3)\n \nThe dividend rate for the floating rate period of the Series G preferred stock that begins on March 15, 2026 and all subsequent floating rate periods will remain at the current fixed rate in accordance with the LIBOR Act and the contractual terms of the Series G preferred stock. \nOn January 31, 2024, we issued 1.5 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of fixed rate reset, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series I, without par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share), in a public offering.

In addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to “Related Stockholder Matters” included under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, and to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times.\nStock purchases under our common share repurchase program may be made using various types of transactions, including open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction may not be ratable over the duration of the program, may vary from reporting period to reporting period and will depend on several factors, including our capital position and our financial performance, investment opportunities, market conditions, the nature and timing of implementation of revisions to the Basel III framework and the amount of common stock issued as part of employee compensation programs. The common share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nOn behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $310.81 billion and $279.92 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities \ntotaling $325.61 billion and $293.86 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral of $325.61 billion and $293.86 billion, referenced above, $63.66 billion and $59.03 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We or our agents held $68.51 billion and $63.11 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAdditional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in Notes 10, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. \nCertain of our accounting policies, by their nature, include significant accounting estimates and assumptions which require management to make judgments about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements. \nBased on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the significant accounting estimates identified by management are:\n•\nRecurring fair value measurements;\n•\nAllowance for credit losses;\n•\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and\n•\nContingencies. \nThese estimates require the most subjective or complex judgments, and could be most subject to \n State Street Corporation | 117\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nrevision as new information becomes available. An understanding of these estimates is essential to the understanding of our reported results of operations and financial condition. \nThe following is a discussion of the above-mentioned significant accounting estimates. Additional information on our significant accounting policies, including references to applicable footnotes, is provided in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. \nFair Value Measurements \nWe carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets and liabilities, AFS debt securities, certain equity securities and various types of derivative financial instruments. \nChanges in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity in our consolidated statement of condition. In addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition, and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below. \nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or the most advantageous market in which we would transact; we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets and liabilities. When identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market-observable data for similar assets and liabilities. In some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets; as a result, we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value. \nWe categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on U.S. GAAP’s prescribed three-level valuation \nhierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). \nWith respect to derivative instruments, we evaluate the fair value impact of the credit risk of our counterparties. We consider such factors as the market-based probability of default by our counterparties, and our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities, in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value. \nAdditional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. \nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe record an allowance for credit losses related to certain on-balance sheet credit exposures, including our financial assets held at amortized cost, as well as certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded commitments and letters of credit. \nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. We estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset while factoring in prepayment activity where supported by data over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period. We utilize baseline, upside and downside scenarios that are applied based on a probability weighting, in order to better reflect management’s expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment. The multiple scenarios are based on a 13-quarter horizon (or less depending on contractual maturity) with reversion period set to be 27 quarters, calculated by subtracting the 13-quarter period from an average 10-year/40-quarter business cycle. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications, but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable.\n Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs, including macroeconomic forecast assumptions and credit rating migrations during the period. Our macroeconomic forecasts used in determining the December 31, 2024 allowance for credit losses consisted of three scenarios reflecting different assumptions in GDP and unemployment, with the baseline scenario generally in line with market consensus of economic forecasts for GDP and unemployment. We placed the most weight on \n State Street Corporation | 118\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nour baseline scenario, with the remaining weighting split between the upside and downside scenarios. \nKeeping all other factors constant, we estimate that if we had applied 100% weighting to the downside scenario, the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 would have been approximately $78 million higher. This estimate is intended to reflect the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in our scenario weights and is not intended to be indicative of future changes in the allowance for credit losses. \nAdditional information about our allowance for credit losses is provided in Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired at the acquisition date. Other intangible assets represent purchased long-lived intangible assets, primarily client relationships, core deposit intangible assets and technology that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Other intangible assets are initially measured  at their acquisition date fair value, the determination of which requires management judgment. Goodwill is not amortized, while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nManagement reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances arise or events occur that indicate an impairment of the carrying amount may exist. We begin our review by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Events that may indicate impairment include: significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more-likely-than-not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. If we conclude from the qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. However, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete a quantitative assessment in any given year.\nIn 2024, we assessed goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment. Based on our evaluation of the qualitative factors noted above, we determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount. We determined there was no goodwill impairment in 2024.\nOther intangible assets are supported by the future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the intangible asset, less any costs associated with the intangible asset’s eventual disposition. We evaluate other intangible assets for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other groups of assets using the following process. First, we routinely assess whether impairment indicators are present. When impairment indicators are identified as being present, we compare the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the future net undiscounted cash flows are greater than the carrying value, then there is no impairment, but if the intangible asset’s net undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value, we are required to calculate impairment. An impairment is recognized by writing the intangible asset down to its fair value. We evaluate intangible assets for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis. There were no impairments taken on other intangible assets in 2024.\nAdditional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, including information by line of business, is provided in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. \nContingencies\nInformation on significant estimates and judgments related with establishing litigation reserves is discussed in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nInformation with respect to recent accounting developments is provided in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. \n State Street Corporation | 119\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nITEM 7A.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n—\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n State Street Corporation | 121\nCritical Audit \nMatter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.\nServicing Fee Revenue\nDescription of the Matter\nRevenue recognized by the Corporation as servicing fees was $5.016 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. As disclosed in Notes 24 and 25 of the financial statements, servicing fee revenue involves revenue earned from various back and middle office solutions including custody, accounting and fund administration, record keeping, client reporting and investment book of record. The Corporation’s servicing fee revenue involves a significant volume of contracts and transactions and is sourced from multiple systems and processes across different business teams and geographies.\nAuditing servicing fee revenue was complex and involved significant audit effort due to the nature of the Corporation’s contracts, the volume of contracts, and the number of different processes used to recognize revenue.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe identified and obtained an understanding of the processes used by the Corporation to recognize revenue transactions. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Corporation’s processes for recognizing servicing fee revenue, including, among others, controls over the review of client contracts, the calculation and analysis of the key drivers of revenue (e.g., assets under custody), and the flow of this information from the business teams to the department accruing revenue.\nAmong other procedures, to test servicing fee revenue, we selected and analyzed a sample of client contracts to determine whether terms that may have an impact on revenue recognition, including performance obligations and specified fees, were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the contracts. In addition, we reperformed the calculation of revenue for a sample of revenue transactions. We also agreed the amounts recognized to source documents and tested the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue. We obtained third party confirmation of the client balance due for a sample of servicing fees receivable.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1972.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 13, 2025\n State Street Corporation | 122\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME\nYears Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFee revenue:\nServicing fees\n$\n5,016\n \n$\n4,922\n \n$\n5,087\n \nManagement fees\n2,124\n \n1,876\n \n1,939\n \nForeign exchange trading services \n1,401\n \n1,265\n \n1,376\n \nSecurities finance\n438\n \n426\n \n416\n \nSoftware and processing fees\n888\n \n811\n \n789\n \nOther fee revenue\n289\n \n180\n \n(\n1\n)\nTotal fee revenue\n10,156\n \n9,480\n \n9,606\n \nNet interest income:\nInterest income\n11,977\n \n9,180\n \n4,088\n \nInterest expense\n9,054\n \n6,421\n \n1,544\n \nNet interest income\n2,923\n \n2,759\n \n2,544\n \nOther income:\nGains (losses) from sales of available-for-sale securities, net\n(\n79\n)\n(\n294\n)\n(\n2\n)\nTotal other income\n(\n79\n)\n(\n294\n)\n(\n2\n)\nTotal revenue\n13,000\n \n11,945\n \n12,148\n \nProvision for credit losses\n75\n \n46\n \n20\n \nExpenses:\nCompensation and employee benefits\n4,697\n \n4,744\n \n4,428\n \nInformation systems and communications\n1,829\n \n1,703\n \n1,630\n \nTransaction processing services\n998\n \n957\n \n971\n \nOccupancy\n437\n \n426\n \n394\n \nAcquisition and restructuring costs\n—\n \n(\n15\n)\n65\n \nAmortization of other intangible assets\n230\n \n239\n \n238\n \nOther\n1,339\n \n1,529\n \n1,075\n \nTotal expenses\n9,530\n \n9,583\n \n8,801\n \nIncome before income tax expense \n3,395\n \n2,316\n \n3,327\n \nIncome tax expense \n708\n \n372\n \n553\n \nNet income\n$\n2,687\n \n$\n1,944\n \n$\n2,774\n \nNet income available to common shareholders\n$\n2,483\n \n$\n1,821\n \n$\n2,660\n \nEarnings per common share: \nBasic\n$\n8.33\n \n$\n5.65\n \n$\n7.28\n \nDiluted\n8.21\n \n5.58\n \n7.19\n \nAverage common shares outstanding (in thousands):\nBasic\n297,883\n \n322,337\n \n365,214\n \nDiluted\n302,226\n \n326,568\n \n370,109\n \nCash dividends declared per common share\n$\n2.90\n \n$\n2.64\n \n$\n2.40\n \nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. \n State Street Corporation | 123\n STATE STREET CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nYears Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n2,687\n \n$\n1,944\n \n$\n2,774\n \nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of related taxes:\nForeign currency translation, net of related taxes of $\n153\n, ($\n19\n) and $\n47\n,  respectively\n(\n228\n)\n261\n \n(\n441\n)\nNet unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities, net of reclassification adjustment and net of related taxes of $\n164\n, $\n335\n and ($\n650\n), respectively\n467\n \n870\n \n(\n1,767\n)\nNet unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, net of related taxes of $\n0\n, $\n85\n and ($\n133\n),  respectively\n(\n1\n)\n228\n \n(\n357\n)\nNet unrealized gains (losses) on retirement plans, net of related taxes of $\n6\n, $\n0\n and ($\n1\n), respectively\n16\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n13\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n254\n \n1,357\n \n(\n2,578\n)\nTotal comprehensive income\n$\n2,941\n \n$\n3,301\n \n$\n196\n \n \nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. \n State Street Corporation | 124\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CONDITION\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAssets:\nCash and due from banks\n$\n3,145\n \n$\n4,047\n \nInterest-bearing deposits with banks\n112,957\n \n87,665\n \nSecurities purchased under resale agreements\n6,679\n \n6,692\n \nTrading account assets\n768\n \n773\n \nInvestment securities available-for-sale (less allowance for credit losses of $\n0\n  and $\n0\n)\n58,895\n \n44,526\n \nInvestment securities held-to-maturity (less allowance for credit losses of $\n0\n and $\n1\n)  (fair value of $\n41,906\n  and $\n51,503\n)\n47,727\n \n57,117\n \nLoans (less allowance for credit losses on loans of \n$\n174\n and $\n135\n)\n43,026\n \n36,496\n \nPremises and equipment (net of accumulated depreciation of \n$\n6,461\n and $\n6,062\n)\n2,715\n \n2,399\n \nAccrued interest and fees receivable\n4,034\n \n3,806\n \nGoodwill\n7,691\n \n7,611\n \nOther intangible assets\n1,089\n \n1,320\n \nOther assets\n64,514\n \n44,806\n \nTotal assets\n$\n353,240\n \n$\n297,258\n \nLiabilities:\nDeposits:\nNon-interest-bearing\n$\n33,180\n \n$\n32,569\n \nInterest-bearing -

State Street Corporation, the Parent Company, is a financial holding company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in these notes to consolidated financial statements to “State Street,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar references mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including our principal banking subsidiary, State Street Bank.\nWe have \ntwo\n lines of business:\nInvestment Servicing\n provides a broad range of services and market and financing solutions to institutional clients, including mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, investment managers, foundations and endowments worldwide.\nThrough State Street Investment Services, State Street Global Markets\n®\n and State Street Alpha\n®\n, we offer a full range of back- and middle-office solutions, including custody, accounting and fund administration services for traditional and alternative assets, as well as multi-asset class investments; recordkeeping, client reporting and investment book of record, transaction management, loans, cash, derivatives and collateral services; investor services operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; financial data management to support institutional investors; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance, including prime services products; and deposit and short-term investment facilities.\nTogether with our middle- and back-office services, CRD’s front- and middle-office technology offerings form the foundation of State Street Alpha\n®\n.

Our investment management solutions include strategies across equity, fixed income, cash, multi-asset and alternatives; products such as SPDR® ETFs and index funds; and services including defined benefit, defined contribution, and Outsourced Chief Investment Officer.\n \nConsolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company and its majority- and wholly-owned and otherwise controlled subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation.\nWe consolidate subsidiaries in which we exercise control. Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, recorded in other assets, generally are accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of the investee. For investments accounted for under the equity method, our share of income or loss is recorded in other fee revenue in our consolidated statement of income. Investments not meeting the criteria for equity-method treatment are measured at fair value through earnings, except for investments where a fair market value is not readily available, which are accounted for under the cost method of accounting.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of our significant accounting policies that may materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses. As a result of unanticipated events or circumstances, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe assets and liabilities of our operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are \n State Street Corporation | 128\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ntranslated at month-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated at rates that approximate average monthly exchange rates. Gains or losses from the translation of the net assets of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, net of related taxes, are recorded in AOCI, a component of shareholders’ equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and due from banks.\nSanctions programs or government intervention may inhibit our ability to access cash and due from banks in certain accounts. For example, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we held such accounts in Russia that were subject to sanctions restrictions, inclusive of \n$\n0.8\n billion\n and $\n1.5\n billion, respectively, with our subcustodian, which is an affiliate of a large multinational bank, and with western European-based clearing agencies, for a total of approximately \n$\n1.3\n billion\n and $\n1.9\n billion, respectively. The reduction in balances with our subcustodian in Russia was a result of various actions taken related to our contractual arrangements that resulted in the derecognition of certain cash balances and related client liabilities. Cash and due from banks is evaluated as part of our allowance for credit losses.\nInterest-Bearing Deposits with Banks\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks generally consist of highly liquid, short-term investments maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank and other non-U.S. central banks with original maturities at the time of purchase of one month or less.\nSecurities Purchased Under Resale Agreements and Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements and sold under repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions, and are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or repurchased, plus accrued interest. Our policy is to take possession or control of securities underlying resale agreements either directly or through agent banks, allowing borrowers the right of collateral substitution and/or short-notice termination. We revalue these securities daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower to protect us against credit exposure. We \ncan use these securities as collateral for repurchase agreements.\nFor securities sold under repurchase agreements collateralized by our investment securities portfolio, the dollar value of the securities remains in investment securities in our consolidated statement of condition. Where a master netting agreement exists or when both parties are members of a common clearing organization, resale and repurchase agreements are recorded on a net basis when specific netting criteria are met.\nFee and Net Interest Income\nThe majority of fees from investment servicing, investment management, securities finance, trading services and certain types of software and processing fees are recorded in our consolidated statement of income based on the consideration specified in contracts with our customers, and excludes taxes collected from customers subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. We recognize revenue as the services are performed or at a point in time depending on the nature of the services provided. Payments made to third party service providers are generally recognized on a gross basis when we control those services and are deemed to be the principal. Additional information about revenue from contracts with customers is provided in Note 25.\nInterest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities are recorded in our consolidated statement of income as components of NII, and are generally based on the effective yield of the related financial asset or liability.\nOther Significant Policies\nThe following table identifies our other significant accounting policies and the note and page where a detailed description of each policy can be found:\nFair Value\nNote\n2\nPage\n130\nInvestment Securities\nNote\n3\nPage\n136\nLoans and Allowance for Credit Losses\nNote\n4\nPage\n141\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nNote\n5\nPage\n146\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nNote\n10\nPage\n150\nOffsetting Arrangements\nNote\n11\nPage\n154\nContingencies\nNote\n13\nPage\n158\nVariable Interest Entities\nNote\n14\nPage\n159\nEquity-Based Compensation\nNote\n18\nPage\n165\nIncome Taxes\nNote\n22\nPage\n169\nEarnings Per Common Share\nNote\n23\nPage\n170\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nNote\n25\nPage\n173\n State Street Corporation | 129\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRecent Accounting Developments\nRelevant standards that were adopted during the year ended December 31, 2024:\nWe adopted ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, effective December 31, 2024. The standard expands the reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This includes disclosure of segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and other segment items that are included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The standard requires disclosure of the CODM’s title and position and how the CODM uses the reported measure of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and allocating resources.

Specified information includes expense amounts relating to purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and selling expenses with the definition thereof.\nAnnual reporting for period ending December 31, 2027 and for interim reporting in 2028\nWe are currently evaluating the disclosure impact of the new standard.\nASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nThe amendments related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures and require disclosures of  (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. Additional amendments require (1) disclosures of pretax income (or loss) and income tax expense (or benefit) to be consistent with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and (2) remove disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial or relevant.\nAnnual reporting for period ending December 31, 2025\nWe are currently evaluating the disclosure impact of the new standard.\nAdditionally, we continue to evaluate other accounting standards that were recently issued, but not yet adopted as of December 31, 2024; none are expected to have a material impact to our financial statements.\nNote 2.    \nFair Value\nFair Value Measurements\nWe carry trading account assets and liabilities, AFS debt securities, certain equity securities and various types of derivative financial instruments, at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis. Changes in the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of AOCI within shareholders’ equity in our consolidated statement of condition.\nWe measure fair value for the above-described financial assets and liabilities in conformity with U.S. GAAP that governs the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments. Management believes that its valuation techniques and underlying assumptions used to measure fair value conform to the provisions of U.S. GAAP. We categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value based on a prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). If the inputs used to measure a financial asset or liability cross different levels of the hierarchy, categorization is based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair-value measurement. Management’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the overall fair-value measurement of a financial asset or liability requires judgment, and considers factors specific to that asset or liability. The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are described below.\nLevel 1. Financial assets and liabilities with values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.\n Our level 1 financial assets and liabilities primarily include positions in U.S. government securities and highly liquid U.S. and non-U.S. government fixed-income securities. Our level 1 financial assets also include actively traded exchange-traded equity securities.\nLevel 2. Financial assets and liabilities with values based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n Level 2 inputs include the following:\n▪\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\n▪\nQuoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets;\n▪\nPricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and\n State Street Corporation | 130\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n▪\nPricing models whose inputs are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market information through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nOur level 2 financial assets and liabilities primarily include non-U.S. debt securities carried in trading account assets and various types of fixed-income AFS investment securities, as well as various types of foreign exchange and interest rate derivative instruments.\nFair value for our AFS investment securities categorized in level 2 is measured primarily using information obtained from independent third parties. This third-party information is subject to review by management as part of a validation process, which includes obtaining an understanding of the underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions. In addition, management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information. Such information may include known trades or, to the extent that trading activity is limited, comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations, execution prices and the timing of cash flows and, where information is available, back-testing.\nDerivative instruments categorized in level 2 predominantly represent foreign exchange contracts used in our trading activities, for which fair value is measured using discounted cash-flow techniques, with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points, as well as observable interest rate curves. With respect to derivative instruments, we evaluate the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties. We consider factors such as the likelihood of default by our counterparties, our current and potential future net exposures and remaining maturities in determining the fair value. Valuation adjustments associated with derivative instruments were not material to those instruments for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nLevel 3. Financial assets and liabilities with values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable in the market and significant to the overall measurement of fair value.\n These inputs reflect management’s judgment about the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing the financial asset or liability, and are based on the best available information, some of which may be internally developed. The following provides a more detailed discussion of our financial assets and liabilities that we may categorize in level 3 and the related valuation methodology:\n•\nThe fair value of certain foreign exchange contracts, primarily options, is measured using an option-pricing model. Because of a limited number of observable transactions, certain model inputs are not observable, such as implied volatility surface, but are derived from observable market information.\nOur level 3 financial assets and liabilities are similar in structure and profile to our level 1 and level 2 financial instruments, but they trade in less liquid markets, and the measurement of their fair value is therefore less observable.\n State Street Corporation | 131\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables present information with respect to our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated:\nFair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis\nAs of December 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nQuoted Market\nPrices in Active\nMarkets\n(Level 1)\nPricing Methods\nwith Significant\nObservable\nMarket Inputs\n(Level 2)\nPricing Methods\nwith Significant\nUnobservable\nMarket Inputs\n(Level 3)\nImpact of Netting\n(1)\nTotal Net\nCarrying Value\nin Consolidated\nStatement of\nCondition\nAssets:\nTrading account assets:\nU.S. government securities\n$\n34\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n34\n \nNon-U.S. government securities\n—\n \n121\n \n—\n \n121\n \nOther\n—\n \n613\n \n—\n \n613\n \nTotal trading account assets\n34\n \n734\n \n—\n \n768\n \nAvailable-for-sale investment securities:\nU.S. Treasury and federal agencies:\nDirect obligations\n23,525\n \n—\n \n—\n \n23,525\n \nMortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n10,566\n \n—\n \n10,566\n \nTotal U.S. Treasury and federal agencies\n23,525\n \n10,566\n \n—\n \n34,091\n \nNon-U.S. debt securities:\nMortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n2,430\n \n—\n \n2,430\n \nAsset-backed securities\n—\n \n1,868\n \n—\n \n1,868\n \nNon-U.S. sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency\n—\n \n13,939\n \n—\n \n13,939\n \nOther\n—\n \n2,821\n \n—\n \n2,821\n \nTotal non-U.S. debt securities\n—\n \n21,058\n \n—\n \n21,058\n \nAsset-backed securities:\nStudent loans\n—\n \n90\n \n—\n \n90\n \nCollateralized loan obligations\n—\n \n3,453\n \n—\n \n3,453\n \nNon-agency CMBS and RMBS\n(2)\n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \nOther\n—\n \n91\n \n—\n \n91\n \nTotal asset-backed securities\n—\n \n3,638\n \n—\n \n3,638\n \nState and political subdivisions\n—\n \n56\n \n—\n \n56\n \nOther U.S. debt securities\n—\n \n52\n \n—\n \n52\n \nTotal available-for-sale investment securities\n23,525\n \n35,370\n \n—\n \n58,895\n \nOther assets:\nDerivative instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\n16\n \n29,422\n \n1\n \n$\n(\n18,262\n)\n11,177\n \nInterest rate contracts\n5\n \n23\n \n—\n \n(\n23\n)\n5\n \nOther derivative contracts\n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \nTotal derivative instruments\n22\n \n29,445\n \n1\n \n(\n18,285\n)\n11,183\n \nOther\n20\n \n747\n \n—\n \n—\n \n767\n \nTotal assets carried at fair value\n$\n23,601\n \n$\n66,296\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n(\n18,285\n)\n$\n71,613\n \nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities:\nDerivative instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n—\n \n$\n28,904\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n22,527\n)\n$\n6,377\n \nInterest rate contracts\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n—\n \nOther derivative contracts\n—\n \n219\n \n—\n \n—\n \n219\n \nTotal derivative instruments\n—\n \n29,124\n \n—\n \n(\n22,528\n)\n6,596\n \nTotal liabilities carried at fair value\n$\n—\n \n$\n29,124\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n22,528\n)\n$\n6,596\n \n(1) \nRepresents counterparty netting against level 2 financial assets and liabilities where a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between us and the counterparty.

Disclosure of fair value estimates is not required by U.S. GAAP for certain items, such as lease financing, equity-method investments, obligations for pension and other post-retirement plans, premises and equipment, other intangible assets and income-tax assets and liabilities. Accordingly, aggregate fair-value estimates presented do not purport to represent, and should not be considered representative of, our underlying “market” or franchise value. In addition, because of potential differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values, our estimates of fair value should not be compared to those of other financial institutions.\nWe use the following methods to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments:\n•\nFor financial instruments that have quoted market prices, those quoted prices are used to estimate fair value;\n•\nFor financial instruments that have no defined maturity, have a remaining maturity of 180 days or less, or reprice frequently to a market rate, we assume that the fair value of these instruments approximates their reported value, after taking into consideration any applicable credit risk; and\n•\nFor financial instruments for which no quoted market prices are available, fair value is estimated using information obtained from independent third parties, or by discounting the expected cash flows using an estimated current market interest rate for the financial instrument.\nThe generally short duration of certain of our assets and liabilities results in a significant number of financial instruments for which fair value equals or closely approximates the amount recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. These financial instruments are reported in the following captions in our consolidated statement of condition: cash and due from banks; interest-bearing deposits with banks; securities purchased under resale agreements; accrued interest and fees receivable; deposits; securities sold under repurchase agreements; federal funds purchased; and other short-term borrowings.\nIn addition, due to the relatively short duration of certain of our loans, we consider fair value for these loans to approximate their reported value. The fair value of other types of loans, such as leveraged loans, commercial real estate loans, purchased receivables and municipal loans is estimated using information obtained from independent third parties or by discounting expected future cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. Commitments to lend have no reported value because their terms are at prevailing market rates.\n State Street Corporation | 134\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables present the reported amounts and estimated fair values of the financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, as they would be categorized within the fair value hierarchy, as of the dates indicated:\n \nFair Value Hierarchy\n(In millions)\nReported Amount \nEstimated Fair Value\nQuoted Market Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)\nPricing Methods with Significant Observable Market Inputs (Level 2) \nPricing Methods with Significant Unobservable Market Inputs (Level 3)\nDecember 31, 2024\nFinancial Assets:\n \n \n \n \nCash and due from banks\n$\n3,145\n \n$\n3,145\n \n$\n3,145\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nInterest-bearing deposits with banks\n112,957\n \n112,957\n \n—\n \n112,957\n \n—\n \nSecurities purchased under resale agreements\n6,679\n \n6,679\n \n—\n \n6,679\n \n—\n \nInvestment securities held-to-maturity\n47,727\n \n41,906\n \n5,354\n \n36,552\n \n—\n \nNet loans\n(1)\n43,026\n \n42,839\n \n—\n \n41,097\n \n1,742\n \nOther\n(2)\n6,752\n \n6,752\n \n—\n \n6,752\n \n—\n \nFinancial Liabilities:\nDeposits:\n   Non-interest-bearing\n$\n33,180\n \n$\n33,180\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n33,180\n \n$\n—\n \n   Interest-bearing - U.S.\n166,483\n \n166,483\n \n—\n \n166,483\n \n—\n \n   Interest-bearing - non-U.S.\n62,257\n \n62,257\n \n—\n \n62,257\n \n—\n \nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements\n3,681\n \n3,681\n \n—\n \n3,681\n \n—\n \nOther short-term borrowings\n9,840\n \n9,840\n \n—\n \n9,840\n \n—\n \nLong-term debt\n23,272\n \n23,078\n \n—\n \n22,882\n \n196\n \nOther\n(2)\n6,752\n \n6,752\n \n—\n \n6,752\n \n—\n \n(1)\n Includes $\n14\n million of loans classified as held-for-sale that were measured at fair value in level 2 as of December 31, 2024.\n(2) \nRepresents a portion of underlying client assets related to our prime services business, which clients have allowed us to transfer and re-pledge.\nFair Value Hierarchy\n(In millions)\nReported Amount \nEstimated Fair Value\nQuoted Market Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)\nPricing Methods with Significant Observable Market Inputs (Level 2) \nPricing Methods with Significant Unobservable Market Inputs (Level 3)\nDecember 31, 2023\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and due from banks\n$\n4,047\n \n$\n4,047\n \n$\n4,047\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nInterest-bearing deposits with banks\n87,665\n \n87,665\n \n—\n \n87,665\n \n—\n \nSecurities purchased under resale agreements\n6,692\n \n6,692\n \n—\n \n6,692\n \n—\n \nInvestment securities held-to-maturity\n57,117\n \n51,503\n \n8,409\n \n43,094\n \n—\n \nNet loans\n36,496\n \n36,335\n \n—\n \n34,308\n \n2,027\n \nOther\n(1)\n6,866\n \n6,866\n \n—\n \n6,866\n \n—\n \nFinancial Liabilities:\nDeposits:\n   Non-interest-bearing\n$\n32,569\n \n$\n32,569\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n32,569\n \n$\n—\n \n   Interest-bearing - U.S.\n121,738\n \n121,738\n \n—\n \n121,738\n \n—\n \n   Interest-bearing - non-U.S.\n66,663\n \n66,663\n \n—\n \n66,663\n \n—\n \nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements\n1,867\n \n1,867\n \n—\n \n1,867\n \n—\n \nOther short-term borrowings\n3,660\n \n3,660\n \n—\n \n3,660\n \n—\n \nLong-term debt\n18,839\n \n18,417\n \n—\n \n18,216\n \n201\n \nOther\n(1)\n6,866\n \n6,866\n \n—\n \n6,866\n \n—\n \n(1)\n Represents a portion of underlying client assets related to our prime services business, which clients have allowed us to transfer and re-pledge.\n State Street Corporation | 135\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 3.    \nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities held by us are classified as either trading account assets, AFS, HTM or equity securities held at fair value at the time of purchase and reassessed periodically, based on management’s intent.\nGenerally, trading assets are debt and equity securities purchased in connection with our trading activities and, as such, are expected to be sold in the near term. Our trading activities typically involve active and frequent buying and selling with the objective of generating profits on short-term movements. AFS investment securities are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time. AFS investment securities include securities utilized as part of our asset and liability management activities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment risk, liquidity needs or other factors. HTM securities are debt securities that management has the intent and the ability to hold to maturity.\nTrading assets are carried at fair value. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading assets are recorded in other fee revenue in our consolidated statement of income. AFS securities are carried at fair value, with any allowance for credit losses recorded through the consolidated statement of income and after-tax net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in AOCI. Gains or losses realized on sales of AFS investment securities are computed using the specific identification method and are recorded in gains (losses) from sales of available-for-sale securities, net, in our consolidated statement of income. HTM investment securities are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, with any allowance for credit losses recorded through the consolidated statement of income.\n State Street Corporation | 136\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the amortized cost, fair value and associated unrealized gains and losses of AFS and HTM investment securities as of the dates indicated:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nAmortized\nCost\nGross\nUnrealized\nFair\nValue\nAmortized\nCost\nGross\nUnrealized\nFair\nValue\n(In millions)\nGains\nLosses\nGains\nLosses\nAvailable-for-sale:\nU.S. Treasury and federal agencies:\nDirect obligations\n$\n23,539\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n52\n \n$\n23,525\n \n$\n8,427\n \n$\n39\n \n$\n165\n \n$\n8,301\n \nMortgage-backed securities\n(1)\n10,699\n \n21\n \n154\n \n10,566\n \n10,870\n \n49\n \n164\n \n10,755\n \nTotal U.S. Treasury and federal agencies\n34,238\n \n59\n \n206\n \n34,091\n \n19,297\n \n88\n \n329\n \n19,056\n \nNon-U.S. debt securities:\nMortgage-backed securities\n2,426\n \n5\n \n1\n \n2,430\n \n1,861\n \n3\n \n7\n \n1,857\n \nAsset-backed securities\n(2)\n1,865\n \n5\n \n2\n \n1,868\n \n2,148\n \n2\n \n13\n \n2,137\n \nNon-U.S. sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency\n13,954\n \n54\n \n69\n \n13,939\n \n15,159\n \n73\n \n132\n \n15,100\n \nOther\n(3)\n2,787\n \n38\n \n4\n \n2,821\n \n2,733\n \n39\n \n37\n \n2,735\n \nTotal non-U.S. debt securities\n21,032\n \n102\n \n76\n \n21,058\n \n21,901\n \n117\n \n189\n \n21,829\n \nAsset-backed securities:\nStudent loans\n(4)\n89\n \n1\n \n—\n \n90\n \n113\n \n1\n \n—\n \n114\n \nCollateralized loan obligations\n(5)\n3,447\n \n6\n \n—\n \n3,453\n \n90\n \n—\n \n—\n \n90\n \nNon-agency CMBS and RMBS\n(6)\n1\n \n3\n \n—\n \n4\n \n252\n \n—\n \n3\n \n249\n \nOther\n90\n \n1\n \n—\n \n91\n \n2,530\n \n3\n \n6\n \n2,527\n \nTotal asset-backed securities\n3,627\n \n11\n \n—\n \n3,638\n \n2,985\n \n4\n \n9\n \n2,980\n \nState and political subdivisions\n56\n \n—\n \n—\n \n56\n \n356\n \n—\n \n1\n \n355\n \nOther U.S. debt securities\n(7)\n53\n \n—\n \n1\n \n52\n \n314\n \n—\n \n8\n \n306\n \nTotal available-for-sale securities\n(8)(9)\n$\n59,006\n \n$\n172\n \n$\n283\n \n$\n58,895\n \n$\n44,853\n \n$\n209\n \n$\n536\n \n$\n44,526\n \nHeld-to-maturity:\nU.S. Treasury and federal agencies:\nDirect obligations\n$\n5,417\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n5,362\n \n$\n8,584\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n163\n \n$\n8,421\n \nMortgage-backed securities\n(10)\n36,101\n \n2\n \n5,677\n \n30,426\n \n39,472\n \n7\n \n5,271\n \n34,208\n \nTotal U.S. Treasury and federal agencies\n41,518\n \n2\n \n5,732\n \n35,788\n \n48,056\n \n7\n \n5,434\n \n42,629\n \nNon-U.S. debt securities:\nNon-U.S. sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency\n3,673\n \n7\n \n73\n \n3,607\n \n5,757\n \n8\n \n153\n \n5,612\n \nTotal non-U.S. debt securities\n3,673\n \n7\n \n73\n \n3,607\n \n5,757\n \n8\n \n153\n \n5,612\n \nAsset-backed securities:\nStudent loans\n(4)\n2,536\n \n4\n \n29\n \n2,511\n \n3,298\n \n2\n \n62\n \n3,238\n \nNon-agency CMBS and RMBS\n(11)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n6\n \n18\n \n—\n \n24\n \nTotal asset-backed securities\n2,536\n \n4\n \n29\n \n2,511\n \n3,304\n \n20\n \n62\n \n3,262\n \nTotal held-to-maturity securities\n(8)(12)\n$\n47,727\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n5,834\n \n$\n41,906\n \n$\n57,117\n \n$\n35\n \n$\n5,649\n \n$\n51,503\n \n(1)\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total fair value included $\n4.36\n billion and $\n5.54\n billion, respectively, of agency CMBS and $\n6.20\n billion and $\n5.21\n billion, respectively, of agency MBS.\n(2) \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value includes non-U.S. collateralized loan obligations of $\n0.70\n billion and $\n1.02\n billion, respectively. \n(3)\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value includes non-U.S. corporate bonds of $\n2.54\n billion and $\n2.36\n billion, respectively.\n(4)\n Primarily comprised of securities guaranteed by the federal government with respect to at le\nast \n97\n% of defaulted principal and accrued interest on the underlying loans.\n(5)\n Excludes collateralized loan obligations in loan form.

Our assessment of impairment involves an evaluation of economic and security-specific factors. Such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. To the extent that market conditions are worse than management’s expectations or due to idiosyncratic bond performance, the credit-related component of impairment, in particular, could increase and would be recorded in the provision for credit losses.\nWe conduct quarterly reviews of HTM securities on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist to determine whether an allowance for credit losses should be recognized. HTM securities are evaluated for expected credit loss utilizing a probability of default methodology, or discounted cash flows assessed against the amortized cost of the investment security excluding accrued interest. \nWe monitor the credit quality of the HTM investment securities using a variety of methods, including both external and internal credit ratings.\nWith respect to certain classes of debt securities, primarily U.S. Treasuries and agency securities (mainly issued by U.S. Government entities and agencies, as well as Group of Seven sovereigns), we consider the history of credit losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may indicate that the expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is or continues to be zero. Therefore, for those securities, we do not record expected credit losses. \n As of December 31, 2024, we had \nno\n allowance for credit losses on HTM investment securities. As of December 31, 2023, we had $\n1\n million allowance for credit losses on HTM investment securities.\nWe have elected to not record an allowance on accrued interest for HTM securities. Accrued interest on these securities is reversed against interest income when payment on a security is delinquent for greater than 90 days from the date of payment.\nAn AFS security is impaired when the current fair value of an individual security is below its amortized cost basis. An allowance for credit losses on impaired AFS securities is recorded when the present value of expected future cash flows of the investment security is less than its amortized cost basis, limited to the amount by which the security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value. \nInvestment securities will be written down to fair value through the consolidated statement of income when management intends to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recover in value.\nOur review of AFS investment securities for credit impairment generally includes:\n•\nthe identification and evaluation of securities that have indications of potential impairment, such as issuer-specific concerns, including deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy; \n•\nthe analysis of expected future cash flows of securities, based on quantitative and qualitative factors;\n•\nthe analysis of the collectability of those future cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts;\n•\nthe analysis of the underlying collateral for MBS and ABS;\n•\nthe analysis of individual impaired securities, including the anticipated recovery period and the magnitude of the overall price decline;\n•\nevaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual securities to be deemed impaired and those that would not support impairment; and\n•\ndocumentation of the results of these analyses.\nAs of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had \nno\n allowance for credit losses on AFS investment securities.\nSubstantially all of our investment securities portfolio is composed of debt securities. A critical component of our assessment of impairment of these debt securities is the identification of credit-impaired securities for which management does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.\n As of December 31, 2024, \n99\n% of our HTM and AFS investment portfolio is publicly rated investment grade. \nAfter a review of the investment portfolio, taking into consideration then-current economic conditions, adverse situations that might affect our ability to fully collect principal and interest, the timing of future payments, the credit quality and performance of the collateral underlying MBS and ABS and other relevant factors, management considered the aggregate decline in fair value of the investment securities portfolio and the resulting gross pre-tax unrealized losses of $\n6.12\n billion and $\n6.19\n billion related to \n1,564\n and \n1,704\n securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to be primarily related to changes in interest rates, and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the \n State Street Corporation | 140\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nsecurities. The unrealized loss has not been recognized as of December 31, 2024, as management did not have the intent to sell, nor was it more likely than not that we would be required to sell these securities before the expected recovery of their amortized cost basis.\nNote 4.    \nLoans and Allowance for Credit Losses\nLoans are generally recorded at their principal amount outstanding, net of the allowance for credit losses, unearned income, and any net unamortized deferred loan origination fees. Loans that are classified as held-for-sale are measured at lower of cost or fair value on an individual basis.\nInterest income related to loans is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan. Fees received for providing loan commitments and letters of credit that we anticipate will result in loans typically are deferred and amortized to interest income over the term of the related loan, beginning with the initial borrowing. Fees on commitments and letters of credit are amortized to software and processing fees over the commitment period when funding is not known or expected.\nThe following table presents our recorded investment in loans, by segment, as of the dates indicated:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDomestic\n(1)\n:\nCommercial and financial:\nFund finance\n(2)\n$\n16,347\n \n$\n13,697\n \nLeveraged loans\n2,742\n \n2,412\n \nOverdrafts\n1,208\n \n1,225\n \nCollateralized loan obligations in loan form\n50\n \n150\n \nOther\n(3)\n3,220\n \n2,512\n \nCommercial real estate\n2,842\n \n3,069\n \nTotal domestic\n26,409\n \n23,065\n \nForeign\n(1)\n:\nCommercial and financial:\nFund finance\n(2)\n6,601\n \n4,956\n \nLeveraged loans\n1,082\n \n1,194\n \nOverdrafts\n772\n \n1,047\n \nCollateralized loan obligations in loan form\n8,336\n \n6,369\n \nTotal foreign\n16,791\n \n13,566\n \nTotal loans\n(4)\n43,200\n \n36,631\n \nAllowance for credit losses\n(\n174\n)\n(\n135\n)\nLoans, net of allowance\n$\n43,026\n \n$\n36,496\n \n(1)\n Domestic and foreign categorization is based on the borrower’s country of domicile.\n(2) \nFund finance loans include primarily $\n11.54\n billion private equity capital call finance loans, $\n8.09\n billion loans to real money funds and $\n1.44\n billion loans to business development companies as of December 31, 2024, compared to $\n9.69\n billion private equity capital call finance loans,  $\n6.63\n billion loans to real money funds and $\n1.05\n billion loans to business development companies as of December 31, 2023.\n(3) \nIncludes $\n3.01\n billion securities finance loans and $\n214\n million loans to municipalities as of December 31, 2024 and $\n2.23\n billion securities finance loans, $\n276\n million loans to municipalities and $\n5\n million other loans as of December 31, 2023.\n(4)\n As of December 31, 2024, excluding overdrafts, floating rate loans totaled $\n38.46\n billion and fixed rate loans totaled $\n2.76\n billion. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with EURIBOR indexed floating-rate loans. See Note 10 for additional details.\nWe segregate our loans into \ntwo\n segments: commercial and financial loans and commercial real estate loans. We further classify commercial and financial loans as fund finance loans, leveraged loans, collateralized loan obligations in loan form, overdrafts and other loans. Fund finance loans are composed of revolving credit lines providing liquidity and leverage to mutual fund and private equity fund clients. These classifications reflect their risk characteristics, their initial measurement attributes and the methods we use to monitor and assess credit risk. \nCertain loans are pledged as collateral for access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the loans pledged as collateral totaled $\n13.90\n billion and $\n13.00\n billion, respectively.\nWe generally place loans on non-accrual status once principal or interest payments are 90 days contractually past due, or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable. Loans 90 days past due, but considered both well-secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non-accrual status. When we place a loan on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is discontinued and previously recorded but unpaid interest is reversed and generally charged against interest income. For loans on non-accrual status, income is recognized on a cash basis after recovery of principal, if and when interest payments are received. Loans may be removed from non-accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and performance under the terms of the loan has been demonstrated. As of December 31, 2024, we had \ntwo\n loans totaling $\n191\n million on non-accrual status, of which \none\n loan totaling $\n101\n million was more than 90 days contractually past due. As of December 31, 2023, we had \nthree\n loans totaling $\n70\n million on non-accrual status. \nIn 2024, we purchased $\n3.72\n billion of collateralized loan obligations in loan form, which were all investment grade as of December 31, 2024.\nWe sold $\n300\n million of loans in 2024. We recorded a charge-off against the allowance for these loans of $\n37\n million in 2024. \nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe recognize an allowance for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326 for financial assets held at amortized cost and off-balance sheet commitments. The allowance for credit losses is reviewed on a regular basis, and any provision for credit losses is recorded to reflect the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for expected credit losses at a level which represents what management does not expect to recover due to expected credit losses. For additional discussion on the allowance for credit \n State Street Corporation | 141\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nlosses for investment securities, please refer to Note 3.\nWhen the allowance is recorded, a provision for credit loss expense is recognized in net income. The allowance for credit losses for financial assets (excluding investment securities, as discussed in Note 3) represents the portion of the amortized cost basis, including accrued interest for financial assets held at amortized cost, which management does not expect to recover due to expected credit losses and is presented on the statement of condition as an offset to the amortized cost basis. The accrued interest balance is presented separately on the statement of condition within accrued interest and fees receivable. The allowance for off-balance sheet commitments is presented within other liabilities. Loans are charged off to the allowance for credit losses in the reporting period in which either an event occurs that confirms the existence of a loss on a loan, including a sale of a loan below its carrying value, or a portion of a loan is determined to be uncollectible.\nThe allowance for credit losses may be determined using various methods, including discounted cash flow methods, loss-rate methods, probability-of-default methods, and other quantitative or qualitative methods as determined by us. The method used to estimate expected credit losses may vary depending on the type of financial asset, our ability to predict the timing of cash flows, and the information available to us.\nThe allowance for credit losses as reported in our consolidated statement of condition is adjusted by the provision for credit losses, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of principal amounts, net of recoveries.\nWe measure expected credit losses of financial assets on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Each reporting period, we assess whether the assets in the pool continue to display similar risk characteristics.\nFor a financial asset that does not share risk characteristics with other assets, expected credit losses are measured separately using one or more of the methods noted above. As of December 31, 2024, we had \n4\n loans totaling $\n48\n million in the commercial and financial segment and \n5\n loans totaling $\n402\n million in the commercial real estate segment that no longer met the similar risk characteristics of their collective pool. As of December 31, 2024, $\n91\n million of our allowance for credit losses was related to these loans.\nWhen the asset is collateral-dependent, which means when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses are \ndetermined based on the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for the estimated costs to sell.\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods.\nWe estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset, while factoring in prepayment activity, where supported by data, over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period. We utilize a baseline, upside and downside scenario which are applied based on a probability weighting, in order to better reflect management’s expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment. The multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon (or less depending on contractual maturity) and then revert linearly over a two year period to a ten-year historical average thereafter. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications, but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable. \nAs part of our allowance methodology, we establish qualitative reserves to address any risks inherent in our portfolio that are not addressed through our quantitative reserve assessment. These factors may relate to, among other things, legislation changes or new regulation, credit concentration, loan markets, scenario weighting and overall model limitations. The qualitative adjustments are applied to our portfolio of financial instruments under the existing governance structure and are inherently judgmental.\nCredit Quality\nCredit quality for financial assets held at amortized cost is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses. \nWe use an internal risk-rating system to assess our risk of credit loss for each loan. This risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment. Qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a systematic manner, and following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our credit scale is assigned.\nWhen computing allowance levels, credit loss assumptions are estimated using models that categorize asset pools based on loss history, delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the \n State Street Corporation | 142\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nallowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, evaluations of the overall asset portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods.\nCredit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes in order to enable timely detection of any concerns with the customer’s credit rating. The results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and transactions with counterparties and in our process for estimation of expected credit losses.\nIn assessing the risk rating assigned to each individual loan, among the factors considered are the borrower's debt capacity, collateral coverage, payment history and delinquency experience, financial flexibility and earnings strength, the expected amounts and source of repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, if any, and the industry and geography in which the borrower operates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Credit counterparties are evaluated and risk-rated on an individual basis at least annually. Management considers the ratings to be current as of December 31, 2024.\nOur internal risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings to counterparties ranging from Investment Grade, Speculative, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful and Loss.\n•\nInvestment Grade: Counterparties with strong credit quality and low expected credit risk and probability of default. Approximately \n88\n% of our loans were rated as investment grade as of December 31, 2024 with external credit ratings, or equivalent, of “BBB-” or better.\n•\nSpeculative: Counterparties that have the ability to repay but face significant uncertainties, such as adverse business or financial circumstances that could affect credit risk or economic downturns. Loans to counterparties rated as speculative account for approximately \n11\n% of our loans as of December 31, 2024, and are concentrated in leveraged loans. Approximately \n91\n% of those leveraged loans have an external credit rating, or equivalent, of “BB” or “B” as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nSpecial Mention: Counterparties with potential weaknesses that, if uncorrected, may result in deterioration of repayment prospects.\n•\nSubstandard: Counterparties with well-defined weakness that jeopardizes \nrepayment with the possibility we will sustain some loss. \n•\nDoubtful: Counterparties with well-defined weakness which make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. \n•\nLoss: Counterparties which are uncollectible or have little value. \nThe following tables present our recorded loans to counterparties by risk rating, as noted above, as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31, 2024\nCommercial and Financial\nCommercial Real Estate\nTotal Loans\n(In millions)\nInvestment grade\n$\n35,831\n \n$\n1,969\n \n$\n37,800\n \nSpeculative\n4,278\n \n409\n \n4,687\n \nSpecial mention\n187\n \n62\n \n249\n \nSubstandard\n48\n \n211\n \n259\n \nDoubtful\n—\n \n191\n \n191\n \nTotal\n(1)(2)\n$\n40,344\n \n$\n2,842\n \n$\n43,186\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nCommercial and Financial\nCommercial Real Estate\nTotal Loans \n(In millions)\nInvestment grade\n$\n29,737\n \n$\n2,287\n \n$\n32,024\n \nSpeculative\n3,546\n \n449\n \n3,995\n \nSpecial mention\n242\n \n62\n \n304\n \nSubstandard\n14\n \n224\n \n238\n \nDoubtful\n23\n \n47\n \n70\n \nTotal\n(1)\n$\n33,562\n \n$\n3,069\n \n$\n36,631\n \n(1)\n Loans include $\n1.98\n billion and $\n2.27\n billion of overdrafts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024, $\n1.84\n billion overdrafts were investment grade and $\n0.14\n billion overdrafts were speculative.\n(2) \nTotal does not include $\n14\n million of loans classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2024.\nFinancial assets held at amortized cost that are not loans are disaggregated based on product type. This includes our fees receivable balance, which have had no his\ntory of credit losses, and are evaluated collectively as a pool.\nSecurities purchased under a resale agreement and securities-financing within our principal business utilize the collateral maintenance provisions included within ASC 326. An allowance for credit losses is recognized for any remaining exposure based on counterparty type.\n State Street Corporation | 143\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures, recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition, represents management’s estimate of credit losses primarily in outstanding letters and lines of credit and other credit-enhancement facilities provided to our clients and outstanding as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is evaluated quarterly by management. Factors considered in evaluating the appropriate level of this allowance are similar to those considered with respect to the allowance for credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost. Provisions to maintain the allowance at a level considered by us to be appropriate to absorb estimated credit losses in outstanding facilities are recorded in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statement of income. \nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis, by year of origination and credit quality indicator as of December 31, 2024. For origination years before the fifth annual period, we present the aggregate amortized cost basis of loans. For purchased loans, the date of issuance is used to determine the year of origination, not the date of acquisition. For modified, extended or renewed lending arrangements, we evaluate whether a credit event has occurred which would consider the loan to be a new arrangement.\n(In

provisions for credit losses that are recorded reflect management’s estimate of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. In 2024, we recorded a $\n75\n million provision for credit losses, primarily reflecting an increase in loan loss reserves associated with certain commercial real estate and leveraged loans, compared to $\n46\n million in 2023. Allowance estimates remain subject to continued model and economic uncertainty and management may use qualitative adjustments in the allowance estimates. If future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024, or if credit risk migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also change.\nNote 5.    \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased long-lived intangible assets, primarily client relationships, that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances arise or events occur that indicate an impairment of the carrying amount may exist. Other intangible assets, which are subject to evaluation for impairment, are mainly related to client relationships, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from \nfive\n to \ntwenty years\n, technology assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from \nthree\n to \nten years\n, and core deposit intangible assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from \nsixteen\n to \ntwenty-two years\n, with such amortization recorded in other expenses in our consolidated statement of income.\nImpairment of goodwill is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit, including its allocation of goodwill and other intangible assets, exceeds its estimated fair value. Impairment of other intangible assets is deemed to exist if the balance of the other intangible asset exceeds the cumulative expected undiscounted net cash inflows related to the asset over its remaining estimated useful life. If these reviews determine that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, the value of the goodwill or the other intangible asset is written down through a charge to other expenses in our consolidated statement of income.\n There wer\ne \nno\n impairments to \ngoodwill or other intangible assets in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nThe following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the periods indicated for each of our goodwill reporting units:\n(In millions)\nInvestment\nServicing\nInvestment\nManagement\nTotal\nGoodwill:\nEnding balance December 31, 2022\n$\n7,232\n \n$\n263\n \n$\n7,495\n \nAcquisitions\n44\n \n—\n \n44\n \nForeign currency translation\n70\n \n2\n \n72\n \nEnding balance December 31, 2023\n7,346\n \n265\n \n7,611\n \nAcquisitions\n(1)\n189\n \n—\n \n189\n \nForeign currency translation\n(\n107\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n109\n)\nEnding balance December 31, 2024\n$\n7,428\n \n$\n263\n \n$\n7,691\n \n(1)\n Investment Servicing includes the impact of the consolidation of one of our joint ventures in India.\n \nThe following table presents changes in the net carrying amount of other intangible assets during the periods indicated:\n(In millions)\nInvestment\nServicing\nInvestment\nManagement\nTotal\nOther intangible assets:\nEnding balance December 31, 2022\n$\n1,495\n \n$\n49\n \n$\n1,544\n \nAmortization\n(\n217\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n239\n)\nForeign currency translation\n15\n \n—\n \n15\n \nEnding balance December 31, 2023\n1,293\n \n27\n \n1,320\n \nAcquisitions\n7\n \n13\n \n20\n \nAmortization\n(\n216\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n230\n)\nForeign currency translation\n(\n21\n)\n—\n \n(\n21\n)\nEnding balance December 31, 2024\n$\n1,063\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n1,089\n \n    \n State Street Corporation | 146\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables present the gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization and net carrying amount of other intangible assets by type as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31, 2024\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Amount\n(In millions)\nOther intangible assets:\nClient relationships\n$\n2,706\n \n$\n(\n1,919\n)\n$\n787\n \nTechnology\n401\n \n(\n252\n)\n149\n \nCore deposits\n677\n \n(\n540\n)\n137\n \nOther\n95\n \n(\n79\n)\n16\n \nTotal\n$\n3,879\n \n$\n(\n2,790\n)\n$\n1,089\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Amount\n(In millions)\nOther intangible assets:\nClient relationships\n$\n2,761\n \n$\n(\n1,808\n)\n$\n953\n \nTechnology\n402\n \n(\n216\n)\n186\n \nCore deposits\n690\n \n(\n516\n)\n174\n \nOther\n85\n \n(\n78\n)\n7\n \nTotal\n$\n3,938\n \n$\n(\n2,618\n)\n$\n1,320\n \nAmortization expense related to other intangible assets was \n$\n230\n million,\n $\n239\n million and $\n238\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nExpected future amortization expense for other intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2024 is as follows:\n(In millions)\nFuture Amortization\nYears Ended December 31,\n2025\n$\n225\n \n2026\n202\n \n2027\n168\n \n2028\n122\n \n2029\n64\n \nNote 6.    \nOther Assets\nThe following table presents the components of other assets as of the dates indicated:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nSecurities borrowed\n(1)\n$\n37,451\n \n$\n23,131\n \nDerivative instruments, net\n11,183\n \n5,307\n \nBank-owned life insurance\n3,856\n \n3,742\n \nInvestments in joint ventures and other unconsolidated entities\n(2)\n3,317\n \n2,981\n \nCollateral, net\n3,216\n \n2,983\n \nRight-of-use assets\n818\n \n805\n \nPrepaid expenses\n738\n \n598\n \nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n(3)\n701\n \n1,034\n \nAccounts receivable\n504\n \n611\n \nIncome taxes receivable\n144\n \n246\n \nReceivable for securities settlement\n57\n \n1,082\n \nOther\n(4)\n2,529\n \n2,286\n \nTotal\n$\n64,514\n \n$\n44,806\n \n(1)\n Refer to Note 11, for further information on the impact of collateral on our financial statement presentation of securities borrowing and securities lending transactions.\n(2) \nIncludes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are accounted for under the ASC 321 measurement alternative of \n$\n341\n million\n and $\n183\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Refer to Note 20 for additional information.\nNote 10.    \nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments to support our clients’ needs and to manage our interest rate, currency and other market risks. These financial instruments consist of FX contracts such as forwards, futures and options contracts; interest rate contracts such as interest rate swaps (cross currency and single currency) and futures; and other derivative contracts. Derivative instruments used for risk management purposes that are highly effective in offsetting the risk being hedged are generally designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting relationships, while others are economic hedges and not designated in hedge accounting relationships. Derivatives in hedge accounting relationships are disclosed according to the type of hedge, such as fair value, cash flow or net investment. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting relationships are carried at fair value with change in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income or other comprehensive income (OCI), as appropriate. Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include those derivatives entered into to support client needs and derivatives used to manage interest rate, currency and other market risks associated with certain assets and liabilities. Such derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nWe provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of our client needs, and also act as a dealer in the currency markets. As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in both the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options, interest rate forward contracts, and interest rate futures. The entire change in the fair value of \nderivatives utilized in our trading activities are recorded in foreign exchange trading services revenue. We also utilize derivatives in our asset and liability management activities and to manage other marke\nt risks. The entire change in fair value of such derivatives are recorded in net interest income and other fee revenue, respectively.\nWe enter into stable value wrap derivative contracts with unaffiliated stable value funds that allow a stable value fund to provide book value coverage to its participants. These derivatives contracts qualify as guarantees as described in Note 12.\nWe grant deferred cash awards to certain of our employees as part of our employee incentive compensation plans. We account for these awards as derivative financial instruments, as the underlying referenced shares are not equity instruments of ours. The fair value of these derivatives is referenced to the value of units in State Street-sponsored investment funds or funds sponsored by other unrelated entities. We re-measure these derivatives to fair value quarterly, and record the change in value in compensation and employee benefits expenses in our consolidated statement of income.\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nIn connection with our asset and liability management activities, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk and foreign currency risk for certain assets and liabilities. At both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, we formally assess and document the effectiveness of a derivative designated in a hedging relationship and the likelihood that the derivative will be an effective hedge in future periods. We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the underlying risk being hedged, the derivative expires, terminates or is sold, or management discontinues the hedge designation.\nThe risk management objective of a highly effective hedging strategy that qualifies for hedge accounting must be formally documented. The hedge documentation includes the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction, type of risk being hedged and method for assessing hedge effectiveness of the derivative prospectively and retrospectively. We use quantitative methods including regression analysis and cumulative dollar offset method, comparing the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in fair value or the cash flows of the hedged item. We may also utilize qualitative methods such as matching critical terms and evaluation of any changes in those critical terms. Effectiveness is assessed and \n State Street Corporation | 150\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ndocumented quarterly and if determined that the derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated risk hedge accounting is discontinued.\nFair Value Hedges\nDerivatives designated as fair value hedges are utilized to mitigate the risk of changes in the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities, including long-term debt and AFS securities. We use interest rate and foreign exchange contracts in this manner to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items caused by changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, respectively.\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative and changes in fair value of the hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same line item. If a hedge is terminated, but the hedged item was not derecognized, all remaining adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged item are amortized over a period that is consistent with the amortization of other discounts or premiums associated with the hedged item\n. \nCash Flow Hedges\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges are utilized to offset the variability of cash flows of recognized assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions. We have entered into FX contracts to hedge the change in cash flows attributable to FX movements in foreign currency denominated investment securities. Additionally, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with EURIBOR indexed floating-rate loans, Deposit Facility Interest Rate (DFR) indexed ECB deposits and Interest Rate on Reserve Balances (IORB) indexed floating-rate cash deposits held across the Federal Reserve Bank system. The interest rate swaps synthetically convert the interest receipts from a variable-rate to a fixed-rate, thereby mitigating the risk attributable to changes in the EURIBOR, DFR and IORB.\nChanges in fair value of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in AOCI and then reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings and are presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the hedge relationship is terminated, the change in fair value on the derivative recorded in AOCI is reclassified into earnings consistent with the timing of the hedged item. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge terms, any \nrelated derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. The net loss associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of December 31, 2024 is approximately $\n136\n million. The maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is \n5\n years.\nNet Investment Hedges\nDerivatives categorized as net investment hedges are entered into to protect the net investment in our foreign operations against adverse changes in exchange rates. We use FX forward contracts to convert the foreign currency risk to U.S. dollars to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in FX rates. The changes in fair value of the FX forward contracts are recorded, net of taxes, in the foreign currency translation component of OCI.\nThe following table presents the aggregate contractual, or notional, amounts of derivative financial instruments including those entered into for trading and asset and liability management activities as of the dates indicated:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts:\nFutures\n$\n47,222\n \n$\n12,668\n \nForeign exchange contracts:\nForward, swap and spot\n2,612,945\n \n2,528,115\n \nOptions purchased\n466\n \n851\n \nOptions written\n145\n \n544\n \nFutures\n359\n \n197\n \nOther:\nFutures\n155\n \n125\n \nStable value contracts\n(1)\n25,271\n \n28,704\n \nDeferred value awards\n(2)\n253\n \n289\n \nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts:\nSwap agreements\n33,302\n \n20,333\n \nForeign exchange contracts:\nForward and swap\n10,260\n \n9,777\n \n(1)\n The notional value of the stable value contracts represents our maximum exposure.

In addition to cash collateral received and transferred presented on a net basis, we also receive and transfer collateral in the form of securities, which mitigate credit risk but are not eligible for netting. Additional information on netting is provided in Note 11.\nCredit Contingencies \nCertain of our derivatives are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties containing credit risk-related contingent features, which requires us to maintain an investment grade credit rating with the various credit rating agencies. If our rating falls below investment grade, we would be in violation of the provisions, and counterparties to the derivatives could request immediate payment or demand full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit contingent features and in a net liability position as of December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $\n7.41\n billion, against which we provided $\n5.66\n billion of collateral in the normal course of business. If our credit related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered as of December 31, 2024, the maximum additional collateral we would be required to post to our counterparties is approximately $\n1.75\n billion.\n State Street Corporation | 153\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n Note 11.    \nOffsetting Arrangements\nCertain of our transactions are subject to master netting agreements that allow us to net receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. For those legally enforceable contracts, we net receivables and payables with the same counterparty on our statement of condition.\nIn addition to netting receivables and payables with our derivatives counterparty where a legal and enforceable netting arrangement exists, we also net related cash collateral received and transferred up to the fair value exposure amount.\nWith respect to our securities financing arrangements, we net balances outstanding on our consolidated statement of condition for those transactions that met the netting requirements and were transacted under a legally enforceable netting arrangement with the counterparty.\nSecurities received as collateral under securities financing or derivatives transactions can be transferred as collateral in many instances. The securities received as proceeds under secured lending transactions are recorded at a value that approximates fair value in other assets in our consolidated statement of condition with a related liability to return the collateral, if we have the right to transfer or re-pledge the collateral.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the value of securities received as collateral from third parties where we are permitted to transfer or re-pledge the securities totaled $\n11.41\n billion and $\n10.67\n billion, respectively, and the fair value of the portion that had been transferred or re-pledged as of the same dates was $\n2.76\n billion and $\n6.41\n billion, respectively. \n \nThe following tables present information about the offsetting of assets related to derivative contracts and secured financing transactions, as of the dates indicated:\nAssets:\nDecember 31, 2024\nGross Amounts of Recognized \nAssets\n(1)(2)\nGross Amounts Offset in Statement of Condition\n(3)\nNet Amounts of Assets Presented in Statement of Condition\nGross Amounts Not Offset in Statement of Condition\n(In millions)\nCash and Securities Received\n(4)\nNet Amount\n(5)\nDerivatives:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n29,439\n \n$\n(\n16,424\n)\n$\n13,015\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n13,015\n \nInterest rate contracts\n(6)\n28\n \n(\n1\n)\n27\n \n—\n \n27\n \nOther derivative contracts\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \nCash collateral and securities netting\nNA\n(\n1,860\n)\n(\n1,860\n)\n(\n1,197\n)\n(\n3,057\n)\nTotal derivatives\n29,468\n \n(\n18,285\n)\n11,183\n \n(\n1,197\n)\n9,986\n \nOther financial instruments:\nResale agreements and securities borrowing\n(7)(8)\n276,151\n \n(\n232,021\n)\n44,130\n \n(\n42,589\n)\n1,541\n \nTotal derivatives and other financial instruments\n$\n305,619\n \n$\n(\n250,306\n)\n$\n55,313\n \n$\n(\n43,786\n)\n$\n11,527\n \n State Street Corporation | 154\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAssets:\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Amounts of Recognized \nAssets\n(1)(2)\nGross Amounts Offset in Statement of Condition\n(3)\nNet Amounts of Assets Presented in Statement of Condition\nGross Amounts Not Offset in Statement of Condition\n(In millions)\nCash and Securities Received\n(4)\nNet Amount\n(5)\nDerivatives:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n19,694\n \n$\n(\n10,496\n)\n$\n9,198\n \n$\n— \n$\n9,198\n \nInterest rate contracts\n(6)\n13\n \n—\n \n13\n \n— \n13\n \nCash collateral and securities netting\nNA\n(\n3,904\n)\n(\n3,904\n)\n(\n1,069\n)\n(\n4,973\n)\nTotal derivatives\n19,707\n \n(\n14,400\n)\n5,307\n \n(\n1,069\n)\n4,238\n \nOther financial instruments:\nResale agreements and securities borrowing\n(7)(8)\n230,384\n \n(\n200,561\n)\n29,823\n \n(\n28,016\n)\n1,807\n \nTotal derivatives and other financial instruments\n$\n250,091\n \n$\n(\n214,961\n)\n$\n35,130\n \n$\n(\n29,085\n)\n$\n6,045\n \n(1) \nAmounts include all transactions regardless of whether or not they are subject to an enforceable netting arrangement.\n(2) \nRefer to Note 1 and Note 2 for additional information about the measurement basis of derivative instruments.\n(3) \nAmounts subject to netting arrangements which have been determined to be legally enforceable and eligible for netting in the consolidated statement of condition.\n(4)\n Includes securities in connection with our securities borrowing transactions.\n(5) \nIncludes amounts secured by collateral not determined to be subject to enforceable netting arrangements.\n(6)\n Variation margin payments presented as settlements rather than collateral.\n(7) \nIncluded in the $\n44.13\n billion as of December 31, 2024 were $\n6.68\n billion of resale agreements and $\n37.45\n billion of collateral provided related to securities borrowing.

We require the review of the price of the underlying securities in relation to the carrying value of the repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements on a daily basis and when appropriate, adjust the cash or security to be obtained or returned to counterparties that is reflective of the required collateral levels. \nThe following table summarizes our repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions by category of collateral pledged and remaining maturity of these agreements as of the periods indicated:\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\n(In millions)\nOvernight and Continuous\nUp to 30 Days\n30-90 Days\nGreater than 90 Days\nTotal\nOvernight and Continuous\nUp to 30 Days\n30-90 Days\nGreater than 90 Days\nTotal\nRepurchase agreements:\nU.S. Treasury and agency securities\n$\n223,095\n \n$\n350\n \n$\n1,277\n \n$\n2,500\n \n$\n227,222\n \n$\n196,212\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n185\n \n$\n1,360\n \n$\n197,757\n \nNon-US sovereign debt\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n223,095\n \n350\n \n1,277\n \n2,500\n \n227,222\n \n196,212\n \n—\n \n185\n \n1,360\n \n197,757\n \nSecurities lending transactions:\nUS Treasury and agency securities\n152\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n152\n \n6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n6\n \nCorporate debt securities\n193\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n193\n \n278\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n281\n \nEquity securities\n11,181\n \n13\n \n—\n \n4,519\n \n15,713\n \n7,128\n \n20\n \n13\n \n2,291\n \n9,452\n \nOther\n(1)\n6,752\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n6,752\n \n6,866\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n6,866\n \nTotal\n18,278\n \n13\n \n—\n \n4,519\n \n22,810\n \n14,278\n \n20\n \n16\n \n2,291\n \n16,605\n \nGross amount of recognized liabilities for repurchase agreements and securities lending\n$\n241,373\n \n$\n363\n \n$\n1,277\n \n$\n7,019\n \n$\n250,032\n \n$\n210,490\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n201\n \n$\n3,651\n \n$\n214,362\n \n(1)\n Represents a security interest in underlying client assets related to our prime services business, which assets clients have allowed us to transfer and re-pledge.\n State Street Corporation | 156\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 12.    \nCommitments and Guarantees\nThe following table presents the aggregate gross contractual amounts of our off-balance sheet commitments and guarantees, as of the dates indicated:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCommitments:\nUnfunded credit facilities\n$\n34,191\n \n$\n34,197\n \nGuarantees\n(1)\n:\nIndemnified securities financing\n$\n310,814\n \n$\n279,916\n \nStandby letters of credit\n908\n \n1,510\n \n(1) \nThe potential losses associated with these guarantees equal the gross contractual amounts and do not consider the value of any collateral or reflect any participations to independent third parties.\nUnfunded Credit Facilities\nUnfunded credit facilities consist primarily of liquidity facilities provided to our fund and municipal counterparties, as well as commitments to purchase commercial real estate and leveraged loans that have not yet settled.\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately \n75\n% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit expire within \none year\n. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.\nIndemnified Securities Financing\nOn behalf of our clients, we lend their securities, as agent, to brokers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. We require the borrowers to maintain collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. Securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. Collateral received in connection with our securities lending services is held by us as agent and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition.\nThe cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against the loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition.\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate fair values of indemnified securities financing and related collateral, as well as collateral invested in indemnified repurchase agreements, as of the dates indicated:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair value of indemnified securities financing\n$\n310,814\n \n$\n279,916\n \nFair value of cash and securities held by us, as agent, as collateral for indemnified securities financing\n325,611\n \n293,855\n \nFair value of collateral for indemnified securities financing invested in indemnified repurchase agreements\n63,655\n \n59,028\n \nFair value of cash and securities held by us or our agents as collateral for investments in indemnified repurchase agreements\n68,507\n \n63,105\n \nIn certain cases, we participate in securities finance transactions as a principal. As a principal, we borrow securities from the lending client and then lend such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. Our right to receive and obligation to return collateral in connection with our securities lending transactions are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had approximately $\n37.45\n billion and $\n23.13\n billion, respectively, of collateral provided and approximately $\n14.33\n billion and $\n11.93\n billion, respectively, of collateral received from clients in connection with our participation in principal securities finance transactions.\nStable Value Protection\nStable value funds wrapped by us are high quality diversified portfolios of short intermediate duration fixed-income investments. Stable value contracts are derivative contracts that also qualify as guarantees. The notional amount under non-hedging derivatives, provided in Note 10, generally represents our maximum exposure under these derivatives contracts. However, exposure to various stable value contracts is contractually limited to substantially lower amounts than the notional values, which represent the total assets of the stable value funds.\nStandby Letters of Credit\nStandby letters of credit provide credit enhancement to our municipal clients to support the issuance of capital markets financing.\nFICC Guarantee\n As a sponsoring member in the FICC member program, we provide a guarantee to FICC in the event a customer fails to perform its obligations under a transaction. In order to minimize the risk associated with this guarantee, sponsored members acting as buyers generally grant a security interest in the \n State Street Corporation | 157\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nsubject securities received under and held on their behalf by State Street. \nAdditionally, as a member of certain industry clearing and settlement exchanges, we may be required to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization and provide liquidity support in the event of the default of another member to the extent that the defaulting member’s clearing fund obligation and the prescribed loss allocation is depleted. It is difficult to estimate our maximum possible exposure under the membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against us that have not yet occurred. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not record any liabilities under these arrangements. \nFor additional information on our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, please refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nNote 13.    \nContingencies\nLegal and Regulatory Matters\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are involved in disputes, litigation, and governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, both pending and threatened. These matters, if resolved adversely against us or settled, may result in monetary awards or payments, fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices. The resolution or settlement of these matters is inherently difficult to predict. Based on our assessment of these pending matters, we do not believe that the amount of any judgment, settlement or other action arising from any pending matter is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. However, an adverse outcome or development in certain of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which such matter is resolved, or an accrual is determined to be required, on our consolidated financial condition, or on our reputation. \nWe evaluate our needs for accruals of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings on a case-by-case basis. When we have a liability that we deem probable, and we deem the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated as of the date of our consolidated financial statements, we accrue our estimate of the amount of loss. We also consider a loss probable and establish an accrual when we make, or intend to make, an offer of settlement. Once established, an accrual is subject to subsequent adjustment as a result of additional information. The resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings and the amount of reasonably estimable \nloss (or range thereof) are inherently difficult to predict, especially in the early stages of proceedings. Even if a loss is probable, an amount (or range) of loss might not be reasonably estimated until the later stages of the proceeding due to many factors such as the presence of complex or novel legal theories, the discretion of governmental authorities in seeking sanctions or negotiating resolutions in civil and criminal matters, the pace and timing of discovery and other assessments of facts and the procedural posture of the matter (collectively, “factors influencing reasonable estimates”). \nAs of December 31, 2024, our aggregate accruals for loss contingencies for legal, regulatory and related matters totaled approximately \n$\n15\n million\n, including potential fines by government agencies and civil litigation with respect to the matters specifically discussed below. To the extent that we have established accruals in our consolidated statement of condition for probable loss contingencies, such accruals may not be sufficient to cover our ultimate financial exposure associated with any settlements or judgments. Any such ultimate financial exposure, or proceedings to which we may become subject in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, for those matters for which we have accrued probable loss contingencies and for other matters for which loss is reasonably possible (but not probable) in future periods, and for which we are able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, our estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss (in excess of any accrued amounts) ranges up to approximately \n$\n30\n million\n. Our estimate with respect to the aggregate reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties, which may change quickly and significantly from time to time, particularly if and as we engage with applicable governmental agencies or plaintiffs in connection with a proceeding. Also, the matters underlying the reasonably possible loss will change from time to time. As a result, actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate.\nIn certain pending matters, it is not currently feasible to reasonably estimate the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss, and such losses, which may be significant, are not included in the estimate of reasonably possible loss discussed above. This is due to, among other factors, the factors influencing reasonable estimates described above. An adverse outcome in one or more of the matters for which we have not estimated the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect \n State Street Corporation | 158\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\non our businesses, on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation. Given that our actual losses from any legal or regulatory proceeding for which we have provided an estimate of the reasonably possible loss could significantly exceed such estimate, and given that we cannot estimate reasonably possible loss for all legal and regulatory proceedings as to which we may be subject now or in the future, no conclusion as to our ultimate exposure from current pending or potential legal or regulatory proceedings should be drawn from the current estimate of reasonably possible loss. \nThe following discussion provides information with respect to significant legal, governmental and regulatory matters. \nGomes, et al. v. State Street Corp.\nEight\n participants in our Salary Savings Program filed a purported class action complaint in May 2021 on behalf of participants and beneficiaries who participated in the program and invested in our proprietary investment fund options between May 2015 and April 3, 2024. The complaint named the plan sponsor as well as the committees overseeing the plan and their respective members as defendants, and alleged breach of fiduciary duty and violations of other duties owed to retirement plan participants under ERISA. We resolved this matter at a cost that was within our established accruals for loss contingencies.\nEdmar Financial Company, LLC et al v. Currenex, Inc. et al\nIn August 2021, \ntwo\n former Currenex clients filed a putative civil class action lawsuit in the Southern District of New York alleging antitrust violations, fraud and a civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act violation against Currenex, State Street and others.\nPension Risk Transfer Litigation\nState Street Global Advisors Trust Company (“SSGA”) is named as a defendant in a series of purported class action complaints filed by participants in pension plans where, in each case, SSGA was hired as independent fiduciary on behalf of the pension plan to conduct an ERISA-compliant due diligence review of potential insurers who could assume the plan’s liabilities and satisfy its payment obligations through the purchase of a group annuity contract, consistent with DOL guidance. The complaints, collectively, allege violations of ERISA’s fiduciary and prohibited transaction rules against SSGA, the plan sponsors, and others.\nGerman Tax Matter\nIn connection with a routine audit including the period 2013-2015, German tax authorities have questioned whether State Street should have \nwithheld and be secondarily liable for certain taxes on dividends paid on securities of German issuers held as collateral over dividend record dates in client lending transactions with counterparties outside of Germany.\nOFAC Matter\nIn June 2024, State Street entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s OFAC to resolve its investigation into apparent violations of OFAC’s Ukraine-/Russia-Related Sanctions Regulations. In connection with the settlement, we paid a civil monetary penalty of $\n7.45\n million and made certain compliance commitments.\nState of Texas et al v. Blackrock, Inc. et al\nIn November 2024, \neleven\n state Attorneys General filed a complaint in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Texas against State Street, BlackRock and Vanguard, alleging antitrust violations on the theory that the \nthree\n companies conspired to artificially suppress coal supply, resulting in harm to American consumers in the form of higher electricity costs. \nIncome Taxes\nIn determining our provision for income taxes, we make certain judgments and interpretations with respect to tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have business operations. Because of the complex nature of these laws, in the normal course of our business, we are subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. income tax authorities regarding the amount of income taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of taxable income among tax jurisdictions. We recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not that our position will result in a tax deduction or credit. Unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $\n237\n million as of both December 31, 2024  and December 31, 2023. \nWe are presently under audit by a number of tax authorities. The earliest tax year open to examination in jurisdictions where we have material operations is 2017. Management believes that we have sufficiently accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2024 for potential tax exposures.\nNote 14.    \nVariable Interest Entities\nWe are involved, in the normal course of our business, with various types of special purpose entities, some of which meet the definition of VIEs. When evaluating a VIE for consolidation, we must determine whether or not we have a variable interest in the entity. Variable interests are investments or other interests that absorb portions of an entity’s expected losses or receive portions of the entity’s expected returns. If it is determined that we do not \n State Street Corporation | 159\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nhave a variable interest in the VIE, no further analysis is required and we do not consolidate the VIE. If we hold a variable interest in a VIE, we are required by U.S. GAAP to consolidate that VIE when we have a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. We are determined to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE when we have both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE. This determination is evaluated periodically as facts and circumstances change.\nAsset-Backed Investment Securities\nWe invest in various forms of ABS, which we carry in our investment securities portfolio. These ABS meet the U.S. GAAP definition of asset securitization entities, which are considered to be VIEs. We are not considered to be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since we do not have control over their activities. Additional information about our ABS is provided in Note 3.\nInterests in Investment Funds\nIn the normal course of business, we manage various types of investment funds through State Street Global Advisors in which\n \nour clients are investors, including State Street Global Advisors commingled investment vehicles and other similar investment structures. The majority of our AUM are contained within such funds. The services we provide to these funds generate management fee revenue. From time to time, we may invest cash in the funds in order for the funds to establish a performance history for newly-launched strategies, referred to as seed capital, or for other purposes. \nWith respect to our interests in funds that meet the definition of a VIE, a primary beneficiary assessment is performed to determine if we have a controlling financial interest. As part of our assessment, we consider all the facts and circumstances regarding the terms and characteristics of the variable interest(s), the design and characteristics of the fund and the other involvements of the enterprise with the fund. If consolidation of certain funds is required, we retain the specialized investment company accounting rules followed by the underlying funds. When we no longer control these funds due to a reduced ownership interest or other reasons, the funds are de-consolidated and accounted for under another accounting method if we continue to maintain investments in the funds.\n \nAs of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we ha\nd \nno\n co\nnsolidated funds. As of December 31, 2024 \nand 2023, we managed certain funds, considered VIEs, in which we held a variable interest but for which we were not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Our potential maximum loss exposure related to these unconsolidated funds totaled \n$\n19\n million\n and $\n18\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and represented the carrying value of our investments, which are recorded in other assets in our consolidated statement of condition. The amount of loss we may recognize during any period is limited to the carrying amount of our investments in the unconsolidated funds.\nOur conclusion to consolidate a fund may vary from period to period, most commonly as a result of fluctuation in our ownership interest as a result of changes in the number of fund shares held by either us or by third parties. Given that the funds follow specialized investment company accounting rules which prescribe fair value, a de-consolidation generally would not result in gains or losses for us. \nThe net assets of any consolidated fund are solely available to settle the liabilities of the fund and to settle any investors’ ownership redemption requests, including any seed capital invested in the fund by us. We are not contractually required to provide financial or any other support to any of our funds. In addition, neither creditors nor equity investors in the funds have any recourse to our general credit.\nWe also held investments in low-income housing, production and investment tax credit entities, considered VIEs for which we were not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our potential maximum loss exposure related to these unconsolidated entities totaled \n$\n1.10\n billion\n and $\n1.33\n billion, respectively, most of which represented the carrying value of our investments, which are recorded in other assets in our consolidated statement of condition.\nWe account for our low-income housing tax credit investments (LIHTC) and production tax credit investments under the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the initial cost of the investment is amortized based on a percentage of the actual income tax credits and other income tax benefits allocated in the current period versus the total estimated income tax credits and other income tax benefits expected to be received over the life of the investment. The net benefit, representing the difference between amortization of the investment balance, recognition of the income tax credits and recognition of other income tax benefits from the investment is recognized as a component of income tax expense.\n State Street Corporation | 160\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had investments in LIHTC and production tax credit investments of \n$\n705\n million \nand \n$\n291\n million\n, respectively, which are included in other assets in our consolidated statement of condition. Contingent contributions related to the renewable energy production tax credit investments were \n$\n42\n million\n at December 31, 2024. These contributions are contingent on production and expected to be paid through 2034. Deferred contributions related to LIHTC investments were \n$\n110\n million\n at December 31, 2024. These deferred contributions are payable in accordance with the respective agreements and are expected to be paid through\n 2042. \nThe following table presents the impact of our tax credit programs for which we have elected to apply proportional amortization accounting on our consolidated statement of income for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31, \n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nIncome (loss) recorded on investments within other fee revenue\n$\n29\n \n$\n26\n \nIncome recorded in total revenue\n29\n \n26\n \nTax credits and benefits recognized in income tax expense\n256\n \n239\n \nProportional amortization recognized in income tax expense\n(\n207\n)\n(\n182\n)\nNet benefits included in income tax expense\n49\n \n57\n \nNet benefit attributable to tax-advantaged investments included in the consolidated statement of income for which proportional amortization has been elected\n$\n78\n \n$\n83\n \nNote 15.    \nShareholders’ Equity\nPreferred Stock \nThe following table summarizes selected terms of each of the series of the preferred stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2024:\nPreferred Stock\n(1)\n:\nIssuance Date\nDepositary Shares Issued\nOwnership Interest Per Depositary Share\nLiquidation Preference Per Share\nLiquidation Preference Per Depositary Share\nPer Annum Dividend Rate\nDividend Payment Frequency\nCarrying Value as of December 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nRedemption Date\n(2)\nSeries G\nApril 2016\n20,000,000\n1/4,000th\n100,000\n \n25\n \n5.35\n%\n(3)\nQuarterly\n$\n493\n \nMarch 15, 2026\nSeries I\nJanuary 2024\n1,500,000\n \n1/100th\n100,000\n \n1,000\n \n6.700\n% through March 14, 2029; resets March 15, 2029 and every subsequent \nfive\n  year anniversary at the five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus \n2.613\n%\nQuarterly\n1,481\n \nMarch 15, 2029\nSeries J\nJuly 2024\n850,000\n \n1/100th\n100,000\n \n1,000\n \n6.700\n% through September 14, 2029; resets September 15, 2029 and every subsequent \nfive\n  year anniversary at the five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus \n2.628\n%\nQuarterly\n842\n \nSeptember 15, 2029\n(1) \nThe preferred stock and corresponding depositary shares may be redeemed at our option in whole, but not in part, prior to the redemption date upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event, as defined in the certificate of designation, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share and liquidation price per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.\n(2) \nOn the redemption date, or any dividend payment date thereafter, the preferred stock and corresponding depositary shares may be redeemed by us, in whole or in part, at the liquidation price per share and liquidation price per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.\n(3)\n The dividend rate for the floating rate period of the Series G preferred stock that begins on March 15, 2026 and all subsequent floating rate periods will remain at the current fixed rate in accordance with the LIBOR Act and the contractual terms of the Series G preferred stock.\n \nOn January 31, 2024, we issued \n1.5\n million depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of fixed rate reset, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series I, without par value per share, with a liquidation preference of $\n100,000\n per share (equivalent to $\n1,000\n per depositary share), in a public offering.

Failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial condition. Under current regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specified capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of our consolidated assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures calculated in conformity with regulatory accounting practices. Our capital components and their classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act, we and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a “capital floor” in the calculation and assessment of regulatory capital adequacy by the U.S. Agencies. Beginning on January 1, 2015, we were required to calculate our risk-based capital ratios using both the advanced approaches and the standardized approach. As a result, from January 1, 2015 going forward, our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.\n State Street Corporation | 163\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2024, we and State Street Bank exceeded all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject. As of December 31, 2024, State Street Bank was categorized as “well capitalized” under the applicable regulatory capital adequacy framework, and exceeded all “well capitalized” ratio guidelines to which it was subject. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since December 31, 2024 that have changed the capital categorization of State Street Bank.\nThe following table presents the regulatory capital structure, total RWA, related regulatory capital ratios and the minimum required regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated.\nState Street Corporation\nState Street Bank\n(Dollars in millions)\nBasel III Advanced Approaches December 31, 2024\nBasel III Standardized Approach December 31, 2024\nBasel III Advanced Approaches December 31, 2023\nBasel III Standardized Approach December 31, 2023\nBasel III Advanced Approaches December 31, 2024\nBasel III Standardized Approach December 31, 2024\nBasel III Advanced Approaches December 31, 2023\nBasel III Standardized Approach December 31, 2023\n Common shareholders’ equity:\nCommon stock and related surplus\n$\n11,226\n \n$\n11,226\n \n$\n11,245\n \n$\n11,245\n \n$\n13,333\n \n$\n13,333\n \n$\n13,033\n \n$\n13,033\n \nRetained earnings\n29,582\n \n29,582\n \n27,957\n \n27,957\n \n15,977\n \n15,977\n \n14,454\n \n14,454\n \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n2,100\n)\n(\n2,100\n)\n(\n2,354\n)\n(\n2,354\n)\n(\n1,805\n)\n(\n1,805\n)\n(\n2,097\n)\n(\n2,097\n)\nTreasury stock, at cost\n(\n16,198\n)\n(\n16,198\n)\n(\n15,025\n)\n(\n15,025\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n22,510\n \n22,510\n \n21,823\n \n21,823\n \n27,505\n \n27,505\n \n25,390\n \n25,390\n \nRegulatory capital adjustments:\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities\n(\n8,320\n)\n(\n8,320\n)\n(\n8,470\n)\n(\n8,470\n)\n(\n8,054\n)\n(\n8,054\n)\n(\n8,208\n)\n(\n8,208\n)\nOther adjustments\n(1)\n(\n391\n)\n(\n391\n)\n(\n382\n)\n(\n382\n)\n(\n278\n)\n(\n278\n)\n(\n298\n)\n(\n298\n)\n Common equity tier 1 capital\n13,799\n \n13,799\n \n12,971\n \n12,971\n \n19,173\n \n19,173\n \n16,884\n \n16,884\n \nPreferred stock\n2,816\n \n2,816\n \n1,976\n \n1,976\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n Tier 1 capital\n16,615\n \n16,615\n \n14,947\n \n14,947\n \n19,173\n \n19,173\n \n16,884\n \n16,884\n \nQualifying subordinated long-term debt\n1,861\n \n1,861\n \n1,870\n \n1,870\n \n530\n \n530\n \n536\n \n536\n \nAdjusted allowance for credit losses\n—\n \n183\n \n—\n \n150\n \n—\n \n183\n \n—\n \n150\n \n Total capital\n$\n18,476\n \n$\n18,659\n \n$\n16,817\n \n$\n16,967\n \n$\n19,703\n \n$\n19,886\n \n$\n17,420\n \n$\n17,570\n \n Risk-weighted assets:\nCredit risk\n(2)\n$\n63,252\n \n$\n124,281\n \n$\n61,210\n \n$\n109,228\n \n$\n57,883\n \n$\n121,785\n \n$\n54,942\n \n$\n107,067\n \nOperational risk\n(3)\n49,350\n \n NA\n43,768\n \nNA\n47,538\n \nNA\n42,297\n \nNA\nMarket risk\n2,000\n \n2,000\n \n2,475\n \n2,475\n \n2,000\n \n2,000\n \n2,475\n \n2,475\n \nTotal risk-weighted assets\n$\n114,602\n \n$\n126,281\n \n$\n107,453\n \n$\n111,703\n \n$\n107,421\n \n$\n123,785\n \n$\n99,714\n \n$\n109,542\n \nAdjusted quarterly average assets\n$\n318,470\n \n$\n318,470\n \n$\n269,807\n \n$\n269,807\n \n$\n314,754\n \n$\n314,754\n \n$\n266,818\n \n$\n266,818\n \nCapital Ratios:\n2024 Minimum Requirements\n(4)\n2023 Minimum Requirements\n(4)\nCommon equity tier 1 capital\n8.0\n \n%\n8.0\n \n%\n12.0\n \n%\n10.9\n \n%\n12.1\n \n%\n11.6\n \n%\n17.8\n \n%\n15.5\n \n%\n16.9\n \n%\n15.4\n \n%\nTier 1 capital\n9.5\n \n9.5\n \n14.5\n \n13.2\n \n13.9\n \n13.4\n \n17.8\n \n15.5\n \n16.9\n \n15.4\n \nTotal capital\n11.5\n \n11.5\n \n16.1\n \n14.8\n \n15.7\n \n15.2\n \n18.3\n \n16.1\n \n17.5\n \n16.0\n \nTier 1 leverage\n(5)\n4.0\n \n4.0\n \n5.2\n \n5.2\n \n5.5\n \n5.5\n \n6.1\n \n6.1\n \n6.3\n \n6.3\n \n(1)\n Other adjustments within CET1 capital primarily include disallowed deferred tax assets, cash flow hedges that are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, and the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities. \n(2) \nUnder the advanced approaches, credit risk RWA includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of OTC derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches.\n(3) \nUnder the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.\n(4) \nMinimum requirements include a CCB of \n2.5\n% and a SCB of \n2.5\n% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of \n1.0\n% and a countercyclical buffer of \n0\n%. On June 26, 2024, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2024 supervisory stress test.

Compensation expense related to equity-based awards with performance conditions and terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award, and is based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions at each reporting date. Compensation expense is adjusted for assumptions with respect to the estimated amount of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting, and for employees who have met certain retirement eligibility criteria. Compensation expense for common stock awards granted to employees meeting early retirement eligibility criteria is fully expensed on the grant date. \nDividend equivalents for certain equity-based awards are paid on stock units on a current basis prior to vesting and distribution.\nThe 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, or 2017 Plan, was amended and restated and approved by shareholders in May 2023 for issuance of stock and stock based awards. Awards may be made under the 2017 Plan for (i) up to \n15.1\n million shares of common stock plus (ii) up to an additional \n28.5\n million shares that were available to be issued under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2006 Plan, or may become available for issuance under the 2006 Plan due to expiration, termination, cancellation, forfeiture or repurchase of awards granted under the 2006 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, a total of \n20.8\n million shares from the 2006 Plan have been added to and may be issued from the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, a cumulative total of \n24.7\n million shares have been awarded under the 2017 Plan, compared to cumulative totals of \n21.7\n million shares and \n18.7\n million shares as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n The 2017 Plan allows for shares withheld in payment of the exercise price of an award or in satisfaction of tax withholding requirements, shares forfeited due to employee termination, shares expired under option awards, or shares not delivered when performance conditions have not been met, to be added back to the pool of shares available for issuance under the 2017 Plan. From inception to December 31, 2024, \n7.0\n million shares had been awarded under the 2017 Plan but not delivered, and have become available for re-issue. As of December 31, 2024, a total of \n18.3\n million shares were available for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.\nFor deferred stock awards granted under the Plans, no common stock is issued at the time of grant and the award does not possess dividend and voting rights. Generally, these grants vest over \nzero\n to \nfour years\n. Performance awards granted are earned over a performance period based on the achievement of defined goals, generally over \nthree years\n. Payment for performance awards is made in shares of our common stock equal to its fair market value per share, based on the performance of certain financial ratios, after the conclusion of each performance period.\nBeginning with 2012, malus-based forfeiture provisions were included in deferred stock awards granted to employees identified as “material risk-takers,” as defined by management. These malus-based forfeiture provisions provide for the reduction or cancellation of unvested deferred compensation, such as deferred stock awards and performance-based awards, if it is determined that a material risk-\n State Street Corporation | 165\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ntaker made risk-based decisions that exposed us to inappropriate risks that resulted in a material unexpected loss at the business-unit, line-of-business or corporate level. In addition, awards granted to certain of our senior executives, as well as awards granted to individuals in certain jurisdictions, may be subject to recoupment after vesting (if applicable) and delivery to the individual in specified circumstances generally relating to fraud or willful misconduct by the individual that results in material harm to us or a material financial restatement.\nCompensation expense related to deferred stock awards and performance awards, which we record as a component of compensation and employee benefits expense in our consolidated statement of income, was $\n223\n million, $\n208\n million and $\n240\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Such expense for 2024, 2023 and 2022 excluded an expense of $\n3\n million, $\n12\n million and $\n21\n million, respectively, associated with acceleration of expense in connection with targeted staff reductions.

We do not have a specific policy concerning purchases of our common stock to satisfy stock issuances. We have a general policy concerning purchases of our common stock to meet issuances under our employee benefit plans, including other corporate purposes. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our purchases of our common stock, including regulatory reviews and approvals or non-objections, our regulatory capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue under employee benefit plans, market conditions (including the trading \n State Street Corporation | 166\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nprice of our common stock), and legal considerations. These factors can change at any time, and the number of shares of common stock we will purchase or when we will purchase them cannot be assured. Additional information on our common stock purchase program is provided in Note 15.\nNote 19.    \nEmployee Benefits\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nState Street Bank and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries participate in a non-contributory, tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. The U.S. defined benefit pension plan was frozen as of December 31, 2007 and \nno\n new employees were eligible to participate after that date. We have agreed to contribute sufficient amounts as necessary to meet the benefits paid to plan participants and to fund the plan’s service cost, plus interest. U.S. employee account balances earn annual interest credits until the employee begins receiving benefits. Non-U.S. employees participate in local defined benefit plans which are funded as required in each local jurisdiction. In addition to the defined benefit pension plans, we have non-qualified unfunded SERPs that provide certain officers with defined pension benefits in excess of allowable qualified plan limits. State Street Bank and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries also participate in a post-retirement plan that provides health care benefits for certain retired employees. The total expense for these tax-qualified and non-qualified plans was $\n17\n million, $\n16\n million and $\n21\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, in the consolidated statement of position. The assets held by the defined benefit pension plans are largely made up of common, collective funds that are liquid and invest principally in U.S. equities and high-quality fixed-income investments. The majority of these assets fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The benefit obligations associated with our primary U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans, non-qualified unfunded supplemental retirement plans and post-retirement plans were $\n1.10\n billion, $\n19\n million and less than $\n1\n million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and $\n1.16\n billion, $\n25\n million and $\n1\n million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. As the primary defined benefit plans are frozen, the benefit obligation will only vary over time as a result of changes in market interest rates, the life expectancy of the plan participants and payments made from the plans. The primary U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were overfunded by $\n26\n million and $\n10\n million \nas of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The non-qualified supplemental retirement plans were underfunded by $\n19\n million and $\n25\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The other post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by less than $\n1\n million and $\n1\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The underfunded status is included in other liabilities.\nDefined Contribution Retirement Plans\nWe contribute to employer-sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans. Our contribution to these plans was $\n212\n million, $\n194\n million and $\n171\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNote 20.    \nOccupancy Expense and Information Systems and Communications Expense\nOccupancy expense and information systems and communications expense include depreciation of buildings, leasehold improvements, computer hardware and software, equipment, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of lease right-of-use assets. Total depreciation and amortization expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n824\n million, $\n829\n million and $\n842\n million, respectively.\nWe use our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments for finance and operating leases described below. Additionally, we do not separate nonlease components such as real estate taxes and common area maintenance from base lease payments.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had finance leases for information technology equipment of $\n67\n million and $\n119\n million, respectively, recorded in premises and equipment, with the related liability of $\n79\n million and $\n130\n million, respectively, recorded in long-term debt, in our consolidated statement of condition. \nFinance lease right-of-use asset amortization is recorded in information systems and communications expense on a straight-line basis in our consolidated statement of income over the respective lease term. Lease payments are recorded as a reduction of the liability, with a portion recorded as imputed interest expense. Accumulated amortization of the finance lease right-of-use assets was $\n135\n million as of December 31, 2024. Interest expense related to the finance lease obligation reflected in NII was $\n3\n million and $\n5\n million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nAs of December 31, 2024, aggregate net book value of the operating lease right-of-use assets recorded in other assets was $\n818\n million, with the related lease liability recorded in \naccrued expenses and other liabilities\n in our consolidated statement of condition.\nWe have entered into non-cancellable operating leases for premises and equipment. Nearly all of \n State Street Corporation | 167\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthese leases include renewal options, and only those reasonably certain of being exercised are included in the term of the lease. Costs for operating leases are recorded on a straight-line basis which includes both interest expense and right-of-use asset amortization. Operating lease costs for office space are recorded in occupancy expense. Costs related to operating leases for equipment are recorded in information systems and communications expense.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for office space and equipment, that have not yet commenced with approximately $\n207\n million of undiscounted future minimum lease payments. These leases will commence in fiscal year 2025 with lease terms ranging from \n3\n to \n11\n years.\nNone of our leases contain residual value guarantees.\nThe following table presents lease costs, sublease rental income, cash flows and new leases arising from lease transactions for 2024:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nFinance lease:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets\n$\n48\n \n$\n48\n \nInterest on lease liabilities\n3\n \n5\n \nTotal finance lease expense\n51\n \n53\n \nSublease income \n—\n \n—\n \nNet finance lease expense\n51\n \n53\n \nOperating lease:\nOperating lease expense\n168\n \n163\n \nSublease income\n \n(\n17\n)\n(\n23\n)\nNet operating lease expense\n151\n \n140\n \nNet lease expense\n$\n202\n \n$\n193\n \nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from finance leases\n$\n3\n \n$\n5\n \nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n179\n \n197\n \nFinancing cash flows from finance leases\n46\n \n45\n \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease obligations:\nOperating leases\n$\n174\n \n$\n461\n \nFinance leases\n—\n \n—\n \nThe following table presents future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases as of December 31, 2024:\n(In millions)\nOperating Leases\nFinance Leases\nTotal\n2025\n$\n182\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n237\n \n2026\n152\n \n26\n \n178\n \n2027\n134\n \n—\n \n134\n \n2028\n118\n \n—\n \n118\n \n2029\n88\n \n—\n \n88\n \nThereafter\n342\n \n—\n \n342\n \nTotal future minimum lease payments\n1,016\n \n81\n \n1,097\n \nLess imputed interest\n(\n177\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n179\n)\n     Total\n$\n839\n \n$\n79\n \n$\n918\n \nThe following table presents details related to remaining lease terms and discount rate as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years):\n     Finance leases\n1.4\n2.5\n     Operating leases\n8.1\n8.5\nWeighted-average discount rate:\n     Finance leases\n3\n \n%\n3\n \n%\n     Operating leases\n4\n \n%\n4\n \n%\nNote 21.    \nExpenses\nThe following table presents the components of other expenses for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nProfessional services\n$\n465\n \n$\n428\n \n$\n375\n \nRegulatory fees and assessments\n(1)\n142\n \n464\n \n83\n \nSales advertising and public relations\n142\n \n142\n \n99\n \nSecurities processing\n78\n \n49\n \n63\n \nBank operations\n51\n \n45\n \n41\n \nDonations\n28\n \n27\n \n27\n \nOther\n433\n \n374\n \n387\n \nTotal other expenses\n$\n1,339\n \n$\n1,529\n \n$\n1,075\n \n(1)\n \nIncludes an FDIC special assessment of $\n99\n million and $\n387\n million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to FDIC’s recovery of estimated losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank reflected in other expenses\n.\nRepositioning Charges\nIn 2024, we recorded a net repositioning release of $\n2\n million, including a $\n15\n million release reflected in compensation and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by $\n13\n million of occupancy charges related to footprint optimization.\n State Street Corporation | 168\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn 2023, we recorded net repositioning charges of approximately $\n203\n million to enable the next phase of our productivity efforts to streamline operations and technology, and improve efficiency.

Our objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year through charges or credits to the current tax provision, and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of temporary differences between amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases. The measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates. The effects of a tax position on our consolidated financial statements are recognized when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained. A valuation allowance is established if it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in our consolidated statement of condition are netted within the same tax jurisdiction.\nThe following table presents the components of income tax expense (benefit) for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n108\n \n$\n160\n \n$\n161\n \nState\n68\n \n79\n \n112\n \nNon-U.S.\n387\n \n317\n \n342\n \nTotal current expense\n563\n \n556\n \n615\n \nDeferred:\nFederal\n77\n \n(\n77\n)\n(\n16\n)\nState\n2\n \n(\n63\n)\n(\n2\n)\nNon-U.S.\n66\n \n(\n44\n)\n(\n44\n)\nTotal deferred expense (benefit)\n145\n \n(\n184\n)\n(\n62\n)\nTotal income tax expense (benefit)\n$\n708\n \n$\n372\n \n$\n553\n \n \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate based on income before income tax expense for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nU.S. federal income tax rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nChanges from statutory rate:\nState taxes, net of federal benefit\n1.8\n \n2.4\n \n3.1\n \nTax-exempt income\n(\n1.0\n)\n(\n1.5\n)\n(\n1.0\n)\nBusiness tax credits\n(1)\n(\n2.0\n)\n(\n3.6\n)\n(\n4.0\n)\nForeign tax differential\n1.0\n \n(\n0.6\n)\n—\n \nForeign tax credit (benefits)/ limitations\n(2)\n0.6\n \n(\n2.0\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\nChange in Valuation Allowance\n(\n0.5\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\n(\n2.0\n)\nOther, net\n(\n0.1\n)\n0.6\n \n(\n0.4\n)\nEffective tax rate\n20.8\n \n%\n16.1\n \n%\n16.6\n \n%\n(1)\n Business tax credits include research, low-income housing, production and investment tax credits.\n(2)\n Foreign tax credit (benefits)/limitations includes the period expense for global intangible low-taxed income.\n \n Undistributed indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $\n8.38\n billion at December 31, 2024. As a result, no provision has been recorded for state and local or foreign withholding income taxes. If a distribution were to occur, we would be subject to state, local and to foreign withholding tax. It is expected that any distribution will be exempt from federal income tax. Although the foreign withholding tax is generally creditable against U.S. federal income tax, certain credit utilization limitations may result in a net cost.\n State Street Corporation | 169\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents significant components of our gross deferred tax assets and gross deferred tax liabilities as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nOther amortizable assets\n$\n189\n \n$\n265\n \nTax credit carryforwards\n577\n \n673\n \nLease obligations\n214\n \n236\n \nDeferred compensation\n111\n \n104\n \nRestructuring charges and other reserves\n227\n \n224\n \nNOL and other carryforwards\n147\n \n167\n \nPension plan\n21\n \n24\n \nForeign currency translation\n63\n \n51\n \nUnrealized losses on investment securities, net\n184\n \n352\n \nTotal deferred tax assets \n1,733\n \n2,096\n \nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets\n(\n172\n)\n(\n200\n)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n$\n1,561\n \n$\n1,896\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nFixed and intangible assets\n$\n634\n \n$\n574\n \nInvestment basis differences\n47\n \n40\n \nRight-of-use Assets\n198\n \n214\n \nOther\n40\n \n68\n \nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n$\n919\n \n$\n896\n \nThe table below summarizes the deferred tax assets, carryforwards and related valuation allowances recognized as of December 31, 2024:\n(In millions)\nDeferred Tax Asset\nValuation Allowance\nExpiration\nOther amortizable assets\n$\n189\n \n$\n(\n72\n)\nNone\nTax credits\n577\n \n(\n8\n)\n2042-2044\nNOLs - Non-U.S.\n130\n \n(\n80\n)\n2026-2042, None\nNOLs - U.S.\n14\n \n(\n10\n)\n2025-2043, None\nOther carryforwards\n2\n \n(\n2\n)\nNone\nManagement considers the valuation allowance adequate to reduce the total deferred tax assets to an aggregate amount that will more likely than not be realized. Management has determined that a valuation allowance is not required for the remaining deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable income of the appropriate nature within the carryforward periods to realize these assets.\nAt December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, were $\n237\n million, $\n237\n million and $\n285\n million, respectively. Of this, the amounts that would reduce the effective tax rate, if recognized, are $\n220\n million, $\n197\n million and $\n272\n million, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate includes the federal benefit for unrecognized state tax benefits. \n \nThe following table presents activity related to unrecognized tax benefits as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n237\n \n$\n285\n \n$\n252\n \nDecrease related to agreements with tax authorities\n(\n22\n)\n(\n32\n)\n(\n4\n)\nIncrease related to tax positions taken during current year\n36\n \n39\n \n48\n \nIncrease/(Decrease) related to tax positions taken during prior years\n11\n \n(\n34\n)\n8\n \nDecreases related to a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations\n(\n25\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n19\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n237\n \n$\n237\n \n$\n285\n \nIt is reasonably possible that of the $\n237\n million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, up to $\n37\n million could decrease within the next 12 months due to agreements with tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitations. Management believes that we have sufficient accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2024 for tax exposures and related interest expense.\nIncome tax expense included related interest and penalties of approximately $\n8\n million, $\n7\n million and $\n8\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Diluted EPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method, by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the total weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of equity-based awards. The effect of equity-based awards is excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS in periods in which their effect would be anti-dilutive. \nThe two-class method requires the allocation of undistributed net income between common and participating shareholders. Net income available to common shareholders, presented separately in our consolidated statement of income, is the basis for the calculation of both basic and diluted EPS.

The results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. \nInvestment Servicing\n provides a broad range of services and market and financing solutions to institutional clients, including mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, investment managers, foundations and endowments worldwide.\nThrough State Street Investment Services, State Street Global Markets\n®\n and State Street Alpha\n®\n, we offer a full range of back- and middle-office solutions, \nincluding custody, accounting and fund administration services for traditional and alternative assets, as well as multi-asset class investments; recordkeeping, client reporting and investment book of record, transaction management, loans, cash, derivatives and collateral services; investor services operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; financial data management to support institutional investors; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance, including prime services products; and deposit and short-term investment facilities.\nTogether with our middle- and back-office services, CRD’s front- and middle-office technology offerings form the foundation of State Street Alpha\n®\n. Our State Street Alpha platform combines portfolio management, trading and execution, analytics and compliance tools, and advanced data aggregation and integration with other industry platforms and providers.

In general, our clients will use a combination of services, depending on their needs, rather than one product or service. For instance, a custody client may purchase securities finance and cash management services from different business units. Products and services that we provide to our clients are parts of an integrated offering to these clients. We price our products and services on the basis of overall client relationships and other factors; as a result, revenue may not necessarily reflect the stand-alone market price of these products and services within the business lines in the same way it would for separate business entities.\nOur servicing and management fee revenue from the Investment Servicing and Investment Management business lines, including foreign exchange trading services and securities finance activities, represents approximately \n70\n% of our consolidated total revenue. The remaining \n30\n% is composed of software and processing fees, including front office software and data and lending related and other fees, as well as NII, which is largely generated by our investment of client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt in a variety of assets, and net gains (losses) related to investment securities. These other revenue types are generally fully allocated to, or reside in, Investment Servicing and Investment Management.\nRevenue and expenses are directly charged or allocated to our lines of business through management information systems. Our CODM is the chief executive officer. The line of business results are regularly provided to the CODM to evaluate the performance of each line of business and to inform how resources are allocated between those lines of business to best achieve management’s strategic and tactical goals. Capital is allocated based on the relative risks and capital requirements inherent in each business line, along with management judgment. Capital allocations may not be representative of the capital that might be required if these lines of business were separate business entities.  \nThe following is a summary of our line of business results for the periods indicated. \nYears Ended December 31,\nInvestment\nServicing\nInvestment\nManagement\nOther\nTotal\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenue:\nServicing fees\n$\n5,016\n \n$\n4,922\n \n$\n5,087\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5,016\n \n$\n4,922\n \n$\n5,087\n \nManagement fees\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,124\n \n1,876\n \n1,939\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,124\n \n1,876\n \n1,939\n \nForeign exchange trading services\n1,248\n \n1,140\n \n1,271\n \n138\n \n125\n \n82\n \n15\n \n—\n \n23\n \n1,401\n \n1,265\n \n1,376\n \nSecurities finance\n415\n \n402\n \n397\n \n23\n \n24\n \n19\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n438\n \n426\n \n416\n \nSoftware and processing fees\n888\n \n811\n \n789\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n888\n \n811\n \n789\n \nOther fee revenue\n(1)\n188\n \n145\n \n46\n \n35\n \n35\n \n(\n47\n)\n66\n \n—\n \n—\n \n289\n \n180\n \n(\n1\n)\nTotal fee revenue\n7,755\n \n7,420\n \n7,590\n \n2,320\n \n2,060\n \n1,993\n \n81\n \n—\n \n23\n \n10,156\n \n9,480\n \n9,606\n \nNet interest income\n2,899\n \n2,740\n \n2,551\n \n24\n \n19\n \n(\n7\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,923\n \n2,759\n \n2,544\n \nTotal other income\n2\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n81\n)\n(\n294\n)\n—\n \n(\n79\n)\n(\n294\n)\n(\n2\n)\nTotal revenue\n10,656\n \n10,160\n \n10,139\n \n2,344\n \n2,079\n \n1,986\n \n—\n \n(\n294\n)\n23\n \n13,000\n \n11,945\n \n12,148\n \nProvision for credit losses\n75\n \n46\n \n20\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n75\n \n46\n \n20\n \nExpenses:\nCompensation and employee benefits\n4,078\n \n4,033\n \n3,896\n \n555\n \n520\n \n478\n \n64\n \n191\n \n54\n \n4,697\n \n4,744\n \n4,428\n \nInformation systems and communications\n1,743\n \n1,568\n \n1,535\n \n86\n \n94\n \n95\n \n—\n \n41\n \n—\n \n1,829\n \n1,703\n \n1,630\n \nTransaction processing services\n825\n \n777\n \n809\n \n173\n \n180\n \n162\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n998\n \n957\n \n971\n \nOther\n1,041\n \n1,035\n \n1,020\n \n841\n \n746\n \n661\n \n124\n \n398\n \n91\n \n2,006\n \n2,179\n \n1,772\n \nTotal expenses\n7,687\n \n7,413\n \n7,260\n \n1,655\n \n1,540\n \n1,396\n \n188\n \n630\n \n145\n \n9,530\n \n9,583\n \n8,801\n \nIncome before income tax expense\n$\n2,894\n \n$\n2,701\n \n$\n2,859\n \n$\n689\n \n$\n539\n \n$\n590\n \n$\n(\n188\n)\n$\n(\n924\n)\n$\n(\n122\n)\n$\n3,395\n \n$\n2,316\n \n$\n3,327\n \nPre-tax margin\n27\n \n%\n27\n \n%\n28\n \n%\n29\n \n%\n26\n \n%\n30\n \n%\n26\n \n%\n19\n \n%\n27\n \n%\nAverage assets (in billions)\n$\n308.5\n \n$\n271.5\n \n$\n283.2\n \n$\n3.2\n \n$\n3.2\n \n$\n3.2\n \n$\n311.7\n \n$\n274.7\n \n$\n286.4\n \n (1) \nInvestment Management includes other revenue items that are primarily driven by equity market movements.\n State Street Corporation | 172\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe “Other” columns presented in the previous table, represent amounts that are not allocated to our \ntwo\n lines of business. \nThe following provides additional information about the items included in the line of business results “Other” column for the periods indicated. \nYears Ended December 31,\nOther\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFee revenue\n(1)\n$\n81\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n23\n \nOther Income\n(2)\n(\n81\n)\n(\n294\n)\n—\n \nDeferred incentive compensation expense acceleration\n(3)\n(\n79\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nNet repositioning charges\n(4)\n2\n \n(\n203\n)\n(\n70\n)\nNet acquisition and restructuring costs\n(5)\n—\n \n15\n \n(\n65\n)\nFDIC special assessment and other\n(6)\n(\n111\n)\n(\n442\n)\n(\n10\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n188\n)\n$\n(\n924\n)\n$\n(\n122\n)\n \n(1) \nIncludes a $\n66\n million gain on sale of equity investment and a $\n15\n million revenue-related recovery associated with the proceeds from a 2018 foreign exchange benchmark litigation resolution, which is reflected in foreign exchange trading services revenue.\n(2)\n Includes the loss on the sale of investment securities of $\n81\n million and $\n294\n million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the repositioning of the investment portfolio.\n(3) \nDeferred compensation expense acceleration of $\n79\n million in 2024 reflected in compensation and employee benefits, associated with an amendment of certain outstanding deferred cash incentive compensation awards to align our deferred pay mix with peers.\n(4)\n Net repositioning charges in 2024 includes a $\n15\n million release reflected in compensation and employee benefits, partially offset by $\n13\n million of occupancy charges related to footprint optimization.

The amount of revenue that we recognize is measured based on the consideration specified in contracts with our customers, and excludes taxes collected from customers subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. We recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied over time as the services are performed or at a point in time depending on the nature of the services provided as further discussed below. Revenue recognition guidance related to contracts with customers excludes our NII, revenue earned on security lending transactions entered into as principal, realized gains/losses on securities, revenue earned on foreign exchange activity, loans and related fees, and gains/losses on hedging and derivatives, to which we apply other applicable U.S. GAAP guidance.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, or contracts that have been combined, we allocate the contracts’ transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price. Our contractual fees are negotiated on a customer by customer basis and are representative of standalone selling price utilized for allocating revenue when there are multiple performance obligations.\nSubstantially all of our services are provided as a distinct series of daily performance obligations that the customer simultaneously benefits from as they are performed. Payments may be made to third party service providers and the expense is recognized gross when we control those services as we are deemed the principal.\nContract durations may vary from short- to long-term or may be open ended. Termination notice periods are in line with general market practice and typically do not include termination penalties. Therefore, for substantially all of our revenues, the duration of the contract and the enforceable rights and obligations do not extend beyond the services that are performed daily or at the transaction level. In instances where we have substantive termination penalties, the duration of the contract may extend through the date of substantive termination penalties.\nInvestment Servicing\nRevenue from contracts with customers related to servicing fees is recognized over time as our customers benefit from the custody, administration, accounting, transfer agency and other related asset services as they are performed. At contract inception, no revenue is estimated as the fees are dependent on assets under custody and/or administration and/or actual transactions which are susceptible to market factors outside of our control. Therefore, revenue is recognized using a time-based output method as the customers benefit from the services over time and as the assets under custody or transactions are known or determinable during each reporting period based on contractual fee schedules. Payments made to third party service providers, such as sub-custodians, are generally recognized gross as we control those services and are deemed to be a principal in such arrangements.\nForeign exchange trading services revenue includes revenue generated from providing access and use of electronic trading platforms and other trading, transition management and brokerage services. Electronic FX \n State Street Corporation | 173\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nservices are dependent on the volume of actual transactions initiated through our electronic exchange platforms. Revenue is recognized over time using a time-based measure as access to, and use of, the electronic exchange platforms is made available to the customer and the activity is determinable. Revenue related to other trading, transition management and brokerage services is recognized when the customer obtains the benefit of such services which may be over time or at a point in time upon trade execution.\nSecurities finance revenue is related to services for providing agency lending programs to State Street Global Advisors managed investment funds and third-party investment managers and asset owners. This securities finance revenue is recognized over time using a time-based measure as our customers benefit from these lending services.\nRevenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD is primarily driven by the sale of licenses and SaaS arrangements, including professional services such as consulting and implementation services, software support and maintenance. Revenue for a sale of software to be installed on premise is recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license. Revenue for a SaaS related arrangement is recognized over time as services are provided.\nInvestment Management\nRevenue from contracts with customers related to investment management, investment research and investment advisory services provided through State Street Global Advisors is recognized over time as our customers benefit from the services as they are performed. Substantially all of our investment management fees are determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategies employed. At contract inception, no revenue is estimated as the fees are dependent on assets under management which are susceptible to market factors outside of our control.\nTherefore, substantially all of our Investment Management services revenue is recognized using a time-based output method as the customers benefit from the services over time and as the assets under management are known or determinable during each reporting period based on contractual fee schedules. Payments made to third party service providers, such as payments to others in unitary fee arrangements, are generally recognized on a gross basis when State Street Global Advisors controls those services and is deemed to be a principal in such transactions.\n State Street Corporation | 174\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue by category\nIn the following table, revenue is disaggregated by our \ntwo\n lines of business and by revenue stream for which the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

As performance obligations are satisfied, we have an unconditional right to payment and billing is generally performed monthly or quarterly; therefore, we do not have significant contract assets.\nWe had \n$\n144\n million\n and $\n133\n million of deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Deferred revenue is a contract liability which represents payments received and accounts receivable recorded in advance of providing services and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated statement of condition. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized revenue of \n$\n122\n million\n relating to deferred revenue of $\n133\n million as of December 31, 2023.\nTransaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations represents future, non-cancellable contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, inclusive of deferred revenue that has been invoiced and non-cancellable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. As of December 31, 2024, total remaining non-cancelable performance obligations for services and products not yet delivered, primarily comprised of software license sales and SaaS, were approximately \n$\n1.87\n billion\n. We expect to recognize approximately half of this amount in revenue over the ne\nxt \nthree years\n, wit\nh the remainder to be recognized thereafter.\nNo adjustments are made to the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the period between when we transfer a promised service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service is expected to be one year or less.\nNote 26.    \nNon-U.S. Activities\nWe define our non-U.S. activities as those revenue-producing business activities that arise from clients that are generally serviced or managed outside the U.S. Due to the integrated nature of our business, precise segregation of our U.S. and non-U.S. activities is not possible.\nSubjective estimates, assumptions and other judgments are applied to quantify the financial results and assets related to our non-U.S. activities, including our application of funds transfer pricing, our asset and liability management policies and our allocation of certain indirect corporate expenses. Management periodically reviews and updates its processes for quantifying the financial results and assets related to our non-U.S. activities. \nThe following table presents our U.S. and non-U.S. financial results for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nNon-U.S.\n(1)\nU.S.\nTotal\nNon-U.S.\n(1)\nU.S.\nTotal\nNon-U.S.\n(1)\nU.S.\nTotal\nTotal revenue\n$\n5,485\n \n$\n7,515\n \n$\n13,000\n \n$\n5,108\n \n$\n6,837\n \n$\n11,945\n \n$\n5,170\n \n$\n6,978\n \n$\n12,148\n \nIncome before income tax expense \n1,376\n \n2,019\n \n3,395\n \n1,057\n \n1,259\n \n2,316\n \n1,358\n \n1,969\n \n3,327\n \n(1) \nGeographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.\nNon-U.S. assets were \n$\n88.35\n billion\n and $\n89.85\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n State Street Corporation | 176\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 27.      \nParent Company Financial Statements\nThe following tables present the financial statements of the Parent Company without consolidation of its banking and non-banking subsidiaries, as of and for the years indicated:\nStatement of Income -

This method facilitates the comparison of the performance of these assets. The adjustments are computed using a federal income tax rate of 21% for periods ending in 2024, 2023 and 2022, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit. The fully taxable-equivalent adjustments included in interest income presented above were $3 million, $5 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were substantially related to tax-exempt securities (state and political subdivisions).\n(2)\n Non-U.S. non-interest-bearing deposits were $2.14 billion, $2.81 billion and $2.30 billion as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(3)\n NIM is calculated by dividing fully taxable-equivalent NII by average total interest-earning assets.\n State Street Corporation | 179\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA (CONTINUED)\nThe following table summarizes changes in fully taxable-equivalent interest income and interest expense due to changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and due to changes in interest rates.

To the extent that we provide more than one AUC/A service (including back and middle office services) for a client’s assets, the value of the asset is only counted once in the total amount of AUC/A. \nAssets under management:\n The total market value of client assets for which we provide investment management strategy services, advisory services and/or distribution services generating management fees based on a percentage of the assets’ market values. These client assets are not included on our balance sheet. Assets under management include managed assets lost but not liquidated. Lost business occurs from time to time and it is difficult to predict the timing of client behavior in transitioning these assets as the timing can vary significantly.\nCertificates of deposit:\n A savings certificate with a fixed maturity date, specified fixed interest rate and can be issued in any denomination aside from minimum investment requirements. A CD restricts access to the funds until the maturity date of the investment.\nCollateralized loan obligations:\n A loan or security backed by a pool of debt, primarily senior secured leveraged loans. CLOs are similar to collateralized mortgage obligations, except for the different type of underlying loan. With a CLO, the investor receives scheduled loan or debt payments from the underlying loans, assuming most of the risk in the event borrowers default, but is offered greater diversity and the potential for higher-than-average returns.\nCommercial real estate:\n Property intended to generate profit from capital gains or rental income. CRE loans are term loans secured by commercial and multifamily properties. We seek CRE loans with strong competitive positions in major domestic markets, stable cash flows, modest leverage and experienced institutional ownership.\n \nDeposit beta:\n A measure of how much of an interest rate increase is expected to be passed on to client interest-bearing accounts, on average.\nDoubtful:\n Doubtful loans meet the same definition of substandard loans (i.e., well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize repayment with the possibility that we will sustain some loss) with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable.\nEconomic value of equity:\n A measure designed to estimate the fair value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments based on a discounted cash flow model.\nExchange-Traded Fund: \nA type of exchange-traded investment product that offer investors a way to pool their money in a fund that makes investments in stocks, bonds, or other assets and, in return, to receive an interest in that  investment pool. ETF shares are traded on a national stock exchange and at market prices that may or may not be the same as the net asset value.\nExposure-at-default:\n A measure used in the calculation of regulatory capital under Basel III final rule. It can be defined as the expected amount of loss a bank may be exposed to upon default of an obligor.\nGlobal systemically important bank: \nA financial institution whose distress or disorderly failure, because of its size, complexity and systemic interconnectedness, would cause significant disruption to the wider financial system and economic activity, which will be subject to additional capital requirements.\nHeld-to-maturity investment securities:\n We classify investments in debt securities as held-to-maturity only if we have the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. Investments in debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are measured subsequently at amortized cost in the statement of financial position.\nHigh-quality liquid assets:\n Cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets and are considered unencumbered.\nInvestment grade: \nA rating of loans and leases to counterparties with strong credit quality and low expected credit risk and probability of default. It applies to counterparties with a strong capacity to support the timely repayment of any financial commitment.\nLiquidity coverage ratio:\n The ratio of encumbered high-quality liquid assets divided by expected total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period. A Basel III framework requirement for banks and bank holding companies to measure liquidity, it is designed to ensure that certain banking institutions, including us, maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered HQLA sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day stress period.  \nNet asset value:\n The amount of net assets attributable to each share/unit of the fund at a specific date or time.  \nNet stable funding ratio:\n The ratio of the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding.  This ratio should be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis. \nOn-premises revenue: \nRevenue derived from locally installed software. \n \nPrime services: \nThe securities lending business previously referred to as enhanced custody.\n \nProbability of default:\n A measure of the likelihood that a credit obligor will enter into default status.\n \nQualified financial contracts: \nSecurities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements, swap agreements and any other contract determined by the FDIC to be a qualified financial contract.\nRisk-weighted assets:\n A measurement used to quantify risk inherent in our on and off-balance sheet assets by adjusting the asset value for risk. RWA is used in the calculation of our risk-based capital ratios. \nSoftware-enabled revenue:\n Includes SaaS, maintenance and support revenue, FIX, brokerage, and value-add services.\nSpecial mention:\n Loans that consist of counterparties with potential weaknesses that, if uncorrected, may result in deterioration of repayment prospects.\nSpeculative:\n Loans that consist of counterparties that face ongoing uncertainties or exposure to business, financial, or economic downturns.  However, these counterparties may have financial flexibility or access to financial alternatives, which allow for financial commitments to be met.\nSubstandard:\n Loans that consist of counterparties with well-defined weakness that jeopardizes repayment with the possibility we will sustain some loss. \nSupplementary leverage ratio:\n The ratio of  our tier 1 capital to our total leverage exposure, which measures our capital adequacy relative to our on and off-balance sheet assets.\nTotal loss-absorbing capacity:\n The sum of our tier 1 regulatory capital plus eligible external long-term debt issued by us.\nValue-at-Risk:\n Statistical model used to measure the potential loss in value of a portfolio that could occur in normal markets condition, over a defined holding period, within a certain confidence level. \nVariable interest entity:\n An entity that: (1) lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties; (2) has equity owners that lack the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity’s operations; and/or (3) has equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb or the right to receive the entity’s losses or return.\n State Street Corporation | 182\nITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nState Street has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information related to State Street and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to State Street’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For the year ended December 31, 2024, State Street’s management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of State Street’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that State Street’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024. \nState Street has also established and maintains internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In the ordinary course of business, State Street routinely enhances its internal controls and procedures for financial reporting by either upgrading its current systems or implementing new systems. Changes have been made and may be made to State Street’s internal controls and procedures for financial reporting as a result of these efforts. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, no change occurred in State Street’s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, State Street’s internal control over financial reporting. \n State Street Corporation | 183\nINTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of State Street is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.\nState Street’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. State Street’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of State Street; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of State Street are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of State Street; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of State Street’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  \nManagement assessed the effectiveness of State Street’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, State Street’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.  \nThe effectiveness of State Street’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report, which follows this report.\n State Street Corporation | 184\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of State Street Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited State Street Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, State Street Corporation (the Corporation) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Corporation and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts \nFebruary 13, 2025 \n State Street Corporation | 185\nITEM 9B.  OTHER INFORMATION\nSecurities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers\nA significant portion of the compensation of our executive officers is delivered in the form of deferred equity awards, including deferred stock and performance-based restricted stock unit awards. This compensation design is intended to align executive compensation with the performance experienced by our shareholders. Following the delivery of shares of our common stock under those equity awards, once any applicable service-, time- or performance-based vesting standards have been satisfied, our executive officers from time to time engage in the open-market sale of some of those shares. Our executive officers may also engage from time to time in other transactions involving our securities. \nTransactions in our securities by our executive officers are required to be made in accordance with our Securities Trading Policy, which, among other things, requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables prearranged transactions in securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions at a future date while possibly in possession of material nonpublic information. Our Securities Trading Policy permits our executive officers to enter into trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, none of our executive officers or directors \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K).\nITEM 9C.

Such information is incorporated herein by reference. \nInformation about our executive officers is included under Part I.\nITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nInformation in response to this item will appear in our 2025 Proxy Statement under the captions “Executive Compensation” and “Non-Management Director Compensation.” Such information (other than the information required by Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K) is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nInformation concerning security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management will appear in our 2025 Proxy Statement under the caption “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.” Such information is incorporated herein by reference. \n State Street Corporation | 186\nRELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nThe following table presents the number of outstanding common stock awards, options, warrants and rights granted by State Street to participants in our equity compensation plans, as well as the number of securities available for future issuance under these plans, as of December 31, 2024. The table provides this information separately for equity compensation plans that have and have not been approved by shareholders. Shares presented in the table and in the footnotes following the table are stated in thousands of shares.\n(Shares in thousands)\n(a)\nNumber of securities\nto be issued\nupon exercise of\noutstanding\noptions,\nwarrants and rights\n(b)\nWeighted-average\nexercise price of\noutstanding\noptions,\nwarrants and rights\n(1)\n(c)\nNumber of securities\nremaining available for\nfuture issuance under\nequity compensation\nplans (excluding\nsecurities reflected\nin column (a))\nPlan category:\nEquity compensation plans approved by shareholders\n6,898\n \n(2)\n$\n—\n \n18,255\n \nEquity compensation plans not approved by shareholders\n7\n \n(3)\n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n6,905\n \n—\n \n18,255\n \n(1) \nExcludes deferred stock awards and performance awards for which there is no exercise price.\n(2) \nConsists of 4,859 thousand shares subject to deferred stock awards, zero shares subject to stock options, zero stock appreciation rights and 2,039 thousand shares subject to performance awards (assuming payout at 100% for all awards, including awards for which performance is uncertain).\n(3) \nConsists of shares subject to deferral.\nIndividual directors who are not our employees have received stock awards and cash retainers, both of which may be deferred. Directors may elect to receive shares of our common stock in place of cash. If payment is in the form of common stock, the number of shares is determined by dividing the approved cash amount by the closing price on the date of the annual shareholders’ meeting or date of grant, if different. All deferred shares, whether stock awards or common stock received in place of cash retainers, are increased to reflect dividends paid on the common stock and, for certain directors, may include share amounts in respect of an accrual under a terminated retirement plan.\nPursuant to State Street’s Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, non-employee directors may elect to defer the receipt of 0% or 100% of their (1) retainers, (2) meeting fees or (3) annual equity grant award. Non-employee directors also may elect to receive their retainers in cash or shares of common stock. Non-employee directors who elect to defer the cash payment of their retainers or meeting fees may choose from four notional investment fund returns for such deferred cash. Deferrals of common stock are adjusted to reflect the hypothetical reinvestment in additional shares of common stock for any dividends or distributions on State Street common stock. Deferred amounts will be paid (a) as elected by the non-employee director, on either the date of their termination of service on the Board or on the earlier of such termination and a future date specified, and (b) in the form elected by the non-employee director as either a lump sum or in installments over a two- to five-year period.\nStock awards totaling 287,895 shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2024; awards made through June 30, 2003, totaling 7,294 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2024, have not been approved by shareholders. There are no other equity compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance that have been adopted without shareholder approval. Awards of stock made or retainer shares paid to individual directors after June 30, 2003 have been or will be made under our 1997, 2006 or 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, which were approved by shareholders.\nITEM 13.
