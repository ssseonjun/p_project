  "item1_summary": " Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations . Failure to address cost pressures, including rising costs for commodities, labor, health care and utilities used by our restaurants, could compress our margins .\n We are also subject to the general risks of inflation and its impact on the macroeconomic environment . We operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage . We attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing, but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively .\n The full-service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international, national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences . The performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends, severe weather including hurricanes, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants .\n Try-wide cost pressures have affected and can continue to affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings . Economic uncertainty has caused and may continue to cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases, and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance .\n A shortage of qualified candidates who meet all legal citizenship or work authorization requirements could affect our ability to open new restaurants, grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost objectives . Anticipated changes in immigration laws and regulations could decrease the pool of candidates with legal work authorizations, cause disruption in the workforce . An inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to team member dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction, higher turnover, litigation and unionization .\n Our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other leadership team members . We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management team members in order to achieve our current business objectives and support our projected growth . Unplanned changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives .\n Food-related pandemics, outbreaks of flu, viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business . The U.S. and other countries have experienced outbreaks of viruses, such as the novel coronavirus that caused COVID-19 . The decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses .\n If a virus is transmitted by human contact or respiratory transmission, our employees or guests could become infected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places . We also could be adversely affected if the World Health Organization and/or The United States Centers for Disease Control were to restrict travel to affected geographic areas where we source our products .\n Social media has dramatically increased the speed with which negative publicity, including actual or perceived food safety incidents, is disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to investigate, respond to and address an issue . The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins .\n Our ability to effectively manage our business depends on reliability, security and capacity of our systems . Failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to our team members or guests . If we fail to implement emerging technologies as quickly and efficiently as our competitors, we may lose guests or employees .\n Technology is increasingly complex and cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, more difficult to detect, contain and mitigate . Failure of our or our service providers’ information systems to function as intended could result in loss of revenue, assets, personal data, intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data . The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify cybersecurity risks .\n Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, cyber and other laws . Such breaches could trigger data breach notification laws, including new disclosure rules promulgated by the SEC . We may incur increased costs to comply with privacy and data protection laws, and, if we fail to comply or our systems are compromised, we could be subject to government enforcement actions .\n The inability to successfully integrate the Chuy's brand’s operations into our business could harm our ability to achieve the sales growth, cost savings and other benefits we expect to be able to realize from Chuy’‘s operations’ The integration of the ‘Chuy's‘ business into our operations is a complex, costly, costly process .\n We expect that the acquisition of Chuy’s will result in various benefits for the combined company including, among others, business and growth opportunities . Increased competition and/or deterioration in business conditions may limit or delay our ability to expand this business . The restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations .\n The myriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multi-state employer . Different standards apply to different locations, sometimes with conflicting requirements . We must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws . We are subject to federal, state, and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions .\n There also has been increasing focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters, such as climate change . Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liabili .\n The full-service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing, service, location, personnel, take-out and delivery options and type and quality of food . We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items . We also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services .\n Consumers are continually changing health and dietary preferences . New information or changes in dietary, nutritional, allergen or health guidelines or environmental or sustainability concerns may cause some groups of consumers to select foods other than those offered by our restaurants . If we fail to anticipate changing trends or other consumer preferences, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected .\n Many social media platforms publish content their subscribers and participants post without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted . Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate . The dissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information’s accuracy .\n The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation . A failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics, ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives, and increased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our sales and results of operations .\n As of May 25, 2025, 2,065 of our 2,159 restaurants operating in the United States and Canada operate in leased locations . Climate change and government regulation relating to climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, could result in construction delays and increased costs, interruptions to the availability or increases in the cost of utilities, and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies .\n Many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one Florida location . As a result, ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations . We may be required to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks .\n Shortages, delays or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by severe weather; natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, wildfires and earthquakes . Such shortages could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants .\n As part of our business strategy, we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing same-restaurant sales at existing restaurants, continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands, and acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably . This strategy involves numerous risks, and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives . Failure to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence may also result in restaurant closures .\n The ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks, such as the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations . The opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on guest counts and sales levels at existing restaurants . At each potential location, we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites .\n A lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations . Possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations . The expenses of opening, closing, relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated .\n Certain of our domestic and all of our international locations other than in Canada are operated by franchisees or licensees . The probability of opening, ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee or licensee . There is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue .\n Expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation . Volatility in the market value of derivatives we may use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity and broader market prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings . We use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient, labor and energy costs .\n Equity hedges in place to protect the Company from exposure to market risk related to future payout of equity-based compensation awards . Failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business . We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, trademarks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws .\n Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters, our reporting of such matters, or sustainability ratings could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition . Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant . Failure to adequately update, accomplish or accurately track and report on these commitments on a timely basis could adversely affect our reputation, financial performance and growth .\n Our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, guests, suppliers, business partners, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation . The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify . The magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown .\n The good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business . Allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, for example, could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention . Even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm our own brands .\n The ability to make scheduled payments or to obtain financing for other purposes will depend on the availability of credit . Adverse publicity could have a negative effect on the financial and social implications of the credit market . It could also affect the availability and cost of credit in the future, which is dependent on the amount of money owed to the company .\n A lack of credit could have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers, landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located . A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists . Factors may include a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a sustained, significant decline of our stock price and market capitalization .\n We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable .
