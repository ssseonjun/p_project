  "item1_text": "Item 1A. Risk F\nactors.\n\n\n \n\n\nFor a business as large and globally diverse as Domino’s, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the SEC, we believe the most significant risk factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n\n \n\n\nBusiness, Operational and Industry Risks\n\n\n \n\n\nThe quick service restaurant (“QSR”) pizza category and the food service and food delivery markets in general are highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the U.S., we compete primarily against regional and independent or local companies as well as national chains Pizza Hut\n®\n, Papa John’s\n®\n and Little Caesars Pizza\n®\n. Internationally, we compete primarily with Pizza Hut\n®\n, Papa John’s\n®\n and country-specific national, regional and independent or local companies. We have and may continue to experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the delivery and carryout pizza categories, in addition to competition from order and delivery aggregators both in the pizza category and more broadly, that may create further pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share. Competition for both customers and drivers from these order and delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has substantially increased as order and delivery aggregators have grown in size and scale. Additionally, we face competition from supermarkets and meal kit and food delivery providers, with the improvement of prepared food and meal kit offerings, expansion in meal delivery platforms and services and the trend towards convergence in grocery, deli, retail and restaurant services.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also compete more broadly with QSRs and other international, national, regional and independent or local restaurants. The overall food service market, food delivery market and the QSR market are intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price, service, image, convenience and concept, and are often affected by changes in:\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nconsumer tastes and perceptions;\n\n\n•\ninternational, national, regional or local economic conditions;\n\n\n•\nmarketing, advertising and pricing, including both price increases and discounting, and publicity;\n\n\n•\ndisposable purchasing power and demographic trends; and\n\n\n•\ncurrency fluctuations and geopolitical considerations related to international operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe compete within the food service market and the QSR market not only for customers, but also for management and employees, including store team members, drivers and qualified franchisees, as well as suitable real estate sites. We and our franchisees have faced at times a competitive labor market in recent years, which caused us and our franchisees, in certain cases, to make operational changes and delay store openings, which could ultimately impact our growth and competitive position. While the Company saw an increase in sales in certain markets, including within the U.S., at times in recent years, including higher sales related to heightened reliance on delivery and carryout businesses, future sales are not possible to estimate, and it is unclear what future sales will be. Our success is also dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the goodwill and reputation of our brand, our customers’ connection to our brand, and a positive relationship with our franchisees and the communities in which we and our franchisees operate.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers. While substantially all U.S. franchisees purchased food and other products from us and our suppliers in 2024, U.S. franchisees are not required to purchase food and other products from us, and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers. If other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and, as a result, our franchisees chose not to purchase from our U.S. supply chain centers, our financial condition, business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\n\n \n\n\nIf we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, loss of management or employees, reduced service levels, disruption in our supply chain, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities, store closures and the loss of market share, all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n15\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIf we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes opening new stores and generating more sales, our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected.\n\n\n \n\n\nA significant component of our Hungry for MORE growth strategy includes the opening of new U.S. (both Company-owned as well as franchised stores) and international franchised stores to generate more global retail sales and ultimately increase operating income. We may not be able to execute our strategy to achieve our planned growth targets. We and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores, including, among others:\n\n\n•\nconstruction, permitting or development delays;\n\n\n•\nemployment and training of qualified personnel, including availability of store team members; \n\n\n•\nselection and availability of suitable new store sites and the ability to renew leases in quality locations;\n\n\n•\navailability and negotiation of leases and financing with acceptable terms;\n\n\n•\nsecuring required U.S. or foreign governmental permits, licenses and approvals; and\n\n\n•\ngeneral economic and business conditions, including increases in food costs, build costs and labor costs which could impact profitability and demand for new stores.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe opening of additional franchise stores also depends, in part, upon the availability of suitable prospective franchisees who meet our criteria, the ability of these franchisees to attract and retain qualified personnel and their desire to open new stores and ability to operate those stores effectively. Our failure to add new stores or closures of existing stores would impact global retail sales and adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income. Additionally, our growth strategy and the success of new stores depend in large part on the availability of suitable store sites and leases. We and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our U.S. and international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in select new markets. This may require considerable management time as well as start-up expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated. Operations in new markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. In addition, we expect to continue our strategy of building additional stores in markets and regions where we have existing stores, a strategy we refer to as “fortressing,” which may negatively impact sales at existing stores. This strategy could also result in store closures if executed too rapidly, as seen in certain international markets in recent years. Therefore, as we continue to expand, we or our franchisees may not experience the gross margins we expect, our results of operations may be negatively impacted, and our stock price may decline. Our net store growth figures could also be impacted by higher closure rates. Additionally, we have an equity investment in DPC Dash Ltd (“DPC Dash”), as further discussed elsewhere in this report. Through its subsidiaries, DPC Dash serves as the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. These types of investments are inherently risky. If DPC Dash does not succeed or is unable to successfully execute its growth strategy, we could lose some or all of our investment value.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may decide to increase or decrease the number of Company-owned stores, either by refranchising existing Company-owned stores or by purchasing existing franchised stores, as we have done in the past. Our failure to successfully execute these transactions could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline.\n\n\n \n\n\nAnother component of our growth strategy also involves our participation on the third-party order aggregator marketplace. This avenue for sales may prove to be unsuccessful and sales may not meet our expectations. Our presence on the order aggregator marketplace also introduces us to additional risks and uncertainties including the risk that orders on this marketplace may not have the same level of store-level profitability as orders through our owned channels. Our operating results and stock price may be adversely affected if we are not successful on order aggregator platforms.\n\n\n \n\n\nIncreases in food, labor and other costs, labor shortages or negative economic conditions could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn recent years, there have been and may continue to be significant increases in food costs and labor costs, which have impacted and could further impact our profitability and that of our franchisees and which could impact the opening of new U.S. and international franchised stores, lead to store closures and adversely affect our operating results. Economic conditions, including the inflationary pressures seen in recent years, may also impact the discretionary purchasing power of our customers, especially customers with less disposable income or for whom discretionary spending represents a smaller portion of their disposable income, resulting in decreased demand for our products. Matters having a broad global economic impact may also significantly impact particular costs, such as the impact of geopolitical conflict on our and our international master franchisees’ transportation and energy costs. Health epidemics or pandemics have in the past and may in the future impact macroeconomic conditions, consumer behavior, labor availability and supply chain management, as well as local operations in impacted markets.\n\n\n \n16\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLabor shortages and increased turnover rates for our team members and those of our franchisees in recent years have led to and could in the future lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain team members and could negatively affect our and our franchisees’ ability to efficiently operate our respective businesses and result in a negative impact on service and customer experience.\n \n\n\nFactors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee health and benefit costs, increased rent costs, increased transportation costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs and profitability and those of our franchisees and could result in menu price increases, which could impact consumer demand. An economic environment characterized by high unemployment, high interest rates, cautious consumer spending, or changes in consumer practices due to a possible recession could also impact consumer spending or demand and our operating results. Most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and, in many cases, we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees and to the extent we were to raise menu prices to offset these costs, could result in decreased consumer demand, sales and profitability.\n\n\nMost ingredients used in our pizza, particularly cheese, are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality, weather, demand and other factors and we have experienced increased volatility in prices for some ingredients in recent years. Cheese, in particular, is a significant cost to us, representing approximately 25% of the food basket purchased by our Company-owned stores.\n\n\n \n\n\nAdditionally, while we strive to engage in a competitive bidding process for our ingredients, because certain of these ingredients, including meat products, may only be available from a limited number of vendors, we may not always be able to do so effectively. Furthermore, if we need to seek new suppliers, including as a result of expiration of existing supply agreements, we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable to us than those reflected in our current supply arrangements. Labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our and our franchisees’ store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and, generally, are also a function of the availability of labor. In addition to the increases in labor costs described above, several jurisdictions in which we and our franchisees operate have recently approved minimum wage increases. Federal, state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters could, to the extent implemented, materially increase labor and other costs. As more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases, we expect that labor costs will continue to increase. For example, labor and regulatory compliance costs could be adversely impacted as a result of California Assembly Bill No. 1228 (AB 1228), which raised the minimum wage for employees of restaurants that are part of a national fast food chain effective April 1, 2024. The increased labor costs at franchised restaurants in California could impact their profitability and the desire to open new stores or renew the franchise agreements for existing stores and result in additional price increases, which could impact demand for our products or lead to operational changes. Further, this bill could prompt similar legislation in other states or localities. The advent of legislation aimed at predictive scheduling may impact labor for our stores and our franchisees’ stores. Additionally, while we only have a small number of unionized employees in our international operations, certain employees of other companies in our industry have recently become unionized in the U.S. If a significant portion of our or our franchisees’ employees were to become unionized, our and our franchisees’ labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other union requirements that increase costs, disrupt our business, reduce flexibility and impact employee culture. Further, our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived. Labor costs and food costs, including cheese, generally represent approximately 55% to 65% of the sales at a typical Company-owned store.\n\n\n \n\n\nShortages, interruptions or disruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products and store equipment could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our specifications as well as adequate supply of store equipment. We have single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for certain of our ingredients, including pizza cheese and meat toppings. While we believe there are adequate reserve quantities and potential alternative suppliers, shortages, interruptions, or disruptions in the supply of food products and store equipment caused by increased demand, capacity constraints, expiration of existing agreements, problems in production or distribution, product recalls, financial or other difficulties of suppliers, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients and equipment. We have in the past experienced disruptions within our supply chain resulting from, among other things, capacity, volume, systems, staffing and operational challenges and may experience such supply chain disruptions again in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operational results. Additionally, the effects of climate change could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations and could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n17\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions. Changes in these preferences and perceptions may reduce the demand for our products, which would reduce sales and harm our business.\n\n\n \n\n\nFood service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes, international, national, regional and local economic conditions, marketing, advertising, pricing and demographic trends. For instance, if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as healthier, or consumers shift away from delivery or carryout food, our business and operating results would be harmed. Moreover, because we are primarily dependent on a single product, if consumer demand for pizza should decrease, our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu and the QSR pizza category may also not grow as quickly as other categories within the food service industry. The preferences of customers also may change as a result of advances in technology or alternative delivery methods or channels as well as geopolitical considerations. If we are not able to respond to these changes, or our competitors respond to these changes more effectively than us, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\n\n \n\n\nReports of product contamination, food-borne illness or food tampering or other events which may impact our reputation may reduce sales and harm our business.\n\n\n \n\n\nReports, whether true or not, of product contamination, food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations and operating results of participants in the QSR market and could in the future as well. These events could occur both at the store and supply chain center levels. If such an event were to occur, we may not be able to respond to it quickly and effectively. The potential for acts of terrorism affecting our global food supply also exists and, if such an event occurs, could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits. In addition, our reputation is an important asset; as a result, anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits. Further, a boycott or other campaign critical of us, whether domestic or international, through social media or otherwise, could negatively impact our brand’s reputation and, consequently, sales. Media reports of product contamination, illnesses and injuries, whether accurate or not, could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores. Moreover, as further described below, social media has dramatically increased the rate at which negative publicity, including as it relates to food-borne illness, can be disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond to or address an issue. Even reports of food-borne illnesses or food tampering occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could, by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry in general, adversely affect us on a local, regional, national or international basis. Our international operations expose us to further risk as our master franchisees are responsible for obtaining their own supply of food and equipment, subject to their compliance with our quality standards. A decrease in sales due to these health concerns, any negative publicity or as a result of the closure of any Domino’s stores could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe do not have long-term contracts with certain of our suppliers, or have contracts which are set to expire, and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe do not have long-term contracts or arrangements, or have contracts which are set to expire, with certain of our suppliers. Although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers, our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements, including those that may result from increases in volume, in a timely fashion or at all. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our supply chain centers to deliver necessary products to our stores and those of our franchisees and on our results of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nAny prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the U.S., we operate 22 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers, two thin crust manufacturing facilities and one vegetable processing center to our U.S. and certain international stores. We also operate five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in Canada. We plan to continue investing in supply chain productivity initiatives in the future. Our U.S. dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our Company-owned and substantially all of our U.S. franchise stores. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to technical, systems, operational or labor difficulties, destruction or damage to the facility, real estate issues, limited capacity or other reasons, or our failure to successfully increase capacity and open new centers, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n18\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur international operations subject us to additional risk. Such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the U.S. Our financial condition and results of operations have at times been and may in the future be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchised stores compete are affected by changes in political, economic or other factors. These factors, many over which neither we nor our master franchisees have control, may include both internal and external factors including:\n \n\n\n \n\n\n•\nrecessionary or expansive trends in international markets and global markets and economic downturns;\n\n\n•\nchanging labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations;\n\n\n•\nincreases in the taxes we pay and other changes in applicable tax laws both in the U.S. and globally;\n\n\n•\ntariffs and trade barriers or foreign policy changes;\n\n\n•\nlegal and regulatory changes, and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of foreign laws;\n\n\n•\nchanges in inflation rates or foreign exchange rates and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;\n\n\n•\nongoing and new relationships between our master franchisees and order and delivery aggregators our master franchisees may partner with internationally and the success of those aggregators and relationships;\n\n\n•\ndifficulty in collecting our royalties and longer payment cycles;\n\n\n•\nexpropriation of private enterprises;\n\n\n•\nthe inherent risk of doing business in China resulting from our equity investment in DPC Dash;\n\n\n•\nnational and international conflicts, sanctions, acts of war or terrorist acts;\n\n\n•\nincreases in anti-American sentiment and the identification of Domino’s as an American brand, including those seen as a result of the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and further escalations and the impact thereof; and\n\n\n•\npolitical and economic instability and uncertainty around the world and related geopolitical risk.\n\n\n \n\n\nAdditionally, an increase in tariffs, such as the tariffs announced on February 1, 2025 on imports to the United States from Canada and Mexico, and any similar or retaliatory tariffs or trade policies, could disrupt and increase the costs of our supply chains and those of our master franchisees in relation to certain products that we and they source internationally.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur earnings and business growth strategy depend on the success of our franchisees, and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees, or employees of our franchisees, which are outside of our control.\n\n\n \n\n\nA significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties and fees generated by our franchise stores. Franchisees are independent operators, and their employees are not our employees. We provide tools that franchisees can consider using in training their employees, but the quality of franchise store operations and our brand and branded products may be diminished by numerous factors beyond our control. Consequently, franchisees may not operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or they or their employees may take other actions that adversely affect the value of our brand and harm our business and reputation. Our success also depends in part on continuing positive relationships with our franchisees (and positive relationships between our international master franchisees and their corresponding sub-franchisees) and if those relationships were to deteriorate, our revenues and stock price could decline. While we try to ensure that franchisees maintain the quality of the Domino’s brand and branded products and comply with their franchise agreements, franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation or that are inconsistent with their contractual obligations. Although our franchise arrangements permit the applicable franchisor to terminate a franchise agreement in certain circumstances, including the failure by franchisees to uphold product or operating standards, there is no assurance that such remedy will be available or sufficient to prevent harm to our brand and protect our intellectual property.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 29, 2024, we had 751 independent U.S. franchisees operating 6,722 U.S. stores. As of that same date, 22 of these franchisees each owned and operated more than 50 U.S. stores, including our largest U.S. franchisee who owned and operated 158 stores, and the average U.S. franchisee owned and operated approximately nine stores. Our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our U.S. franchisees. As a result, our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our U.S. operations. As of December 29, 2024, our largest international master franchisee operated 3,741 stores in 12 markets, which accounted for approximately 26% of our total international store count. Our U.S. and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully. If one or more of our key franchisees were to be unsuccessful, become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\n\n \n19\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIf we were to be unable or fail to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media or become the subject of a boycott, our business could be adversely impacted.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe use of social media platforms and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other brand-damaging behaviors. Negative publicity related to our brand, products, operations, or stores or related to our operations or actions by our executives, team members or franchisees and their team members or others perceived to be associated with our brand could harm our business, brand, reputation, marketing partners, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of the accuracy of such negative publicity. Failure to use or respond to social media campaigns effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur success depends in part upon effective advertising, and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the Domino’s Pizza brand.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have been routinely named a Leading National Advertiser by Advertising Age and our success depends in part on continued effective advertising. Each Domino’s store located in the U.S. is obligated to contribute 6.0% of its sales to DNAF, which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local market-level advertising. We currently anticipate that this 6.0% obligation will remain in place for the foreseeable future, though the actual contribution rate could be lower in certain instances due to certain incentives and waivers. From March 27, 2023 through March 24, 2024, the Company effectuated a temporary reduction of 0.25% to its standard 6.0% advertising contribution. While additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us, our franchisees and other third parties, none of these additional funds are legally required. The lack of continued financial support for advertising activities or a limitation on our ability to advertise certain offers could significantly curtail our marketing efforts, which may in turn affect our business and our operating results.\n\n\n \n\n\nLoss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Russell J. Weiner and Joseph H. Jordan, each of these executives may terminate his agreement on ninety days’ notice and our other executive officers may do the same. As a result, we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhile we do not have long-term employment agreements with our executive officers, for all of our executive officers we have non-compete and non-solicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer’s employment. Our success will also continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores, dough manufacturing and supply chain centers, corporate offices and international operations. The loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, including general managers or other store-level team members, or our inability to adequately respond to changes in the labor market, could adversely affect our operating results. Changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees and may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies’ policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, domain names, patents, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks in order to capitalize on our name recognition, increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both U.S. and international markets. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Not all of the trademarks or domain names that we currently use or contemplate using have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and they may never be registered in all of these countries. Some countries’ laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all, or make them more difficult to enforce, and third parties may have filed for “Domino’s” or similar marks in countries where Domino’s has not registered its brand for reasons including lack of presence by the brand where actual use is required to obtain trademark registration.\n \n\n\n \n20\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, certain countries have use requirements to maintain a trademark registration. In those countries where we do not currently operate but have registered trademarks, we may be unable to renew those registrations when they expire due to non-use. Accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks everywhere in the world and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition. All of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property globally may not be adequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. We may, from time to time, be required to institute or defend litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, or to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, or damage to our employee and business relationships, any of which could subject us to loss and harm our brand.\n\n\n \n\n\nA cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers, franchisees, suppliers or employees. Many retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced, and we may further be negatively impacted to the extent outdated or legacy systems cease to function appropriately. We have in the past been and in the future may also be subject to negative impacts to our business caused by cyber incidents relating to our third-party service providers or the service providers of those third parties or our franchisees.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationships with customers, franchisees and employees, private data exposure, including payment card or other financial data, public relations impact and regulatory fines. In addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, we have also implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by others, including by our service providers and these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our reputation and financial results will not be materially and adversely affected by such an incident. Our business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that could result from such disaster or disruption, and insurance and other safeguards may only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all. Artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe depend on the performance of suppliers, aggregators and other third parties in our business operations. Third-party business processes we utilize include information technology, gift card authorization and processing, payment processing, benefits, and other accounting and business services. The failure of our suppliers, aggregators and other third parties to maintain adequate controls or comply with our expectations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our and our franchisees’ operations depend upon our ability and the ability of franchisees, third-party service providers and the service providers of those third parties (as well as franchisees’ third-party service providers and the service providers of those third parties) to protect computer equipment and systems against damage from theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure and other catastrophic or unanticipated events, as well as internal and external security incidents, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks and other intentional or unintentional disruptions. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of AI technologies amplifies these concerns.\n\n\nA significant portion of our retail sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, including DOM OS, our online and mobile ordering platforms and our credit card processing systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, stemming from maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, a compromise in our security or other unanticipated problems has at times in the past and in the future could result in interruptions to or delays in our and our franchisees’ operations, and some of our systems are not fully redundant. The occurrence of a natural disaster, intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in service. Increases in remote working could also exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased risk of cyber incidents and improper dissemination of personal or confidential information.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n21\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain and upgrade our systems, errors or vulnerabilities in our systems, or damage to or failure of our systems, including because of systems becoming obsolete, could result in interruptions in our services and non-compliance with certain laws or regulations, which could reduce our sales, revenues and profits and damage our business and brand.\n\n\n \n\n\nBecause we and our franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers including credit cards, our business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including sensitive financial data and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that are maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide payment processing. A weakness in such third party’s systems or software products (or in the systems or software products in the service providers of those third parties) may provide a mechanism for a cyber threat. In recent years, a significant number of companies have experienced data breaches in which customer information was stolen through vendor access channels. Cyber-attacks and data breaches at a payment processing contractor could compromise confidential information or adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. There is also a potential heightened risk of cyber security incidents as a result of geopolitical events outside of our control. These problems could negatively affect our results of operations, and remediation could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also maintain important internal Company data, such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations. In addition, more than 85% of our U.S. retail sales in 2024 were derived from digital channels, primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications, where customers enter personally identifiable information that we retain. Our use and retention of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign, federal and state laws and regulations, as well as by certain third-party agreements. For example, the State of California has adopted the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, an amendment to the California Consumer Privacy Act, and several other states have adopted similar comprehensive data protection laws, which may require companies to change their practices for handling of personal data, including allowing consumers to request that we delete certain personal data. In addition, the State of New York promulgated the New York SHIELD Act, like laws in several other states, which imposes obligations on businesses to implement physical, administrative and technical security measures to protect personal data. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure that we are in compliance with those laws and regulations, and our current and future planned uses of personal and other data may be adversely affected by future adopted privacy and information security laws, regulations and rulings. If our security and information systems are compromised or if we, our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, or to successfully implement processes related to requirements, laws and regulations governing cyber incidents, it could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups. This could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and cash flows, increased fees payable to third parties and fines, penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations. Any other material disruption or other adverse event affecting one or more of our digital ordering platforms, including, for instance, power loss, technological or systems failures, user error or cyber-attacks, could similarly result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and cash flows and other costs, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe cannot predict the impact that new or improved technologies, alternative methods of delivery or changes in consumer or employee behavior facilitated by these technologies and alternative methods of delivery will have on our business.\n\n\n \n\n\nAdvances in technologies or alternative methods of delivery, including advances in digital ordering technology and autonomous vehicle delivery, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery could have a negative effect on our business and market position. Moreover, technology and consumer offerings continue to develop, and we expect that new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future. We may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable customer proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model. However, we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our business.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe may incorporate traditional and generative AI solutions into our business, and these solutions may become important in our operations over time. The use of these AI solutions may expose us to additional risks and expenses, including, for example, if we were to incorporate AI technologies which we become dependent on or fail to adopt AI in a timely or effective manner.\n \n\n\n \n22\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may be able to benefit more from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of alternative methods of delivery. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences, including with respect to new technologies and alternative methods of delivery, or to effectively adjust our product mix, service offerings, and marketing and merchandising initiatives for products and services that address, and anticipate advances in, technology and market trends. Alternative methods of delivery may also impact the potential labor pool from which we recruit our delivery drivers and could reduce the available supply of labor. If we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchise system and franchisees.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur franchise system subjects us to a number of additional risks, any one of which may impact our ability to collect royalty payments and fees from our franchisees, may harm the goodwill associated with our brand, and/or may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Such risks may also apply to us as owners of stores. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nthose relating to the application of local, state, federal and foreign bankruptcy laws and other applicable laws governing creditors’ rights generally and the impact such laws could have on our ability to collect payments and fees under applicable franchise agreements;\n\n\n•\nthose relating to franchisees that are operating entities, which generally are not limited-purpose entities, including business, operational, credit, financial and other risks in addition to risks related to unions;\n\n\n•\nthose relating to franchisee changes in control and succession in general and the ability to find acceptable successors who are able to perform a former franchisee’s obligations under applicable franchise agreements or successfully operate impacted stores in the event of a change of control or other succession event;\n\n\n•\nthose relating to franchisee insurance, including the inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage, losses in excess of policy limits or payments not being made on a timely basis, extraordinary hazards not being subject to coverage (or only being subject to coverage at prohibitively high rates) or third parties seeking to recover losses from us to the extent those losses experienced by such third parties are either not covered by the franchisee’s insurance or exceed the policy limits of the franchisee’s insurance;\n\n\n•\nthose relating to instances of termination of or default under a franchisee’s franchise agreement or the non-renewal thereof at the end of such agreement’s expiration date and the corresponding impact on the franchisee’s or our operations;\n\n\n•\nthose relating to product liability exposure or noncompliance with labor and employment, health and safety regulations and the impact such events could have on a franchisee’s ability to make payments under applicable franchise agreements, on us if an aggrieved party seeks to recover their losses from us and on our brand’s reputation;\n\n\n•\nthe imposition of injunctive relief, fines, damage awards or capital expenditures under laws or regulations that could adversely affect the ability of a franchisee to make payments under applicable franchise agreements;\n\n\n•\nlitigation involving franchisees, including litigation involving us or litigation involving a third-party directed at a franchisee, which could impede the ability of a defendant-franchisee to make its royalty payments and divert our resources regardless of whether the allegations in such litigation are valid or whether we are liable; and\n\n\n•\nthose relating to the reliance of a franchised store business on its franchisees, both domestic and international, and the nature of franchisees in general, including the successful operations and retention of franchisees (especially including our top-performing franchisees) in the future or our ability to attract, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of franchisees of the same caliber in the future as well as our ability to maintain a positive and constructive relationship with our franchisees.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n23\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur current insurance coverage may not be adequate, insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates, or at all.\n\n\n \n\n\nFor certain periods prior to December 1998 and for periods after December 2001, we maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities. We are generally responsible for up to $1.0 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers’ compensation and up to $2.0 million per occurrence under these retention programs for general liability, depending on policy year and line of coverage. We are generally responsible for between $500,000 and $5.5 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and non-owned automobile liabilities, depending on policy year and line of coverage. Total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to $112.5 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers’ compensation. These insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business. In addition, in the future our insurance premiums may increase, and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all. Any such inadequacy of, or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance matters may impact our business and reputation.\n\n\n \n\n\nIncreasingly, in addition to the importance of their financial performance, companies are being judged by their performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, which are considered to contribute to the long-term sustainability of companies’ performance. Major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG matters to their investment decisions. We have established significant commitments on greenhouse gas emissions and in October 2024 our near-term and net zero targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We have established a commitment to achieve our near-term targets by 2032 and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Execution of these strategies and achievement of these goals are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control and may prove to be more costly than we anticipate. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, our ability to execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes; unforeseen design, operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments; the success of our collaboration with franchisees and other third parties; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve our goals. Failure to achieve our goals could damage our reputation and customer, investor and other stakeholder relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as on our stock price. There also has been increased political focus, including by U.S. and foreign governmental authorities, on environmental sustainability matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water usage; there has also been pushback to certain ESG initiatives in recent years which could also have an adverse effect in the event we were to become a target of pushback or subject to additional regulatory measures. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other ESG concerns could also result in new or more stringent forms of oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure, which could increase costs, bring additional focus and further impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any failure or perceived failure by us to manage ESG issues successfully could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our business, results of operations, financial condition or stock price.\n\n\n \n\n\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\n\n \n\n\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 29, 2024, our consolidated total indebtedness was approximately $4.98 billion. We may also incur additional debt, which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for our business and our shareholders. For example, it could:\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt agreements;\n\n\n•\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\n\n•\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes; and\n\n\n•\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers that may have less debt.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n24\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFurther, our 2021 and 2022 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates that in certain circumstances is based on a forward-looking term rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”). There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “New York Fed”) will continue the publication of Term SOFR, and if the New York Fed discontinues the publication of Term SOFR, interest payments on our 2021 Variable Funding Notes and 2022 Variable Funding Notes would need to be calculated using a different index, or alter the manner in which Term SOFR is calculated. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur interest expense could also be increased by rising interest rates. In addition, the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, pay dividends and engage in other transactions, and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness.\n\n\n \n\n\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur debt is rated by credit rating agencies. These agencies may downgrade their credit ratings for us based on the performance of our business, our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding indebtedness will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. A downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things, increase our cost of borrowing, limit our ability to access capital or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur, and thereby could adversely impact our business and operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, in the amounts projected or at all, or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity. If we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to affect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all, our business may be harmed.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default, which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects.\n\n\n \n\n\nUnless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt, we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings. The securitized debt, under which certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes, contain a number of covenants, with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation. These covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nsell assets and incur liens;\n\n\n•\nalter the business we conduct and engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;\n\n\n•\nincur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees and make loans and investments; \n\n\n•\ndeclare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock; and\n\n\n•\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter. These restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock. Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy such a test. A breach of these covenants could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt. If amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts, the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n25\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring the term following issuance, the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest in accordance with the terms of the debt agreements. Additionally, our senior notes have original scheduled principal payments of $1.18 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $817.9 million in 2028, $631.0 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $912.5 million in 2031.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if the Holdco Leverage Ratio for the Company is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, each as defined in the indenture governing our securitized debt, and no catch-up provisions are applicable.\n\n\n \n\n\nIf we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the term, our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt which would become due and payable on an accelerated schedule, and, other than technology fees and a weekly management fee sufficient to cover certain general and administrative expenses, would not be available for operating our business. No assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing. The indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events, cash flow would be further restricted. In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of its term), the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.\n\n\n \n\n\nRegulatory, Legal and Compliance Risks\n\n\n \n\n\nWe face risks of litigation, investigations, enforcement actions and negative publicity from customers, franchisees, suppliers, employees, regulators and others in the ordinary course of business, which could divert our financial and management resources. Litigation, investigations, enforcement actions or publicity may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nClaims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry, and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business. We are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past. Claims within our industry of improper supplier actions also occasionally arise that, if made against one of our suppliers, could potentially damage our brand image.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, class action lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, against various QSRs alleging, among other things, that QSRs have failed to disclose the health risks associated with certain foods and that QSR marketing practices have encouraged obesity. State attorney general offices or other regulators have initiated and may in the future initiate investigations or enforcement actions against us. In addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources, adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially and adversely affect us and our brand, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable, and could result in a substantial settlement, fine, penalty or judgment against us. Further, we may be subject to employee, franchisee and other claims in the future based on claims of, among other things, discrimination, harassment, working and safety conditions, wrongful termination and wage, expense reimbursement, rest break and meal break issues, including claims relating to minimum wage and overtime compensation. We and our international master franchisees have been and continue to be subject to these types of claims. If one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\n\n\nWe and our franchisees are subject to extensive laws and government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\n\n \n26\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as requirements issued by other groups, including those relating to:\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nthe preparation, sale and labeling of food;\n\n\n•\nbuilding and zoning requirements and environmental protection;\n\n\n•\nlabor and employment, including minimum wage, overtime, insurance, discrimination and other labor requirements as well as working and safety conditions;\n\n\n•\nfranchise arrangements;\n\n\n•\ntaxation;\n\n\n•\nantitrust;\n\n\n•\npayment card industry standards and requirements; and\n\n\n•\nadvertising, social media, information privacy and consumer protection.\n\n\n \n\n\nIt is uncertain how the policy priorities and initiatives of the new administration may impact the federal laws and regulations to which we are subject, and we are not able to predict the impact such changes may have on our business.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are subject to an FTC rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises. These laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe and our franchisees face various regulatory and legislative efforts to enforce employment laws, such as efforts to categorize franchisors as the co-employers or joint employers of their franchisees’ employees or to aggregate individual franchised businesses and classify them as large employers for minimum wage or other employment-related purposes. In October 2023, the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) adopted a final rule with a new and broader standard grounded in common law agency principles for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the National Labor Relations Act (the “NLRA”). While the NLRB’s final rule was vacated in April 2024, returning the law to the NLRB’s prior rule that entities can be considered joint employers if they process and actually exercise “substantial direct and immediate control,” if a broader rule is ultimately enacted or adopted by the NLRB or other government agencies and/or applied generally to franchise relationships, it could cause us to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations of our franchisees and subject us to other liabilities, and require us to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate, independent employers, most notably our franchisees. In such event, our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices, increased litigation, governmental investigations or proceedings, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil liability. Additionally, based upon the outcome and application of recent legal proceedings in federal court in California involving the California wage and hour laws in another franchise system, franchisors may be subject to claims that their franchisees should be treated as employees and not as independent contractors under the wage and hour laws of that state and, potentially, certain other states and localities with similar wage and hour laws. The California legislature has enacted a statute known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB-5), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. AB-5 requires “gig economy” workers to be reclassified as employees instead of independent contractors. However, depending upon the application of AB-5, franchisors in certain industries could be deemed to be covered by the statute, in which event certain franchisees could be deemed employees of the franchisors. While active efforts to narrow the reach of AB-5 continue, a bill (SB 967), which was introduced specifically to exempt the relationship between a franchisor and franchisee from the scope of AB-5, was not successful in the legislature.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn November 3, 2020, the California electorate approved proposition 22, the effect of which is to exempt app-based transportation (ride shares) and delivery drivers from the application of AB-5 by treating these workers as independent contractors, rather than employees, provided certain conditions are met. The ballot measure does not affect how AB-5 applies to other businesses and workers. Given that misclassification claims have been successful against or applied to a franchisor under AB-5 and may be successful under similar state laws, a franchisor could be liable to its franchisees (and potentially their employees) based the rights and remedies available to employees under such laws and, thereafter, have to treat its franchisees (and their employees) as the franchisor’s employees under these laws.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n27\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe and our franchisees are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (the “FLSA”), which, along with the Family and Medical Leave Act, governs such matters as minimum wage and overtime requirements and other working conditions and various family leave mandates, as well as a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated, by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters. We and our franchisees have experienced and expect further increases in payroll expenses as a result of government-mandated increases in the minimum wage, some specific to employees of national fast-food chains, which may be material, including as a result of California’s AB 1228. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for Domino’s and franchisees’ stores in a particular area or across the United States. In addition, third-party suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. Such increased expenses may cause our franchisees to exit the business or cause us to reduce the number of Company-owned stores, or otherwise adversely affect the amount of royalty payments and license fees we receive. On January 12, 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor announced a final rule to update and clarify the definition of joint employer under the FLSA. Under the final rule, the general test for assessing whether a party can be deemed a joint employer would be based upon whether that party (i) hires or fires the employee; (ii) supervises and controls the employee’s work schedule or conditions of employment; (iii) determines the employee’s rate and method of payment; and (iv) maintains the employee’s employment records. In the final rule, the Department of Labor describes instances in which joint employment would not be more or less likely to be found to exist under the FLSA, which, according to the Department of Labor, includes the relationships that exist under the typical franchise business model. This rule may reduce a franchisor’s risk of liability that currently exists under the joint employer standard now in effect under the FLSA (though ultimately, the facts specific to the franchisor-franchisee model at issue would be considered when determining liability). On July 29, 2021, the Department of Labor issued a final rule rescinding the 2020 rule. The Department of Labor may revert to the more expansive interpretation of joint employer that existed prior to the adoption of the 2020 rule and/or interpretations that could result in franchisors being held liable or responsible for FLSA violations by their franchisees. The rules of the Department of Labor are separate from the joint employer standard under the NLRA or, as described above, potential liability as a joint employer under the NLRA.\n\n\n \n\n\nLaws targeting hidden fees and how businesses may advertise and/or market prices to consumers have been enacted in jurisdictions that include California and Minnesota, and these laws could impact our advertising, including advertising for our national offers. To the extent our advertising is negatively impacted, our business could be adversely affected.\n\n\n \n\n\nCertain governmental authorities and private litigants have recently asserted claims against franchisors, including us, for provisions in our prior franchise agreements that restrict franchisees from soliciting or hiring the employees of other franchisees or the applicable franchisor. Claims against franchisors for such clauses include allegations that these clauses violate state and federal antitrust and unfair practices laws by restricting the free movement of employees of franchisees and/or franchisor (including the employees of Company-owned stores), thereby depressing the wages of those employees.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the “Affordable Care Act”) requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage. The majority of the increases in these costs began in 2015, and while the incremental costs of this program have not been material to us to date, we cannot predict what effect these costs will have on our results of operations and financial position, or the effects of the Affordable Care Act on some of our larger franchisees. Modifications to, or repeal of, all or certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act are also possible. Changes in tax laws or tax policy more broadly, increases in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax and/or regulate certain foods deemed to be “unhealthy,” and our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation and compliance measures related to any such laws or regulations.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAdverse government regulations and enforcement efforts or non-compliance by us or our franchisees with any of the foregoing laws and regulations could lead to various claims or governmental or judicial fines, sanctions or other enforcement measures, which could negatively impact our business.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n28\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMarket and General Risks\n\n\n \n\n\nFluctuations in value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings.\n\n\n \n\n\nExchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, and we have in the past experienced significant adverse changes in foreign currency rates. International franchise royalties and fees represented approximately 6.8%, 6.9% and 6.5% of our total revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. Sales made by franchised stores outside the U.S. are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located, and this currency could become less valuable in U.S. dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the U.S. or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the U.S., or could result in lower revenues for us, on a U.S. dollar basis, from such customers and franchisees. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately $28.2 million in 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may decline significantly or be subject to significant fluctuations.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur annual and quarterly financial results, including our sales and operating results, can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things:\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nvariations in the timing and volume of our sales and our franchisees’ sales, including same store sales;\n\n\n•\nour performance versus expectations of securities analysts or investors or against our guidance metrics;\n\n\n•\nthe timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;\n\n\n•\nchanges in the cost or availability of our ingredients or labor;\n\n\n•\nplanned or actual changes to our capital or debt structure;\n\n\n•\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as sales promotions, acquisitions or restructurings;\n\n\n•\nchanges in our dividend policy or any share repurchase program;\n\n\n•\nsignificant litigation or legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry;\n\n\n•\nchanges in competitive and economic conditions generally as well as general market conditions; and\n\n\n•\nforeign currency exposure.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs a result, our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products. Any such decline may cause us and our franchisees to experience lower sales revenue. We anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future, and such fluctuations may result in significant fluctuations or a significant decline in our stock price.\n\n\n \n29\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nItem 1B.

Cybersecurity.\n \nCybersecurity Governance\n \nThe Company’s entire Board of Directors is engaged in risk management oversight, including the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in its oversight of Domino’s company-wide risk management and the process established to identify, assess, measure, monitor and manage risks, including major information security and cybersecurity risks, with input from the Company’s internal committee dedicated to assessing and managing enterprise risk comprised of Company executives in addition to other senior leaders within the Company (the “Enterprise Risk Committee”).\n \nCybersecurity and related matters are a recurring topic at meetings of the Audit Committee and the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”) and Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) provide \nthe Audit Committee with an update on the Company’s cybersecurity risk profile and strategy at multiple Audit Committee meetings each year.\n These updates include both qualitative and quantitative information on the effectiveness of the Company’s cybersecurity controls.\n \nAt an operational level, \nthe Company’s cybersecurity strategy is shaped by its CISO who is ultimately responsible for implementing the Company’s cybersecurity policies, procedures and strategy under the oversight of the Enterprise Risk Committee.\n The Company’s CISO regularly provides updates to the Enterprise Risk Committee at relevant meetings and provides additional updates to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary and CTO on a regular basis in between the meetings of the Enterprise Risk Committee. Such updates are designed to ensure the Enterprise Risk Committee and Company executives remain informed about and are able to monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. The Company’s CISO has multiple decades of experience in the cybersecurity and information security fields with relevant experience supplemented by undergraduate and post-graduate degrees in information technology and security and completion of additional related executive education, along with holding several industry-recognized cybersecurity certifications. The Company’s CTO supplements the expertise and experience of the CISO.\n \nUnder the oversight of the Enterprise Risk Committee, relevant information regarding the Company’s cybersecurity profile and any cybersecurity threats or incidents is then communicated during the regular updates to the Audit Committee in a process designed to ensure the Board of Directors and Audit Committee maintains appropriate oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity strategy and risk profile.\n \nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n \nCybersecurity is a key component of the Company’s overall risk management system, and \nthe Company believes it has implemented robust processes that are designed to effectively manage risks from cybersecurity threats\n. In addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, the Company has also implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks. Domino’s cybersecurity program is embedded into the Company’s enterprise risk management framework from both a resource allocation and strategic initiative perspective and is supported by an extensive catalog of layered security controls that are designed to prevent and detect internal and external security threats and safeguard privacy and personal data of customers, team members, franchisees and other business partners. Domino’s maintains this comprehensive information security program with a dedicated team that is responsible for directing, coordinating, planning and organizing information security activities throughout the Company and is led by the Company’s CISO\n.\n\n\n \n30\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Company leverages a combination of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls as the scale against which to assess its information security program and invest in its ability to proactively defend against security risks within its environment. \nDomino’s conducts annual risk assessments, both internally and through the use of third parties, to evaluate the effectiveness of its security controls and identify new threats and vulnerabilities\n and appropriate controls to mitigate risks and supplements these regular assessments with ongoing monitoring. Additionally, Domino’s participates in ongoing and periodic assessments of its external platform and applications to include running a responsible disclosure program to ensure that vulnerabilities that are discovered can be reported and appropriately remediated. Domino’s has been certified as compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) standards and has several dedicated teams of specialists within its information security department that routinely conduct internal and external vulnerability and penetration assessments in accordance with both PCI DSS and industry accepted practices. \nThis team keeps the Company’s management informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents and leads the Company’s processes to oversee and identify risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the Company’s use of its third-party service providers\n. The Company additionally has established and maintains a dedicated Security Operations Center (SOC) team that is responsible for quickly identifying and treating events that could pose risk to its technology environments and that has a documented incident response plan in place, which is periodically tested, reviewed and updated as appropriate. The Company trains its team members through annual cybersecurity awareness training, phishing simulations and periodic communications about timely cybersecurity topics and threats.\n \nThe Company, its vendors and service providers and their respective vendors and service providers face various security threats on a regular basis, including ongoing cybersecurity threats to and attacks on its and their information technology infrastructure that are intended to gain access to the Company’s proprietary information, destroy or modify data or disable, degrade or sabotage systems. Cyber incident techniques change frequently, may not immediately be recognized and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including as part of the supply-chain of software and computer code that supports the software and systems on which the Company and such parties rely. There has been an increase in the frequency, sophistication and ingenuity of the data security threats the Company and these vendors and service providers face, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally to those that are more advanced and persistent.\nWhile\n the Company does not believe that any risks from cybersecurity threats (as defined in Item 106 of Regulation S-K), including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have to-date materially affected the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition\n, the occurrence of cybersecurity incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact the Company’s business by causing a disruption to its operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, or damage to the Company’s employee and business relationships, any of which could have adverse effects on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flow and harm its brand. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by others, including by the Company’s service providers. See “\nRisk Factors – The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, or damage to our employee and business relationships, any of which could subject us to loss and harm our brand\n” for further information."
