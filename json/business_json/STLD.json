These statements, which we generally precede or accompany by such typical conditional words as \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"believe\", \"estimate\", \"plan\", \"seek\", \"project\", or \"expect\", or by the words \"may\", \"will\", or \"should\", are intended to be made as \"forward-looking\", subject to many risks and uncertainties, within the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements speak only as of this date and are based upon information and assumptions, which we consider reasonable as of this date, concerning our businesses and the environments in which they operate. Such predictive statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we undertake no duty to update or revise any such statements. Some factors that could cause such forward-looking statements to turn out differently than anticipated include: (1) domestic and global economic factors; (2) global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel, together with increased scrap prices; (3) pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues; (4) the cyclical nature of the steel industry and the industries we serve; (5) volatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal, scrap substitutes and supplies, and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers; (6) cost and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil, and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions; (7) increased environmental, greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability considerations from our customers and investors or related regulations; (8) compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements; (9) significant price and other forms of competition from other steel and aluminum producers, scrap processors and alternative materials; (10) availability of an adequate source of supply of scrap for our metals recycling operations; (11) cybersecurity threats and risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology; (12) the implementation of our growth strategy; (13) our ability to retain, develop and attract key personnel; (14) litigation and legal compliance; (15) unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns; (16) governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits; (17) our senior unsecured credit facility contains, and any future financing agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility; and (18) the impacts of impairment charges.\nMore specifically, we refer you to our more detailed explanation of these and other factors and risks that may cause such predictive statements to turn out differently, as set forth in the sections titled \nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n at the beginning of Part I of this Report and",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n, as well as in other subsequent reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports are available publicly on the Securities and Exchange Commission website, \nwww.sec.gov\n, and on our website, \nwww.steeldynamics.com \nunder “Investors – SEC Filings.”\nOperating Statement Classifications\nNet Sales\n. Net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix, and related pricing. We charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes, and for value-added processing or coating of our steel products. Except for the steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and claims from these sales at the point in time control of the product transfers to the customer, upon shipment or delivery. Our steel fabrication operations recognize revenues over time based on completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract.\nCosts of Goods Sold\n. Our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products. The principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel substrate, direct and indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance, utilities such as electricity and natural gas, and depreciation.\n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments, including, among other items, labor and related benefits, and professional services. \nCompanywide profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets are each separately presented in the statements of income.\nInterest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest\n. Interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt, net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects.\nOther (Income) Expense, net\n. Other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits, short-term and other investments, and any other non-operating income activity, including income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Other expense consists of any non-operating costs, such as certain acquisition and financing expenses.\n2024 Overview\nDuring 2024 we achieved steel shipments of 12.7 million tons, our second highest annual volume behind 2023’s 12.8 million tons. Underlying domestic steel demand was stable during 2024, but imports of certain steel products, most notably coated flat rolled steels, caused pricing pressure for flat rolled steel products. While facing a challenging pricing environment throughout much of the year, our metals recycling teams maintained consistent volumes during 2024 compared to 2023. A solid non-residential construction market during 2024 benefited our steel fabrication operations, as the segment achieved historically strong volumes and average selling prices, compared to pre-Covid levels. Consolidated net sales were $17.5 billion during 2024, with cash flow from operations of $1.8 billion. Metal spread compression in our steel and, particularly, steel fabrication segments resulted in significantly lower operating income in 2024 compared to 2023.\nConsolidated operating income for 2024 decreased $1.2 billion, or 38%, to $1.9 billion, compared to $3.2 billion in 2023. Net income attributable to Steel Dynamics, Inc. for 2024 decreased $913.7 million, or 37%, to $1.5 billion, compared to 2023. Diluted earnings per share attributable to Steel Dynamics, Inc. was $9.84 for 2024, compared to $14.64 for 2023. \nRefer to Item 7. \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nin Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for additional information regarding results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, and segment operating results for 2023 as compared to 2022.

Customer order activity and steel demand were stable during 2024, with the construction, automotive, industrial, and energy sectors leading demand. In spite of strong market demand, average selling prices were lower during 2024 compared to 2023, as total steel segment average selling prices decreased 4%, or $46 per ton, compared to 2023. Net sales for the steel operations segment were 4% lower in 2024 when compared to 2023, due to lower average steel selling prices on consistent volumes.\n​\n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMetallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost, generally comprising approximately 55% to 65% of our steel mill operations’ manufacturing costs. Our metallic raw material cost consumed in our steel mills decreased $28 per net ton, or 7%, in 2024 compared to 2023, consistent with overall decreased domestic scrap pricing noted below in the metals recycling operations segment discussion.\n​\nAs a result of average selling prices decreasing more than scrap costs, specifically for long products, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average steel mill selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed in our steel mills) decreased 3% in 2024 compared to 2023. Due to metal spread compression, operating income for the steel operations decreased 16% to $1.6 billion in 2024 compared to 2023.\nMetals Recycling Operations Segment\n​\nMetals recycling operations include our OmniSource ferrous and nonferrous processing, transportation, marketing, brokerage, and scrap management services primarily throughout the United States and Mexico. Our steel mills utilize a large portion of the ferrous scrap sold by our metals recycling operations as raw material in our steelmaking operations, and the remainder is sold to other consumers, such as other steel manufacturers and foundries. In 2024 and 2023, 62% of metals recycling operations ferrous scrap was sold to our own steel mills, while our steel mill utilization remained consistent at 81% and 82% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Metals recycling operations accounted for 11% of our consolidated net sales during 2024 and 2023.\nMetals Recycling Operations Shipments:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nYears Ended December 31,\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n% Change\n​\n2023\n​\n​\nFerrous metal (gross tons)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTotal\n​\n 5,850,544\n​\n1% \n​\n 5,792,484\n​\n​\nInter-company\n​\n (3,656,034)\n​\n​\n​\n (3,593,328)\n​\n​\nExternal shipments\n​\n 2,194,510\n​\n-\n​\n 2,199,156\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNonferrous metal (thousands of pounds)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTotal\n​\n 965,491\n​\n(1)%\n​\n 970,445\n​\n​\nInter-company\n​\n (171,915)\n​\n​\n​\n (207,866)\n​\n​\nExternal shipments\n​\n 793,576\n​\n4% \n​\n 762,579\n​\n​\nSegment Results 2024 vs. 2023\nDuring 2024, our metals recycling operations continued to benefit from solid domestic steel industry demand, resulting in consistent ferrous and nonferrous scrap shipments compared to 2023. Net sales for our metals recycling operations in 2024 were comparable to 2023 based on consistent shipments. Due to a challenging pricing environment throughout much of 2024, ferrous average selling prices decreased 7% while nonferrous average selling prices increased 10% during 2024 compared to 2023.\n​\nFerrous metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap) was flat and nonferrous metal spread increased 13% during 2024 compared to 2023. As a result of the overall increased metals spreads, metals recycling operations operating income increased 61% to $76.8 million in 2024 compared to 2023.\n​\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSteel Fabrication Operations Segment\n​\nSteel fabrication operations include the company’s New Millennium Building Systems’ joist and deck plants located throughout the United States, and in Northern Mexico. Revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of girders, steel joists and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry. Steel fabrication operations accounted for 10% and 15% of our consolidated net sales during 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n​\n​\nSegment Results 2024 vs. 2023\nNet sales for the steel fabrication operations decreased 37% during 2024 compared to 2023, as average selling prices decreased 31% and volumes decreased 8% compared to 2023. Our steel fabrication operations benefited from a solid non-residential construction market, as evidenced by historically solid order backlog that extends deep into the first half of 2025 at attractive pricing levels.\n \nThe continued onshoring of manufacturing, coupled with the robust U.S. infrastructure and Inflation Reduction Act programs, supports consistent strong demand for steel joist and deck products.\nThe purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations, historically representing approximately two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing. The average cost of steel consumed decreased 5% in 2024, as compared to 2023. Due to decreased selling prices per ton more than offsetting decreased steel input costs per ton, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel) contracted 41% in 2024 compared to 2023. Metal spread compression coupled with decreased volume resulted in operating income decreasing 58% to $667.0 million in 2024, compared to $1.6 billion in 2023.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAluminum Operations Segment\n​\nAluminum operations include the recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill nearing completion of construction in Columbus, Mississippi, two satellite recycled aluminum slab centers in the southwest United States (US) and Central Mexico, and an entity with aluminum operations, formerly included in the results of our metals recycling operations segment. The aluminum flat rolled products mill and the Mexico and US recycled aluminum slab centers are expected to begin operations in mid to late 2025. Net sales relate to an entity with aluminum operations, previously reported as part of our metals recycling operations. The results of this segment largely consist of construction and start-up costs recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses, which continued to increase during 2024, consistent with increased headcount and start-up costs. \n \nOther Operations\n​\nConsolidated Results 2024 vs. 2023\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. \nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $664.1 million during 2024 increased 13% from $588.6 million during 2023 primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense related to the growth of the aluminum operations segment during 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 3.8% and 3.1% of net sales during 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nProfit sharing expense during 2024 of $164.9 million decreased 39% from $272.0 million during 2023, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. This decrease in profit sharing expense was the primary driver of decreased operating loss for other operations of 20% in 2024 compared to 2023. Profit sharing expense for eligible employees is 8% of consolidated pretax income excluding noncontrolling interests and other items. Refer to Note 10. \nRetirement Plans\n to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for further information.\nInterest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest. \nDuring 2024, interest expense of $56.3 million decreased 26% from $76.5 million during 2023. The lower interest expense in 2024 compared to 2023 is due to higher capitalized interest in 2024 ($66.8 million, compared to $33.0 million in 2023) related to our ongoing expansion projects, most notably within Aluminum Operations.\nOther (Income) Expense, net. \n Net other income was $96.2 million in 2024, compared to $144.2 million in 2023, due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate losses of $18.7 million in 2024 compared to gains of $10.5 million in 2023, as well as a $21.8 million reduction in interest income on investments in 2024 compared to 2023 due to a decrease in the balance of invested cash during 2024.\nIncome Tax Expense. \nDuring 2024, income tax expense of $432.9 million, at an effective income tax rate of 21.8%, decreased 42% compared to the $751.6 million, at an effective income tax rate of 23.3%, during 2023, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. Our effective tax rate decrease was due primarily to certain discrete tax adjustments during the third quarter and fourth quarters of 2024. Refer to Note 4. \nIncome Taxes\n to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024, are potential benefits of $26.4 million that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. We recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in income tax expense. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized expense from the increase of interest expense and penalties of $710,000, net of tax. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, we had $4.2 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2024.\nWe file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. The tax years 2021 through 2023 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and various state and local jurisdictions. At this time, we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months in an amount ranging from zero to $12.0 million, as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations and other federal and state income tax audits.\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources and Long-term Debt. \nOur business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations, and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. Our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, including expansion projects, principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, dividends to our shareholders, potential stock repurchases and acquisitions or investments. We have met and intend to continue to meet these liquidity requirements primarily with available cash and cash provided by operations, long-term borrowings, and we also have availability under our unsecured Revolver. Our liquidity at December 31, 2024, is as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCash and equivalents\n​\n$\n 589,464\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nShort-term and other investments\n​\n​\n 388,563\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nUnsecured revolver availability\n​\n​\n 1,190,741\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTotal liquidity\n​\n$\n 2,168,768\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOur total outstanding debt of $3.2 billion increased $160.0 million compared to December 31, 2023, due to our issuance of $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes in July 2024 as described in Note 3, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of our 2.800% senior notes due December 2024, working capital, capital expenditures, advances for or investments in subsidiaries, acquisitions, redemption and repayment of other outstanding indebtedness, and purchases of the company’s common stock. Our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders’ equity) was 26.5% and 25.8% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur unsecured credit agreement has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Facility)\n, which provides a $1.2 billion Revolver and matures in July 2028. Subject to certain conditions, we have the ability to increase the Facility size by $500.0 million. The unsecured Revolver is available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. The Facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability to incur indebtedness and permit liens on certain assets. Our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the unsecured Revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants. At December 31, 2024, we had $1.2 billion of availability on the Revolver, $9.3 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding.\nThe financial covenants under our Facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. Our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve-months (LTM) consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Facility (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as defined in the Facility) by our LTM gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. In addition, a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.60:1.00 must be maintained. At December 31, 2024, our interest coverage ratio and debt to capitalization ratio were 21.68:1.00 and 0.27:1.00, respectively. We were, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months.\nWorking Capital (representing excess of current assets over current liabilities). \nWe generated cash flow from operations of $1.8 billion in 2024 compared to $3.5 billion in 2023. Working capital decreased $1.2 billion, or 26%, during 2024 to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2024, due primarily to a $1.4 billion decrease in cash and equivalents and short-term investments in support of our capital investments within our aluminum and steel operations.\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCapital Investments. \nDuring 2024, we invested $1.9 billion in property, plant and equipment, primarily within our aluminum operations and steel operations segments, compared with $1.7 billion invested during 2023. \nWe are currently executing our plan to invest $2.7 billion in a new state-of-the-art lower-carbon recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill with two new supporting satellite recycled aluminum slab centers, which are being funded by available cash and cash flow from operations. Related expenditures began in the third quarter of 2022 and are expected to continue through 2025.\n Our liquidity of $2.2 billion and anticipated future operating cash flow generation is sufficient to provide for our planned 2025 capital requirements. \nCash Dividends. \nAs a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation capability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.46 per share in the first quarter of 2024 (from $0.425 per share for each quarter in 2023), resulting in declared cash dividends of $284.1 million during 2024, compared to $280.5 million in 2023. We paid cash dividends of $282.6 million and $271.3 million during 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. The determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans.\nOther. \nOur board of directors has authorized share repurchase programs during prior years, the most recent of which occurred in November 2023 for a program of up to $1.5 billion of the company’s common stock. In February 2025, our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion of our common stock. Under the share repurchase programs, purchases take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects, our cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions. The share repurchase programs do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended, extended, or terminated by us at any time. The share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date. There were $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion of share repurchases during 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had $193.5 million remaining available to purchase under the November 2023 share repurchase program. See Part II, Item 5. \nMarket for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n for additional information.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial, and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. We believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including borrowings under our Facility, if necessary, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and funding anticipated capital expenditures.\nContractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities\nWe have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. A “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nLong-term debt and estimated interest. \nRefer to Note 3. \nLong-Term Debt\n to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for our long-term debt maturities. Estimated interest payments on our senior unsecured notes were determined based on their outstanding balances through maturity at their contractual interest rates, as detailed in Note 3. Estimated interest payments also include a 0.175% commitment fee on our available Revolver, and an average interest rate of 6.23% on our other debt of $28.8 million. Our estimated interest payments are $116.4 million, $109.4 million, $89.0 million, $83.4 million, and $82.2 million, for the years 2025 through 2029, respectively, and $442.4 million thereafter.\n46\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPurchase obligations.\n We have commitments for the purchase of commodities such as electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and electrodes. Refer to Note 8. \nCommitments and Contingencies\n to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.\nConstruction commitments.\n We have firm contracts with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 8. \nCommitments and Contingencies\n to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.\nLease commitments.\n \nWe have entered into operating leases relating principally to transportation and other equipment, and some real estate. Refer to Note 11. \nLeases\n to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.\nUnrecognized tax benefits.\n We expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits; however, due to the uncertainty of the timing, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Refer to Note 4. \nIncome Taxes \nto the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.\n​\nOther Matters\nEnvironmental and Other Contingencies\nWe have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control, remediation, monitoring, and compliance. During 2024, we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately $60.2 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately $4.3 million. Of the costs incurred during 2024 for monitoring and compliance, approximately 74% were related to the normal transportation of certain types of by-products produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities in accordance with legal requirements. We incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately $4.9 million at all of our facilities during 2024. We have an accrual of $3.8 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations, $2.6 million related to our idled Minnesota ironmaking operations, and $712,000 related to our steel operations. We believe, apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. However, environmental laws and regulations evolve and change, and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future, such as the impact of various governmental legislatures and agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change. \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We review the accounting estimates we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\nImpairments of Long-Lived Tangible and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets. \nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. The impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. We consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary, including by way of examples, a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and/or projected cash flows, significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete, our strategy and capital planning, and the economic environment in markets to be served. When determining future cash flows, and, if necessary, fair value, we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets. We consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies, and all other available information at the time the estimates are made. Those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate. There were no indicators of impairment or impairment charges recorded during 2024, 2023, or 2022. \nGoodwill.\nOur goodwill, relating to various business combinations, consisted of the following at December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nSteel Operations Segment\n​\n$\n 272,133\n​\n​\n​\nAluminum Operations Segment\n​\n​\n 14,000\n​\n​\n​\nMetals Recycling Operations Segment\n​\n​\n 189,413\n​\n​\n​\nSteel Fabrication Operations Segment \n​\n​\n 1,925\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n$\n 477,471\n​\n​\n​\nAt least once annually (as of October 1), or when indicators of impairment exist, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below the company’s operating segments. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We have the option to consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, we perform a quantitative test.\nWhen conducting a qualitative assessment, we consider the impact of several factors on the company overall and each reporting unit individually including the timing and results of prior quantitative tests performed, changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest and discount rates), industry and market conditions, recent and projected financial performance, the company’s competitive position and other factors.  Significant judgment is involved in evaluating the totality of all factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. \nWhen conducting a quantitative test, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows (income approach), and for some years by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies, using Level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under ASC 820. Key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method (income approach) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a risk-adjusted discount rate based on management’s best estimate of market participants’ after-tax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums. Key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year. We consider historical and anticipated future results, general \n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\neconomic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of reporting units are estimated. Those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.\nGoodwill acquired in past transactions is naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired asset. A deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. Additionally, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, we may recognize an impairment in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts. Accordingly, our qualitative assessments consider changes in interest rates and our quantitative tests include discount rate scenario analysis to evaluate the impact on estimated reporting unit fair values. \nOur fourth quarter 2024, 2023, and 2022 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges. During 2024, we performed a qualitative assessment and performed quantitative tests in 2023 and 2022.  Management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail the goodwill impairment test in the near term, given the results of our most recent qualitative assessment and the determined fair value of the reporting units with goodwill from our most recent quantitative test exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount. Changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill.\nIncome Taxes. \nWe are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. This requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. We also establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. A tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.\n​\n​\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7A.          QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate changes.

Our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand.\nOur risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and electrodes. Refer to Note 8. \nCommitments and Contingencies\n to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information.\n​\nIn our metals recycling, aluminum, and steel operations, we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous and ferrous metals. Our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin, within certain parameters, that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor. At December 31, 2024, we had a cumulative unrealized gain associated with these financial contracts of $13.1 million, substantially all of which have settlement dates in 2025. We believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated. \n​\n​\n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.          CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nPage\n​\n​\n​\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n​\n52\n​\n​\n​\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n (PCAOB ID \n42\n)\n​\n53\n​\n​\n​\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\n​\n56\n​\n​\n​\nConsolidated Statements of Income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024\n​\n57\n​\n​\n​\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024\n​\n58\n​\n​\n​\nConsolidated Statements of Equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024\n​\n59\n​\n​\n​\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024\n​\n60\n​\n​\n​\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n​\n61\n​\n​\n​\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Steel Dynamics, Inc. is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the company’s consolidated financial statements and for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a – 15(f) of the Exchange Act, for the company (including its consolidated subsidiaries). We maintain accounting and internal control systems which are intended to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, transactions are executed in accordance with management’s authorization, and accounting records are reliable for preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We are dedicated to ensuring that we maintain the high standards of financial accounting and reporting that we have established. Our culture demands integrity and an unyielding commitment to strong internal control practices and policies.\nInternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and provide reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not always prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The framework on which such evaluation was based upon is contained in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the “COSO criteria”). Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report.\n​\n​\n/s/ Mark D.

In our opinion, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\n​\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nFebruary 28, 2025\n​\n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n​\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Steel Dynamics, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\n​\n​\n​\nValuation of Goodwill\nDescription of\nthe Matter\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company’s goodwill was approximately $477 million. As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs an impairment test for goodwill at least annually or when indicators of impairment exist. The Company performed a qualitative assessment as of October 1, 2024, to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. \nAuditing management’s annual goodwill impairment test was complex and judgmental as management considers the impact of several factors on the Company overall and each reporting unit individually including assessing the qualitative factors to be considered in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment, changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest and discount rates), industry and market conditions, recent and projected financial performance, the Company’s competitive position and other factors. Significant judgment is involved in evaluating the totality of all factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value.\nHow We\nAddressed the\nMatter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment testing process, including controls over management’s review of the qualitative factors described above.\nTo test management’s conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceed their carrying amounts, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the reasonableness of the qualitative factors considered within the analyses, testing the evaluation of the qualitative factors and the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We evaluated management’s assessment of the qualitative factors for each reporting unit by comparing to current industry and economic trends, current and historical results and key business drivers for each reporting unit, comparing the Company’s share price trends to historical amounts, and other relevant factors, including considering consistency with evidence obtained in other parts of the audit and evaluating whether any contrary evidence exists. \n​\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n​\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1999.\n​\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nFebruary 28,

Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of the Business\nSteel Dynamics, Inc. (SDI), together with its subsidiaries (the company), is one of the largest and most diversified domestic steel producers and metals recycler, combined with a meaningful steel fabrication manufacturing platform. The company has \nfour\n reporting segments: steel operations, metals recycling operations, steel fabrication operations, and aluminum operations. Effective the fourth quarter 2024, results from an entity previously reported within the metals recycling operations segment were moved to the aluminum operations segment, consistent with a change in how the company’s chief operating decision maker manages the business. Segment information provided within this Form 10-K, including that within Note 12. \nSegment Information\n, has been recast for all prior periods consistent with the current reportable segment presentation. Approximately \n5\n% of the company’s workforce in \nfour\n locations is represented by collective bargaining agreements, and agreements affecting \n0.5\n% of the company’s employees at \none\n location expires during 2025.\nSteel Operations Segment\nSteel operations include the company’s electric arc furnace (EAF) steel mills, including Butler Flat Roll Division, Columbus Flat Roll Division, Southwest-Sinton Flat Roll Division, Structural and Rail Division, Engineered Bar Products Division, Roanoke Bar Division, and Steel of West Virginia, steel coating and processing operations at The Techs, Heartland Flat Roll Division, United Steel Supply (USS) – \n90\n% equity interest as of April 1, 2023, Vulcan Threaded Products, warehouse operations in Mexico, and SDI Biocarbon Solutions, a joint venture to construct and operate a biocarbon production facility, of which SDI has a \n75\n% equity interest. \nMetals Recycling Operations Segment\nMetals recycling operations include the company’s OmniSource ferrous and nonferrous processing, transportation, marketing, brokerage, and scrap management services primarily throughout the United States and in Central and Northern Mexico. \nSteel Fabrication Operations Segment\nSteel fabrication operations include the company’s New Millennium Building Systems joist and deck plants located throughout the United States, and in Northern Mexico. Revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of girders, steel joists and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry. \nAluminum Operations Segment\nAluminum operations include the recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill nearing completion of construction in Columbus, Mississippi, \ntwo\n satellite recycled aluminum slab centers in the southwest United States and Central Mexico, and an entity with aluminum operations, formerly included in the results of the metals recycling operations segment. The flat rolled products mill is a joint venture with Unity Aluminum, Inc. of which SDI has a \n94.4\n% equity interest. The aluminum flat rolled products mill and the Mexico and US recycled aluminum slab centers are expected to begin operations in mid to late 2025.\nOther\nOther operations consist of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of joint ventures and the company’s idled Minnesota ironmaking operations. Also included in “Other” are certain unallocated corporate accounts, such as the company’s senior unsecured credit facility, senior notes, certain other investments, and certain profit sharing expenses.\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 1. Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SDI, together with its wholly- and majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. Noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling owners' proportionate share in the equity, income, or losses of the company’s majority-owned or controlled consolidated subsidiaries. Redeemable noncontrolling interests related to USS (owned \n90\n% by SDI) are $\n60.0\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Redeemable noncontrolling interests related to Mesabi Nugget (owned \n86\n% by SDI) are $\n111.2\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nUse of Estimates\nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and accordingly, include amounts that require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the notes thereto. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill; allowances for credit losses for trade receivables, inventories and deferred income tax assets; unrecognized tax benefits; potential environmental liabilities; and litigation claims and settlements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn the steel, metals recycling, and aluminum operations segments, revenue is recognized at the point in time the performance obligation is satisfied, and control of the product is transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery, at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive, including any variable consideration. The variable consideration included in the company’s steel operations segment contracts, which is not constrained, includes estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience, and may include volume rebates which are recorded on an expected value basis. Revenue recognized is limited to the amount the company expects to receive. The company does not exercise significant judgments in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations or the transaction price. Shipment of products to customers is considered a fulfillment activity with amounts billed to customers included in sales and costs associated with such activities included in cost of goods sold.\nThe company’s steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenue over time at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive. Revenue is measured on an output method representing completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract. Revenue from fabrication of tons remaining on partially fabricated customer contracts as of a reporting date, and future revenue from yet to be fabricated customer contracts, has not been disclosed under the practical expedient in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), paragraph ASC 606-10-50-14 related to customer contracts with expected duration of one year or less. The company does not exercise significant judgments in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations or the transaction price. Shipment of products to customers, which occurs after control over the product has transferred to the customer and revenue is recognized, is considered a fulfillment activity with amounts billed to customers included in sales and costs associated with such activities included in cost of goods sold.\nPayments from customers are generally due within 30 days of invoicing, which generally occurs upon shipment of the products. Shipment for the steel fabrication operations segment generally occurs within 30 days of satisfaction of the performance obligation and revenue recognition. The company does not have financing components. Payments from customers have historically been within these terms, however, payments for non-U.S. sales may extend longer. \n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 1. Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nRefer to Note 12. \nSegment Information\n for disaggregated revenue by segment to external, external non-United States, and other segment customers.\nCredit Losses\nThe company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment of accounts receivable by customers. The company mitigates its exposure to credit risk, which it generally extends on an unsecured basis, by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action if necessary, such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable. The allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable is based on the company’s reasonable estimate of known credit risks and historical experience, adjusted for current and anticipated economic and other pertinent factors affecting the company’s customers, that may differ from historical experience. Customer accounts receivable are written off when all collection efforts have been exhausted and the amounts are deemed uncollectible. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the company reported $\n1,417.2\n million and $\n1,608.3\n million, respectively, of accounts receivable, net of allowances for credit losses of $\n7.7\n million and $\n8.5\n million, respectively. Changes in the allowance were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.\nCash and Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and equivalents include all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three \nmonths or less at the date of acquisition. Restricted cash is primarily funds held in escrow as required by various insurance and government organizations.  The balance of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows includes restricted cash of \n$\n5.5\n million at December 31, 2024, $\n5.6\n million at December 31, 2023, and $\n5.5\n million at December 31, 2022, and 2021, which is recorded in Other Assets (noncurrent) in the company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nShort-Term Investments\nShort-term investments include investments with maturity dates of longer than three months but less than one year when purchased. The company’s short-term investments are classified as trading securities. The short-term investments held as of December 31, 2024 consisted of commercial paper ($\n19.7\n million), US Treasuries ($\n113.1\n million), and certificates of deposit ($\n15.0\n million). Short-term investments held as of December 31, 2023 consisted of commercial paper ($\n146.2\n million), US Treasuries ($\n564.9\n million), and certificates of deposit ($\n10.1\n million). Interest income from invested cash and short-term investments was $\n90.1\n million, $\n111.9\n million, and $\n29.3\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and is recorded in other (income) expense, net as earned. \nInventories\nInventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for raw materials (including scrap and purchased steel substrate) and supplies, and on a first-in, first-out basis for other inventory. \nInventory consisted of the following at December 31 (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 2024\n​\n 2023\n​\n​\nRaw materials\n$\n1,323,920\n​\n$\n1,226,272\n​\n​\nSupplies\n​\n805,035\n​\n​\n711,653\n​\n​\nWork in progress\n​\n269,031\n​\n​\n296,932\n​\n​\nFinished goods\n​\n715,747\n​\n​\n659,775\n​\n​\nTotal inventories\n$\n3,113,733\n​\n$\n2,894,632\n​\n​\n63\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 1. Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost which includes capitalized interest on construction in progress amounts, and is reduced by proceeds received from certain state and local government grants and other capital cost reimbursements, except for assets acquired in acquisitions which are valued at fair value at the purchase date. The company assigns each fixed asset a useful life ranging from \n3\n to \n15 years\n for plant, machinery and equipment, and \n5\n to \n40 years\n for buildings and improvements.

Impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. The impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to its carrying amount. The company considers various factors and determines whether an impairment test is necessary, including by way of examples, a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and/or projected cash flows, significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete, the company’s strategy and capital planning, and the economic environment in markets to be served.  \nGoodwill\nThe company’s goodwill consisted of the following at December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nSteel Operations Segment\n​\n$\n \n272,133\n​\n​\n​\nAluminum Operations Segment\n​\n​\n \n14,000\n​\n​\n​\nMetals Recycling Operations Segment\n​\n​\n \n189,413\n​\n​\n​\nSteel Fabrication Operations Segment \n​\n​\n \n1,925\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n$\n \n477,471\n​\n​\n​\nIn the fourth quarter 2024, results from an entity previously included in the metals recycling operations segment were moved to the aluminum operations segment, which also resulted in $\n14\n million of \ngoodwill\n being reassigned to the aluminum operations segment based on a relative fair value allocation approach. Segment information for 2023 has been recast consistent with the current reportable segment presentation. Cumulative OmniSource goodwill impairment charges were $\n346.8\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n​\nImpairment of Goodwill\nAt least once annually (as of October 1), or when indicators of impairment exist, the company performs a goodwill impairment analysis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below the company’s operating segments. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the company recognizes an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The company has the option to consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. If elected to bypass the qualitative assessment or if indications of a potential impairment exist, the company performs a quantitative test.\n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 1. Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nWhen conducting a qualitative assessment, the company considers the impact of several factors on the company overall and each reporting unit individually including the timing and results of prior quantitative tests performed, changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit, macroeconomic conditions (including changes in interest and discount rates), industry and market conditions, recent and projected financial performance, the company’s competitive position and other factors.  When conducting a quantitative test, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows (income approach), and for some years by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies, using Level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under ASC 820, \nFair Value Measurement\n.  \n​\nNo\n impairment was identified during the company’s 2024, 2023 or 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis. During 2024, the company performed a qualitative assessment and performed quantitative tests in 2023 and 2022.\n​\nEquity-Based Compensation\nThe company has several stock-based employee compensation plans which are more fully described in Note 6. Equity-Based Incentive Plans. Compensation expense for restricted stock units, deferred stock units, restricted stock, stock appreciation awards, and performance awards is recorded over the vesting periods using the fair value as determined by the closing fair market value of the company’s common stock on the grant date, and with respect to performance awards, an estimate of probability of award achievement during the performance period. The company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Compensation expense for these stock-based employee compensation plans was \n$\n65.6\n million, \n$\n60.1\n million, and \n$\n69.2\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe company accounts for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes the weighted average dilutive effect of common share equivalents outstanding during the period applied to the company’s basic earnings per share. Common share equivalents represent potentially dilutive restricted stock units, deferred stock units, restricted stock, and performance awards, and are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect. There were \n269,000\n anti-dilutive common stock equivalents as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. There were \nno\n anti-dilutive common stock equivalents as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022.\n​\n66\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 1.

When advantageous, the company places its temporary cash with high credit quality financial institutions and companies and limits the amount of credit exposure from any one entity. The company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by customers. The company mitigates its exposure to credit risk, which it generally extends initially on an unsecured basis, by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action if necessary, such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe company routinely enters into forward exchange traded futures to manage price risk associated with nonferrous metal inventory, as well as purchases and sales of nonferrous (primarily aluminum and copper) and ferrous metals, to reduce exposure to commodity related price fluctuations. The company does not enter into these derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, are recognized as either an offset against the change in fair value of the hedged balance sheet item in the case of fair value hedges or as other comprehensive income in the case of cash flow hedges, until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings for fair value hedges. The company offsets fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under master netting agreements.\nIn the normal course of business, the company has derivative financial instruments in the form of forward contracts in various metallic commodities and those related to managing fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. At the time of acquiring these financial instruments, the company designates and assigns these instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities or anticipated transactions. When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished, or the anticipated transaction being hedged is no longer expected to occur, the company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated hedged financial instrument in earnings.\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 1. Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nThe fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments, along with required margin deposit amounts with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements, totaled $\n26.0\n million and $\n24.0\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are reflected in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Total gains and losses related to derivatives in fair value hedging relationships, as well as those not designated as hedging instruments, are recognized in costs of goods sold and were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, for which gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income, along with net amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income, were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. \n \n​\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 12. \nSegment Information\n.\nRecently Issued Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation, the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state, and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 is to be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. The company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09. \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nIncome Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n, requiring public entitles to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03.\nNote 2. Business Combinations and Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\nBusiness Combinations\nROCA\nThe company acquired \n100\n%\n of  ROCA ACERO, S.A. de C.V. (ROCA) on October 1, 2022. The acquisition of ROCA is part of the company’s North American raw material procurement strategy. ROCA is headquartered in Monterrey, Mexico, and operates ferrous and nonferrous scrap facilities strategically positioned near high-volume industrial scrap sources located throughout Central and Northern Mexico. The transaction was funded with available cash. Post\n-acquisition operating results are reflected in the company’s financial statements in the metals recycling operations segment.\n​\n68\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 2. Business Combinations and Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates (Continued)\nAluminum Dynamics\nThe company obtained a \n94.4\n% equity interest in a joint venture concurrently formed with Unity Aluminum, Inc. on July 29, 2022, for the construction and operation of a new state-of-the-art lower-carbon recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill. The transaction was funded with available cash. Operating results from and after July 29, 2022, are reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements in the aluminum operations segment. \n​\nUnited Steel Supply\nThe company purchased a \n75\n% equity interest in United Steel Supply, LLC on March 1, 2019. On April 1, 2022, the company purchased an additional \n12.5\n% equity interest in USS. On April 1, 2023, a noncontrolling member of USS exercised its option to require SDI to purchase its \n2.5\n% equity interest, increasing SDI’s ownership to \n90\n%. The remaining noncontrolling members have the option to require SDI to purchase the remaining \n10\n% equity interest of USS on or after February 28, 2025. The USS noncontrolling interest is therefore reflected in redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. \n​\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\nThe company purchased a \n45\n% minority equity interest in New Process Steel, L.P. (NPS) on January 31, 2022. NPS is a metals solutions and distribution supply-chain management company headquartered in Houston, Texas, with a focus toward growing its value-added manufacturing applications. On February 28, 2022, the company also purchased a minority equity interest in Aymium, a producer of renewable biocarbon products. As the company does not have power to control these entities, the company accounts for these investments using the equity method of accounting, which are recorded in Other Assets (noncurrent) in the company’s consolidated balance sheets with related activity recorded in Other (Income) Expense, net. Profits or losses from transactions with NPS are eliminated until realized by the majority equity interest owner.\n​\nNote 3.

Proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of the company’s \n2.800\n% senior notes due December 2024, working capital, capital expenditures, advances for or investments in the company’s subsidiaries, acquisitions, redemption and repayment of other outstanding indebtedness, and purchases of the company’s common stock. \n69\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 3. Long-Term Debt (Continued)\nSenior Credit Facility, due 2028\n​\nOn July 19, 2023, the company entered into an unsecured credit agreement comprised of a senior unsecured credit facility (Facility), which provides a $\n1.2\n billion unsecured Revolver, maturing July 2028. Subject to certain conditions, the company has the opportunity to increase the Facility size by $\n500.0\n million. The unsecured Facility is available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. The Facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to the company’s ability to incur indebtedness and permit liens on certain assets. The company’s ability to borrow funds within the terms of the unsecured Facility is dependent upon its continued compliance with financial and other covenants. At December 31, 2024, the company had $\n1.2\n billion of availability on the Facility, $\n9.3\n million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were \nno\n borrowings outstanding.\n​\nThe Facility pricing grid is adjusted quarterly and is based on either the company’s leverage of net debt (as defined in the Facility) to last-twelve-months (LTM) consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Facility (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash items as allowed in the Facility), or the company’s credit ratings. The minimum pricing is adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\nSOFR\n) plus \n1.000\n% and the maximum pricing is adjusted \nSOFR\n plus \n1.75\n%. In addition, the company is subject to an unused commitment fee of between \n0.11\n% and \n0.275\n% (based on either the leverage of net debt to LTM consolidated adjusted EBITDA, or the company’s credit ratings) which is applied to the unused portion of the Facility. \nThe financial covenants under the Facility state that the company must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than \n2.50\n:1.00. The company’s interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing its LTM consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by its LTM gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. In addition, a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than \n0.60\n:1.00 must be maintained. At December 31, 2024, the company’s interest coverage ratio and debt to capitalization ratio were \n21.68\n:1.00 and \n0.27\n:1.00, respectively. The company was, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024, and anticipates remaining in compliance during the next twelve months.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nThe company has \nseven\n different tranches of senior unsecured notes (Notes) outstanding. These Notes are in equal right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and are senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness.

Annually, the company evaluates the realizability of the net deferred tax assets for this controlled subsidiary.  In completing this evaluation, the company considers all available positive and negative evidence in order to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets is necessary.  Such evidence includes current operating results, historical results, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and expectations for future taxable income (exclusive of the reversal of temporary differences and carryforwards), as well as the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.

The company recognizes interest and penalties related to its tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the company recognized expense from the increase of interest expense and penalties of $\n710,000\n, $\n1,560,000\n, and $\n480,000\n, respectively, net of tax. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits in the table above, the company had $\n4.2\n million and $\n3.2\n million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n​\n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 4. Income Taxes (Continued)\nIt is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months in an amount ranging from \nzero\n to $\n12.0\n million, as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations and other federal and state income tax audits. The company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. The tax years 2021 through 2023 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and various state and local jurisdictions.\nNote 5. Shareholders’ Equity\nCash Dividends\nThe company declared cash dividends of $\n284.1\n million, or $\n1.84\n per common share, during 2024; $\n280.5\n million, or $\n1.70\n per common share, during 2023; and $\n245.3\n million, or $\n1.36\n per common share, during 2022. The company paid cash dividends of $\n282.6\n million, $\n271.3\n million, and $\n237.2\n million during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nTreasury Stock\nIn July 2021, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $\n1.0\n billion of the company’s common stock. This program was exhausted in April 2022. In February 2022, the board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to $\n1.25\n billion of the company’s common stock. This program was exhausted in November 2022. In November 2022, the board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to $\n1.5\n billion of the company’s common stock. This program was exhausted in November 2023. In November 2023, the board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to $\n1.5\n billion of the company’s common stock. Subsequent to December 31, 2024, in February 2025, the board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to $\n1.5\n billion of the company’s common stock. Under the share repurchase programs, purchases take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects, our cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions. The share repurchase programs do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended, extended, or terminated by us at any time. The share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date. The company repurchased \n9.4\n million shares for $\n1.2\n billion during 2024, \n13.4\n million shares for $\n1.5\n billion during 2023, and \n23.0\n million shares for $\n1.8\n billion during 2022 under the share repurchase programs. At December 31, 2024, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase $\n193.5\n million of additional shares under the November 2023 share repurchase program.\n​\nNote 6. Equity-Based Incentive Plans\n2023 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn May 2023, the company’s shareholders approved the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (2023 Plan), which supersedes the prior Amended and Restated 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2023 Plan is designed to attract, motivate, and retain qualified persons that are able to make important contributions to the company’s success. To accomplish these objectives, the 2023 Plan provides for awards of equity-based incentives through granting of restricted stock units (RSUs), deferred stock units (DSUs), stock appreciation rights (SARs), performance awards, such as the long-term incentive compensation program (LTIP), restricted stock awards (of which \nnone\n have been granted), stock options (of which \nnone\n have been granted), and unrestricted stock awards (of which \nnone\n have been granted). Under the 2023 Plan, \n9.0\n million shares of common stock were reserved for grant through December 31, 2033. The 2023 Plan uses a fungible share concept under which any awards that are not a full-value award, such as stock options and stock-settled SARs, will be counted against the share reserve as \none\n share for each share of common stock, and awards that are full-value awards, such as RSUs, DSUs, restricted and unrestricted stock awards, and performance awards, will be counted against the share reserve as \n2.09\n shares for each share of common stock. The SARs the company has granted to date can only be settled in cash, and thus, do not count against the share reserve. At December 31, 2024, there were \n6.2\n million shares still available for issuance.\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 6. Equity-Based Incentive Plans (Continued)\nSubstantially all of the company’s full-time, non-union, U.S. team members receive RSUs, which are granted annually in November at no cost to employees and vest \n100\n% over the shorter of \ntwo years\n from grant date or upon the recipient reaching retirement eligible age (\n59½ years\n). During 2024, 2023, and 2022, certain senior leadership of the company received RSUs in February which vest over a period of 2 to \n4 years\n. The stock is issued to employees upon vesting. The company satisfies RSUs with newly issued shares, and satisfies restricted and unrestricted stock awards, DSUs, and performance awards with treasury shares. In addition to the RSUs and LTIP awards granted during the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, presented below, the company awarded \n13,000\n, \n18,000\n and \n20,000\n DSUs in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The \n1,300\n SARs awards outstanding at December 31, 2024, for which no shares of common stock can be issued because the awards must be cash-settled upon exercise, have a weighted-average exercise price of $\n42.83\n.\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the company’s RSU activity and outstanding RSUs as of December 31, 2024, are presented below (dollars in thousands except grant date fair value):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nWeighted\n​\nAggregate \n​\n​\n​\n​\nNumber\n​\n Average Grant\n​\nIntrinsic\n​\nUnrecognized\n​\n of RSUs\n​\nDate Fair Value\n​\n Value \n​\n Compensation\nOutstanding RSUs as of January 1, 2022\n \n1,348,258\n​\n$\n43.82\n \n​\n$\n \n83,686\n​\n$\n \n39,657\nGranted \n \n481,926\n​\n​\n98.29\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nVested \n (\n786,622\n)\n​\n​\n37.38\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nForfeited \n (\n70,011\n)\n​\n​\n46.82\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAs of December 31, 2022\n \n973,551\n​\n$\n71.80\n \n​\n$\n \n94,765\n​\n$\n \n44,394\nGranted \n \n433,810\n​\n​\n108.95\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nVested \n (\n517,041\n)\n​\n​\n64.03\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nForfeited \n (\n40,829\n)\n​\n​\n78.70\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAs of December 31, 2023\n \n849,491\n​\n$\n99.13\n \n​\n$\n \n101,480\n​\n$\n \n43,073\nGranted \n \n374,370\n​\n​\n137.14\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nVested \n (\n394,675\n)\n​\n​\n94.28\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nForfeited \n (\n39,874\n)\n​\n​\n104.21\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024 (nonvested)\n \n789,312\n​\n$\n115.47\n \n​\n$\n \n90,037\n​\n$\n \n54,964\n​\n      The weighted average remaining life before vesting of the outstanding RSUs as of December 31, 2024, is \n1.6\n years.

The total shares withheld in 2024, 2023, and 2022 were approximately \n287,000\n, \n342,000\n, and \n249,000\n shares, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting dates as determined by the company’s closing stock price.\n​\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation Program (LTIP)\nThe company maintains an LTIP performance-based program directed toward key senior leadership of the company, as determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Awards are in shares of the company’s common stock using the stock price on the first day of the performance period to convert each key senior executive’s predetermined multiple of annual base salary. The performance period is generally \nthree years\n; however, transition awards can be issued with a shorter performance period. Performance is measured in terms of equal portions of \nfour\n growth and profitability measures, as compared to the same measures, similarly treated, of a pre-established group of steel sector competitors. Awards earned can range from \nzero\n to \n100\n% of the shares awarded, and award shares vest immediately once earned on the basis of performance.\n​\n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 6.

At times a portion of the bonus may be distributed in shares of the company’s stock, of which \none-third\n of the shares vest immediately and the remaining shares vest in equal annual installments over an additional \ntwo-year\n service-based vesting period requirement. At December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, \n1.3\n million, \n1.3\n million, and \n1.4\n million shares, respectively, under the 2018 Executive Plan remained available for grant. Pursuant to the 2018 Executive Plan, \n17,000\n, \n29,000\n, and \n26,000\n shares were awarded with a market value of $\n2.2\n million, $\n3.5\n million, and $\n3.2\n million for the 2024, 2023, and 2022 award years, respectively\n.\nNote 7. Fair Value Measurements\nAccounting standards provide a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value, sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. Levels within the hierarchy are defined as follows:\n●\nLevel 1—Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets;\n●\nLevel 2—Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets (other than those included in Level 1) which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\n●\nLevel 3—Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\n76\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 7.

Commitments and Contingencies\nThe company has entered into certain commitments with suppliers which are of a customary nature. Commitments have been entered into relating to future expected requirements for commodities such as electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and electrodes. Certain commitments contain provisions which require that the company “take or pay” for specified quantities at fixed prices without regard to actual usage for periods of generally up to \n5 years\n for physical commodity requirements and commodity transportation requirements, with some extending beyond, and for up to \n15 years\n for air products and \n27 years\n for water products. The company utilized such “take or pay” requirements during the past \nthree years\n under these contracts. The company believes that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process.\nThe company’s commitments for these agreements with “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending December 31 are as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2025\n​\n$\n \n358,976\n​\n​\n2026\n​\n​\n \n57,430\n​\n​\n2027\n​\n​\n \n37,483\n​\n​\n2028\n​\n​\n \n24,360\n​\n​\n2029\n​\n​\n \n18,698\n​\n​\nThereafter\n​\n​\n \n164,532\n​\n​\n​\n​\n$\n \n661,479\n​\n​\n​\n77\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 8. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)\nAt December 31, 2024, the company has outstanding commitments of $\n578.8\n million related to ongoing construction of property, plant, and equipment, most significantly the recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill and recycled aluminum slab facilities, as well as other steel operations expansion projects in 2025. The company’s commitments for operating leases are discussed in Note 11. \nLeases.\nThe company is involved in various litigation matters, including administrative and regulatory proceedings, that arise in the ordinary course of business, none of which are expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nNote 9. Transactions with Affiliated Companies\nThe company purchases and sells recycled and scrap metal, steel, and purchases transportation services with other smaller affiliated companies, including equity method investments. These transactions for the years ended December 31, are as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\n​\n2022\n​\n​\nSales \n$\n \n720,742\n​\n$\n \n680,004\n​\n$\n \n791,523\n​\n​\nAccounts receivable \n​\n \n54,230\n​\n​\n \n73,245\n​\n​\n \n79,769\n​\n​\nPurchases \n​\n \n188,906\n​\n​\n \n167,798\n​\n​\n \n127,860\n​\n​\nAccounts payable \n​\n \n7,267\n​\n​\n \n9,685\n​\n​\n \n9,934\n​\n​\n​\nNote 10. Retirement Plans\nThe company sponsors several 401(k) retirement savings and profit sharing plans (Plans) for eligible employees, which are considered “qualified plans” for federal income tax purposes. The company’s total expense for the Plans was \n$\n209.0\n million, \n$\n312.4\n million, and \n$\n466.9\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Profit sharing expense for eligible employees is \n8\n%\n of consolidated pretax income excluding noncontrolling interests and other items. The resulting profit sharing expense under the Plan was \n$\n165.2\n million, \n$\n264.6\n million, and \n$\n421.6\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively; of which up to \n$\n132.2\n million, \n$\n211.6\n million, and \n$\n337.2\n million,\n \nrespectively, was directed by the company’s board of directors to be contributed to the Plans (subject to total Plan contribution limitations), with the remaining amounts each year paid directly in cash to the Plans’ participants.\nNote 11. Leases\nThe company has operating leases relating principally to transportation and other equipment, and some real estate. The company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception, which generally occurs when the arrangement identifies a specific asset that the company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from use of the identified asset. Certain of the lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses (including fixed and index-based escalations), and options to \nextend\n or \nterminate\n the lease. For purposes of calculating operating lease obligations, the company’s lease terms include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise such option. The company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest the company could borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n​\n78\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 11.

Segment Information\nThe company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is the Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of the business through the following reportable segments: steel operations, metals recycling operations, steel fabrication operations, and aluminum operations. In the fourth quarter 2024, results from an entity previously reported within the metals recycling operations segment were moved to the aluminum operations segment, consistent with a change in how the CODM manages the business. Segment information provided within this Form 10-K has been recast for all prior periods presented consistent with the current reportable segment presentation. The segment operations are more fully described in Note 1. \nDescription of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n to the consolidated financial statements. \nThe CODM assesses segment performance and allocates resources primarily based on operating income. The CODM uses operating income to allocate operating and capital resources and assesses performance of each segment by comparing actual operating income results to historical and previously forecasted financial information. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with those described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
