Subscription and services revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023, due to an increase in stablecoin revenue .\n Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation . The Company reported a $350.5 million increase in rewards, interest and finance fee income, primarily driven by higher average crypto asset prices, mainly Bitcoin, Solana, and Etherum, and Bitcoin . The company's operating expenses were increased by $1.2 million to $2.3 million .\n Transaction expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023, due to: higher blockchain rewards fees, which rose generally in line with blockchain rewards revenue . There were no material changes to note within transaction reversal losses, blockchain transaction fees, or other expenses . Transaction expenses as a percentage of total revenue will vary depending on the composition of the Company’s total revenue .\n There was no change in overall transaction expense as a percentage of total revenue when comparing the periods presented . Technology and development expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023 . There were no material changes to note within amortization, depreciation, and impairment or other.commodest expenses driven by increased activity on our platform .\n An increase in marketing programs expenses was primarily due to $75.4 million higher digital advertising spend, and an increase in customer referral and other promotional initiatives . The company also increased USDC rewards payouts of $112.4 million due to higher reward rates offered to customers in an effort to enhance customer acquisition, retention, and platform engagement .\n The remaining variance in other was due to increases across various expenses, with no material changes to note .  $33.3 million in policy spend as we increased our crypto advocacy efforts;  $31.0 million in taxes, licenses, and fees primarily due to higher indirect taxes associated with the growth in revenue and the application of certain indirect tax rules .\n ucturing expense was $142.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, comprising separation pay, stock-based compensation expense, and other personnel costs related to the workforce reduction in January 2023 . There were no restructuring expenses for the  year ended Dec. 31, 2024 . Interest and other expenses were primarily due to remeasurement of the fair value of crypto assets held for investment, net .\n For the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023, the increase in provision for income taxes was primarily due to higher pretax income, partially offset by tax benefits from stock-based compensation . The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development introduced Pillar Two model rules imposing a 15% global minimum tax on companies such as ours .\n Adjusted EBITDA provides additional company-specific adjustments for certain items that may be included in income from operations but that we do not consider to be normal, recurring, operating expenses necessary to operate our business . The amounts of such expenses can vary significantly from period to period and may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations .\n We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other (income) expense, net, restructurings, and benefit from or provision for income taxes that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired .\n In the first quarter of 2024, we revised our definition of Adjusted EBITDA as follows and recast the prior period for comparability . Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our results . Other measures include impairment on assets still held and is a non-cash expense, net in total .\n The bined presentation is more streamlined and easily reconciled to our Consolidated Statements of Operations . The prior period comparative reconciliation has been updated to conform to the current period presentation (in thousands): Reformatted to revise our definition of Adjusted EBITDA to remove the adjustment for crypto asset borrowing costs on Prime Financing .\n Amount in 2023 excludes stock-based compensation expense recognized in relation to restructuring, which is included below in the restructuring line in this table .

USDC is a stablecoin redeemable on a one-to-one basis for U.S. dollars . While not accounted for as cash or cash equivalents, we treat our USDC holdings as a liquidity resource. USDC loaned represents loaned assets that do not meet derecognition criteria against our crypto asset borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets .\n In 2023, we repurchased $427.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding long-term debt securities for cash payments aggregating $303.5 million in 2023 . As of December 31, 2024, we held $4.3 billion in  annual pramount of  long term debt .\n This adjustment caused the carrying values of the crypto assets we already held at the time to reflect their fair values . This adjustment does not represent additional capital resources generated during 2024 . We primarily receive crypto assets held for operations as payments for transaction revenue, blockchain rewards, custodial fee revenue, and other subscriptions and services revenue . We may not be able to sell our crypto assets at reasonable prices or at all .\n We borrow crypto assets from eligible institutional customers . These borrowings generally have open-ended terms or have a term of less than one year . We were in compliance with all collateral requirements as of December 31, 2024 . We also hold additional customer Assets on Platform that we do not recognize in our Consolidated Balance Sheets .\n We do not use customer crypto assets as collateral for any loan, margin, rehypothecation, or other similar activities to which we or our affiliates are a party, without the customer’s consent .
