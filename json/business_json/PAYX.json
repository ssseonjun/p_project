What differentiates our PEO solutions from our ASO solutions is that we serve as a co-employer of our clients’ employees and assume the risks and rewards of certain workers’ compensation insurance and certain health insurance offerings. We are certified under the Small Business Efficiency Act to provide PEO solutions. We also provide insurance offerings which help business owners protect their bottom line from unforeseen costs, including cyberattacks and employee lawsuits.\n \n•\nInsurance solutions: \nOur licensed insurance agency, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., provides insurance through a variety of carriers, allowing employers to expand their employee benefit and corporate offerings at an affordable cost.

Additionally, clients can integrate their insurance plans with Paychex payroll processing for easy, accurate plan administration.\n \n \nSales and Marketing\n \nWe market and sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force based in the markets we serve. Our direct sales force includes field and inside sales representatives who specialize within our portfolio of solutions. Our sales representatives are also supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, and various other demand generation programs.\n \n \nIn addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we utilize other indirect sales channels such as our relationships with existing clients, certified public accountants (“CPAs”), benefit brokers, and banks for new client referrals. More than 50% of our payroll clients come from these referral sources. Our dedicated business development group drives sales through banking, national associations, and franchise channels. Complementing our direct sales, our Embedded HCM Solution partnerships efficiently extend our distribution while providing a modern, holistic solution to customers. We also utilize digital marketing to promote our solutions.\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nWe have a long-standing partnership with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business Solutions\n™ \nProgram. Our current partnership agreement with the AICPA is in place through September 2027. We also partner with numerous state CPA society organizations. We provide a free online portal, Paychex Partner Pro, designed to provide accountants quick access to critical data, reporting, and insights for their clients using Paychex Flex. This innovative portal transforms how CPAs manage their portfolios by providing a centralized hub for accessing client payroll and HR data, resolving issues, and identifying missing information, empowering them to operate with greater efficiency and proactivity in serving their clients.\n \nWe also have long-standing relationships with health insurance and retirement benefits brokers, including large national partners. We recently launched the Partner+ Program to foster broker relationships and drive mutual growth. We now have a broader suite of solutions to offer brokers, which can supplement their offerings to clients, and the Partner+ Program provides a structured framework designed to safeguard mutual clients from competing products. In addition, our Partner Portal provides brokers exclusive access to advanced HCM solutions, new revenue streams, and data-driven insights.\n \nOur corporate website is available at \nwww.paychex.com\n, and is a cost-efficient channel that serves as a source of leads and new sales, while complementing the efforts of our direct, indirect, and virtual sales forces. The website enables us to market to existing and prospective clients that want to learn more about our solutions and support, and offers information about our core business solutions: human resources, payroll, benefits, and insurance.\n \n \nPaychex also builds on its reputation as an expert in the HCM industry by providing educational resources to our clients. We provide free webinars, podcasts, white papers, and other information on our website to inform businesses on the impact of regulatory change as well as HR and business best practices. Paychex WORX and the Paycor HR Center for Excellence provide information on the latest trends, best practices, and industry benchmarks designed to drive business success.\n \nWe also track current regulatory issues that impact the business community and provide regulatory updates. We issue small business trend reports through our monthly Paychex Small Business Employment Watch.\n \nMarkets and Competition\n \nWe remain focused on servicing clients based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve. Census data indicates that in the U.S., there are over 6 million employer firms in our target markets.\n \nThe market for HCM solutions is highly competitive and fragmented. We have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national, international, regional, local, and online payroll providers. In addition to traditional payroll processing and HR solution providers, we compete with in-house payroll and HR systems and departments. We believe our solutions also compete with a variety of providers of HR services, such as retirement solutions companies, insurance companies, HR and benefits consulting firms, and national and regional PEOs.\n \nCompetition in the HCM industry is primarily based on the breadth of offerings, technology, ease of use, integration with third-party applications, service model, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas. Our leading-edge technology and mobile applications, combined with personalized support provided by industry professionals and our technology-enabled solution capabilities, differentiate us from our competitors.\n \nSoftware Maintenance and Development\n \nThe ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and HCM solutions to our clients. We are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintaining our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace. We continue to enhance our SaaS solutions and mobile applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience. Continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success.\n \nHuman Capital\n \nWe believe our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business is critical to our future success and growth. We strive to foster a workplace that encompasses belonging and engagement and the ability to attract, retain, and develop talented employees; and keep them safe. We have dedicated resources to ensure that our efforts in building and sustaining a safe and inclusive culture are realized.\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nFor detailed information regarding our human capital activities, we encourage investors to visit our Corporate Responsibility website page at https://www.paychex.com/corporate/corporate-responsibility. We have also made our Corporate Responsibility report available on our website. The information contained on our website and in our Corporate Responsibility report is not and should not be viewed as being incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\n \nOur Employees:\n As of May 31, 2025, we employed approximately 19,000 people, primarily in the U.S. and on a full-time basis. None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\n \n \nPaychex Culture\n: Our core cultural values (“Paychex Values”) are designed to guide decision making aligned to the expectations of clients, stockholders, regulators, employees, and the multiple communities in which we operate and to reflect our continuing commitment to belonging and engagement. The Paychex Values are:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrity\n\n\nAccountability\n\n\nInnovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartnership\n\n\nRespect\n\n\nService\n\n\n\n\n \nEach of these values guide our decision-making process and are critical to our ongoing success. All employees are required to verify their understanding and observance of these values during our annual “Right Way” training, review these values with management during periodic performance discussions, and are further encouraged to attend ongoing training during the year. Volunteer “Culture Champions” throughout the Company also help promote these values daily. We encourage employee feedback through our employee engagement surveys, as described below. This approach empowers our employees and allows us to make a positive impact in the communities we work and serve. As a result of our commitment to these principles, in 2025 we were recognized by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies. Paychex is one of only three companies to have achieved this recognition 17 times, doing so consecutively since 2012.\n \nTalent Acquisition and Development:\n We compete for talent along with our direct competitors and other companies in the geographic areas we serve. We invest significant resources to attract and retain top talent. Our Talent Acquisition team, in conjunction with certain third-party partners, has developed comprehensive processes to identify and recruit accomplished professionals.\n \n \nOnce hired, our world-class Training Department provides functional training for service specialists and sales associates and also offers personal training, professional development, and leadership-development programs. As a result of our efforts, we have been recognized as one of the top training organizations in the world by Training magazine. After four consecutive years ranking among the top ten, Paychex was inducted into the Training Hall of Fame in 2025.\n \nComprehensive Compensation and Benefits: \nWe are committed to providing a fair wage and a total rewards package that allows our employees to be their best in every area of their lives.\n \nWe regularly review employee salaries to ensure we are competitive in the industry and offer financial benefits such as a 401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, tuition assistance, scholarships for children of employees, and financial education. We are also committed to rewarding employees with a comprehensive, competitive benefits package, which includes medical, prescription, dental, and vision insurance, short- and long-term disability, employee assistance program, paid family leave, and a variety of well-being programs. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025 (“fiscal 2025”), compensation-related expenses accounted for approximately 55% of our total expenses.\n \n \nEmployee Well-being Initiatives: \nIn addition to providing a comprehensive compensation and benefits package, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for our employees. Healthier employees are at lower risk of injury from workplace related exposures, perform work more safely with lower rates of absenteeism, experience better job performance, and can live their lives more fully outside of work. Our well-being program is a robust program focusing on the physical, emotional, community, career, and financial health of our employees.\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nOur award-winning well-being initiatives offer a wide variety of services, tools, and resources that can help employees achieve their health goals using a holistic approach. In addition, we sponsor onsite health screenings, Red Cross blood donation events, flu vaccination clinics, vaping and tobacco cessation and weight management programs, meditation and yoga classes, and a variety of other programs. Our employees’ financial well-being is equally important, so we have developed programs for financial education and support. We maintain procedures for events such as fires, severe weather, medical emergencies, and active shooters, as well as other important information related to general workforce safety.\n \nIn recognizing the ever-growing diversity of our workplace, we annually celebrate Paychex Culture Day. This is an additional paid day off for employees to celebrate and recognize a holiday that is significant to them. This is just one of the many ways we celebrate our employees’ unique heritages, and it reflects our Company's commitment to our staff.\n \nEmployee Engagement\n: We regularly ask our employees to share their views on working at Paychex through company-wide engagement surveys. Facilitated internally by our Human Resources team, the survey methodology is periodically updated to reflect current trends and issues including company direction and strategy, inclusion, individual development, collaboration, and our Paychex Values. A third-party administers the survey to maintain confidentiality of responses. We use the survey responses to help inform management and assist in developing programs and policies that will maintain and promote Paychex Values.\n \nIntellectual Property\n \nWe own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Collectively, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us.\n \nSeasonality\n \nThere is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement solutions clients, and new worksite employees associated with our HR Outsourcing businesses tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many businesses prefer to start using our solutions at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to year-end bonus payments, additional year-end services, and the preparation and delivery of end-of year reporting requirements.\n \n \nAvailable Information\n \nWe are subject to the informational and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that includes our reports, proxy statements, and other information.\n \n \nOur corporate website, www.paychex.com, provides materials for investors and information about our solutions.

We incurred $14.9 million in debt financing fees, including structuring and commitment fees, which were capitalized as Prepaid expenses and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized as interest expense on a straight-line basis through the issuance date of our Corporate Bonds. The bridge loan commitment expired upon the issuance our Corporate Bonds. Refer to Note N of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on our long-term financing.\n \nInterest Rate Swaption Contracts: \nOn January 31, 2025, we executed three Swaption Contracts with JPM. The Swaption Contracts qualified as cash flow hedges, had an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, and were utilized to manage exposure to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates associated with the issuance of Corporate Bonds to fund our acquisition of Paycor. At inception, we recorded Swaption Contract assets related to paid premiums of $19.2 million.

Refer to Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on income taxes. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability.\n \n \nWe are a limited partner in five limited partnership arrangements to contribute a maximum of $37.0 million to venture capital funds. As of May 31, 2025, we have contributed $29.0 million of the total funding commitment. The timing of future contributions to be made to these venture capital funds cannot be specifically or reasonably determined. Our investments in these venture capital funds are not considered part of our ongoing operations, are accounted for under the equity method, and represented less than one percent of our total assets as of May 31, 2025.\n \nIn the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such commitment. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and non-officer fiduciaries of our pooled employer plan retirement offering, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us.\n \nWe currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and PEO employee health, medical, and workers' compensation benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and were not material as of May 31, 2025. We also maintain corporate insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retention through our captive insurance company.\n \nOperating, Investing, and Financing Cash Flow Activities\n \nPrimary sources of cash, restricted cash, and equivalents are through collections for services rendered to our customers and interest earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. Primary uses of cash include employee compensation and contractual obligations related to business operations, cash dividends paid, share repurchases, purchases of property and equipment, servicing our long term debt, and acquisitions.\n \nOur investment portfolio incorporates both corporate cash and funds held for clients. Interest rates, market conditions, and our variable cash flows are among several factors influencing our investment strategy directing the mix between long-term and VRDN AFS securities vs. short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents held in the portfolio. A portfolio strategy that favors larger balances held in restricted cash and cash equivalents may impact our investing activities due to the offsetting activity in the purchases and sales/maturities of AFS investments.\n \nOur cash flows include certain activities that are short-term in nature and have an impact on short-term cash flows due to timing of collection and settlement of obligations as follows:\n•\nPEO receivables and worksite-employee (\"WSE\") accrued compensation:\n PEO receivables and WSE accrued compensation fluctuate based on either/both: (1) the timing of the payroll cut-off date and the Company’s month-end close, and (2) the timing of when cash is collected from the customer, and it is remitted to either the WSE for wages earned or applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll taxes. PEO accounts receivable collections and compensation payments to WSEs and applicable tax or regulatory agencies are settled through our corporate cash and the fluctuations impact our operating activities.\n•\nClient fund obligations:\n Client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of when cash is collected from the clients and when it is remitted to employees of the clients utilizing employee payment services or applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. Fluctuations in client fund obligations impact financing activities.\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nSummarized cash operating, investing, and financing cash flow information is as follows for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n1,900.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n1,897.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n3.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(3,356.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(260.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(3,095.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by/(used in) financing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,293.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,874.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,167.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet change in cash, restricted cash, and equivalents\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n837.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n(237.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n1,075.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash dividends per common share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n4.02\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n3.65\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe changes in our cash flows for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 were primarily the result of the following key drivers:\n \nOperating Cash Flow Activities\n \nFiscal 2025\n•\nNet income attributable to the reasons discussed in the “Results of Operations” section of this Item 7; and\n•\nAn increase in accrued interest related to our Corporate Bonds; offset by\n•\nA net decrease in refunds owed to our PEO clients related to tax benefits allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.\n \nFiscal 2024\n•\nNet income attributable to the reasons discussed in the “Results of Operations” section of this Item 7;\n•\nNet changes in PEO assets and liabilities as a result of the timing of cash collected and the settlement of payroll taxes;\n•\nNet realized losses on the disposal of assets primarily due to our cost optimization initiatives; and\n•\nIncrease in income tax reserves related to unrecognized tax positions taken for years still subject to audit by regulatory bodies; offset by\n•\nDecrease in accrued corporate compensation primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation tied to performance measures and the timing of payroll payments at month-end.\n \nInvesting Cash Flow Activities\n \nFiscal 2025\n•\nCash used primarily for the acquisition of Paycor.

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.\n \nRevenue recognition:\n Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services as well as investment income earned on funds held for clients. Fees associated with services are recognized when control of the contracted services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such services. Our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Insurance Solutions revenues are recognized when commissions are earned on premiums billed and collected. Fees earned for the purchase of client's accounts receivable under non-recourse arrangements are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract. These fees are then recognized over the average collection period of 35 to 50 days for clients in the temporary staffing agency market and approximately 5 to 15 days for other clients. The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the delivery are included in cost of service revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\n \nWe receive advance payments for set-up fees from our clients. Advance payments received for certain of our service offerings for set-up fees are considered a material right. Therefore, we defer the revenue associated with these advance payments, recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected period to which the material right exists.\n \nPEO Solutions revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain pass-through costs billed and incurred, which include payroll wages, payroll taxes, including federal and state unemployment insurance, and certain health insurance benefit premiums, primarily costs related to our guaranteed cost benefit plans. Direct costs related to workers’ compensation and certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as cost of service revenue rather than as a reduction in service revenue.\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nInterest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services.\n \n \nAssets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts:\n We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new contracts and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. We do not incur incremental costs to obtain a contract renewal. We determined that certain sales commissions and bonuses, including related fringe benefits, meet the capitalization criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 340-40, “Other Assets and Deferred Costs: Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 340-40”). We also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. We determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. These capitalized costs to fulfill a contract principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered and enhance our ability to satisfy future performance obligations.\n \nThe assets related to both costs to obtain and costs to fulfill contracts with clients are capitalized and amortized using an accelerated method over an eight-year life to closely align with the pattern of client attrition over the estimated life of the client relationship. We regularly review our deferred costs for potential impairment and did not recognize an impairment loss during fiscal 2025 or 2024.\n \nPEO insurance reserves: \nAs part of our PEO solution, we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees. Workers’ compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies. Workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. These reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. In establishing the PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims. The determination of estimated ultimate losses by our independent actuary are based on accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. The estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon loss development factors, and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities, the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers’ compensation claims cost estimates.\n \nWith respect to our PEO health insurance, we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans or fully insured insurance arrangements where we retain risk. A reserve for insurance arrangements where we retain risk is established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with our service contract with the carrier. The claims liability includes estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims.\n \n \nEstimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and accepted actuarial methods and assumptions, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly with workers’ compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future. We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends. Adjustments to previously established reserves were not material for fiscal 2025 or 2024.\n \nGoodwill and other intangible assets:\n Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of a reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, a qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units. The qualitative assessment considered various financial, macroeconomic, industry, and reporting unit specific qualitative factors. Based on the results of our testing, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2025 or 2024. Subsequent to the latest review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the Company’s goodwill balance.\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nWe also test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for potential impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances change in a way that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We have determined that there is no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for fiscal 2025 or 2024 as a result of the qualitative analyses performed.\n \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets:\n Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. We have determined that there is no impairment of long-lived assets for fiscal 2025 or as of May 31, 2025.\n \nStock-based compensation costs:\n All stock-based awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. Volatility is estimated based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility. Expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model. We will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.\n \nThe fair value of time-based stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant. For grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents, the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period.\n \nThe fair value of performance-based stock awards that include a market condition is estimated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation requires various assumptions as inputs including the expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and the stock prices of the companies that comprise the designated peer group. Stock price volatility of the Company and the designated peer group is estimated based on historical volatility, using stock prices over a period equal to the measurement period of the award.\n \nWe estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified, with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.\n \nThe assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any material change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award. The Company periodically reassesses its assumptions as well as its choice of valuation models. The Company will reconsider use of its valuation models if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.\n \nRefer to Note F of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.\n \nBusiness combinations:\n  We account for acquisitions in accordance with the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), using the acquisition method of accounting. We allocate the purchase price consideration associated with its acquisitions to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition dates, with the excess recorded to goodwill. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in determining fair value of the following:\n \n•\nIntangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;\n•\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date;\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n•\nGoodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and\n•\nPre-existing liabilities and legal claims, and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable.\nOur assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from management and the management of the acquired companies. These assumptions and estimates are used to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and to allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination. Adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. We may engage  valuation specialists to assist in the fair value measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each acquisition.\nIncome taxes:\n We account for deferred taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of the exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of stock awards, we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\n \nWe maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements, we must conclude that tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below the more-likely-than-not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of the more-likely-than-not standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position. Refer to Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions.\n \nIte\nm 7A.\n \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n \nMarket Risk Factors\n \nChanges in interest rates and interest rate risk: \nFunds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and AFS securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of AFS securities. As a result of our investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our long-term AFS securities. We follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. A substantial portion of our portfolios are invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of AA or higher, and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities. We invest predominately in corporate bonds; municipal bonds; U.S. government agency securities; and VRDNs when available in the market. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We manage the AFS securities to a benchmark duration of two to three and one-quarter years.\n \nDuring fiscal 2025, our primary short-term investment vehicles were U.S. government agency discount notes and bank demand deposit accounts. We have no exposure to high-risk or non-liquid investments. We have insignificant exposure to European investments.\n \n \nDuring fiscal 2025, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investment portfolios was 3.7%, compared to 3.8% for fiscal 2024. When interest rates are falling, the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short- and long-term interest rate changes. During a falling interest rate environment, earnings will decrease from our short-term investments, and over time, will decrease from our longer-term AFS securities. Earnings from the AFS securities, which as of May 31, 2025 had an average duration of 2.2 years, would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates.\n \n \nThe amortized cost and fair value of AFS securities that had stated maturities as of May 31, 2025 are shown below by expected maturity.\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmortized\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFair\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\ncost\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nvalue\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaturity date:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue in one year or less\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n624.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n618.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue after one year through three years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,128.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,086.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue after three years through five years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n770.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n762.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue after five years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n285.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n287.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n3,809.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n3,755.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nVRDNs, when held by us, are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature.\n \nAs of May 31, 2025 and 2024, the Federal Funds rate was in the range of 4.25% to 4.50% and in the range of 5.25% to 5.50%, respectively. There continues to be uncertainty in the changing market and economic conditions, including the possibility of additional measures that could be taken by the U.S. President, the Federal Reserve and other government agencies related to the overall macroeconomic environment. We will continue to monitor the market and economic conditions.\n \n \nCalculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n \n•\ngovernmental action to address inflation and/or intervene to support financial markets;\n•\ndaily interest rate changes;\n•\nseasonal variations in investment balances;\n•\nactual duration of short-term and AFS securities;\n•\nthe proportion of taxable and tax-exempt investments;\n•\nchanges in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous; and\n•\nfinancial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates.\n \nSubject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 19 basis points. Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to earnings from a 25-basis-point change in short-term interest rates would be approximately $6.0 million to $6.5 million, after taxes, for a twelve-month period. Such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the Federal Funds rate.\n \nOur total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investments) averaged approximately $6.3 billion for fiscal 2025. Our anticipated allocation is approximately 45% invested in short-term securities and VRDNs with an average duration of less than 30 days, and 55% invested in available-for-sale securities with an average duration of two to three and one-quarter years.\n \nThe combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale securities reflected net unrealized losses of $53.6 million and $162.5 million as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Refer to Note H of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional disclosures on fair value measurements.\n \nDuring fiscal 2025, the net unrealized loss on our investment portfolios ranged from $41.8 million to $162.5 million. During fiscal 2024, the net unrealized loss on our investment portfolios ranged from $127.5 million to $259.6 million. The net unrealized loss on our investment portfolios was approximately $49.6 million as of July 8, 2025.\n \nAs of May 31, 2025 and 2024, we had $3.8 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, invested in AFS securities at fair value. The weighted-average yield-to-maturity was 3.3% and 3.0% as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The weighted-average yield-to-maturity excludes AFS securities tied to short-term interest rates, such as VRDNs, when held. Assuming a hypothetical decrease in longer-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of AFS securities as of May 31, 2025, would be in a range of approximately $20.0 million to $25.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity. These fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on our results of operations unless any declines in fair value are due to credit related concerns and an impairment loss recognized.\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nWe are also exposed to interest rate risk through the use of our credit facilities as outlined in Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Form 10-K. If interest rates were to increase, or we increase the frequency or amounts borrowed under these credit facilities, we could experience additional interest expense and a corresponding decrease in earnings.\n \nCredit risk: \nWe are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns and we believe that the investments we held as of May 31, 2025 were not impaired as a result of the previously discussed reasons. While $2.0 billion of our AFS securities had fair values that were below amortized cost, we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms, and that the gross unrealized losses of $68.0 million were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns. Most of the AFS securities in an unrealized loss position as of May 31, 2025 and 2024 held an AA rating or better. We do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity, and further believe that it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time. Our assessment that an investment is not impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns could change in the future due to new developments, including changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.\n \nWe have some credit risk exposure relating to our purchase of client accounts receivable under non-recourse arrangements. There is also credit risk exposure relating to our trade accounts receivable. These credit risk exposures are diversified among multiple client arrangements and all such arrangements are regularly reviewed for potential write-off. No single client is material in respect to total accounts receivable, service revenue, or results of operations.\n \n \nMarket risk: \nWe have an ongoing monitoring system for financial institutions we conduct business with and maintain cash balances at large well-capitalized (as defined by their regulators) financial institutions. We closely monitor market conditions and take appropriate measures, when necessary, to minimize potential risk exposure to our client’s and our cash and investment balances.\n \n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nIte\nm 8.\n \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nPage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\n38\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n (PCAOB ID \n238\n)\n\n\n39\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the Years Ended May 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023\n\n\n42\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2025 and 2024\n\n\n43\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the Years Ended May 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023\n\n\n44\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended May 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023\n\n\n45\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule II — Valuation and Qualifying Accounts for the Years Ended May 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023\n\n\n78\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nREPO\nRT ON MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF\nINTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement of Paychex, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (2013). Based on our assessment, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025.\n On April 14, 2025, we completed our acquisition of Paycor HCM, Inc. (“Paycor”). We are in the process of evaluating the existing controls and procedures of and integrating Paycor into our internal control over financial reporting. In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff guidance, permitting a company to exclude an acquired business from management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year in which the acquisition is completed, we have excluded Paycor from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025. Paycor represented approximately 8% of the Company’s total assets as of May 31, 2025 and approximately 2% of the Company’s revenues for the year ended May 31, 2025.\nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, is appointed by the Company’s Audit Committee. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025, and as a part of their integrated audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/s/  John B. Gibson\nJohn B. Gibson\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n \n\n\n/s/  Robert L. Schrader\nRobert L. Schrader\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting F\nirm\n \nTo the\n \nBoard of Directors and Stockholders of Paychex, Inc.\n \nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Paychex, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2025, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n \n \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the COSO.\n \nBasis for Opinions\n \nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report on Management's Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n \nAs described in the Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Paycor HCM, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2025, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2025. We have also excluded Paycor HCM, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Paycor HCM, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 8% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended May 31, 2025.\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n \nCritical Audit Matters\n \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n \nProfessional Employer Organization (PEO) Workers’ Compensation Insurance Reserves\n \nAs described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers workers’ compensation insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees. Workers’ compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies. Workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. As of May 31, 2025, the total liability for workers’ compensation insurance reserves is $236.8 million. In establishing the PEO workers' compensation insurance reserves, management uses an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims. The determination of estimated ultimate losses by the Company’s independent actuary are based on accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. The estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon loss development factors, and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities, the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends.\n \n \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s significant assumptions and actuarial estimates related to the loss development factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves, including controls over the development of management’s assumptions and actuarial estimates related to the loss development factors. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in management’s estimate of the PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (a) developing an independent estimate of the PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves and comparing the independent estimate to management’s estimate and (b) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s model and the reasonableness of management’s assumptions and actuarial estimates related to the loss development factors.\n \nAcquisition of Paycor HCM, Inc. – Valuation of Customer Relationships\nAs described in Note D to the consolidated financial statements, on April 14, 2025, the Company completed its acquisition of Paycor for total purchase consideration of $4.1 billion. The acquired intangible assets included $1.12 billion of customer relationships. The fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset was estimated by management using a multi-period excess earnings method. Management’s cash flow projections for the acquired Paycor customer relationships reflected significant judgments and assumptions including the revenue growth rate, customer attrition rate, and discount rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of customer relationships recorded in connection with the acquisition of Paycor is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the acquired customer relationships; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rate, customer attrition rate, and discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the acquired customer relationships. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the acquired customer relationships; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method used by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings method; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the revenue growth rate, customer attrition rate, and discount rate. Evaluating management’s assumption related to the revenue growth rate involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the Paycor business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method and (ii) the reasonableness of the customer attrition rate and discount rate assumptions.\n \n \n \n \n \n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFairport, New York\nJuly 11, 2025\n \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013.\n

Accounting Policies\n \nDescription of business:\n Paychex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Paychex”) is an industry-leading human capital management (“HCM”) company delivering a full suite of technology and advisory solutions in human resources (“HR”), employee benefit solutions, insurance and payroll for clients and their employees in the United States (“U.S.”) and parts of Europe. The Company also has operations in India.\n \nPaychex, a Delaware corporation formed i\nn 1979, reports as a \nsingle\n segment. \nRefer to Note R of this Item 8 for further discussion of the Company’s segment reporting for each of the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025 (“fiscal 2025”), May 31, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”), and May 31, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”) and as of May 31, 2025 and 2024.\n \nThe Company offers a full range of integrated HCM solutions covering the employee life cycle for businesses and their employees. Clients may choose from a breadth of solutions that also allow integration with some of the most popular HR, accounting, point-of-sale, and productivity applications on the market today. Paychex’s offerings often leverage the information gathered in its base payroll processing service, allowing the Company to provide comprehensive outsourcing services covering the HCM spectrum.\n \nPaychex supports its clients through its proprietary, robust Paychex Flex\n®\n platform, Paycor and the Company’s SurePayroll\n®\n SaaS-based solutions. Both solutions allow users to process payroll when they want, how they want, and on any type of device (desktop, tablet, and mobile phone). Paychex’s larger clients generally have more complex payroll and employee benefit needs and can opt for an integrated suite of HCM solutions, which allows them to choose the service and software solutions that will meet the needs of their businesses.\n \n \nTotal revenue is comprised of service revenue and interest on funds held for clients. Service revenue is comprised primarily of the fees earned on the portfolio of HCM services, which include payroll processing, complementary HR management and administration services, professional employer organization (“PEO”) solutions, and insurance agency commissions. Refer to Note B of this Item 8 for further discussion of the Company’s service revenue.\n \n \nBasis of presentation:\n The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain disclosures are reported as zero balances due to rounding.\n \n \nReclassifications:\n Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported consolidated earnings.\n \nCash and cash equivalents:\n Cash and cash equivalents consist of available cash, money market securities, and other investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents include funds collected from the Company’s PEO clients for the payment of worksite employee payrolls and associated payroll taxes. \n$\n179.8\n million\n and \n$\n171.7\n million\n collected from PEO clients are included in cash and cash equivalents on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2025 and 2024\n, respectively.\n \nRestricted cash and restricted cash equivalents:\n Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are recorded at fair value, and consist of cash and cash equivalents, primarily money market securities, included in funds held for clients and cash that is restricted in use to secure commitments for certain workers’ compensation insurance policies.\n \nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses:\n \nAccounts receivable balances are shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance for credit losses as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade receivables\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n205.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n141.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchased receivables\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,151.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n939.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal accounts receivable, gross\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,356.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,080.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess:  Allowance for credit losses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n26.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n1,330.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n1,059.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \n Trade receivables are for services provided to clients in the normal course of business and purchased receivables are acquired from the Company's clients under non-recourse arrangements.\n \n \nThe Company is exposed to credit losses through the sale of its solutions and support services, payment of client obligations, and collection of purchased receivables. To mitigate this credit risk, the Company has multiple programs in place to assess and continuously monitor each client’s ability to pay for these solutions and support services. Credit monitoring programs include, but are not limited to, new client credit reviews, establishing appropriate credit limits, monitoring of credit distressed clients, and early electronic wire and collection procedures. The Company also considers contract terms and conditions, client business type or strategy and may require collateralized asset support or prepayment to mitigate credit risk.\n \nAccounts receivable are written off and charged against the allowance for credit losses when the Company has exhausted all collection efforts without success. The Company estimates its allowance for credit losses based on historical loss activity adjusted for current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecast factors, when applicable.\n \n \nAllowance for credit losses activity related to accounts receivables are as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance, beginning of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n21.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n20.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n18.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for credit losses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite-offs and recoveries\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n19.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n19.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n15.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance, end of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n26.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n21.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n20.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNo\n single client had a material impact on total accounts receivable as of \nMay 31, 2025 or 2024\n. \nNo\n single client had a material impact on service revenue or results of operations for the fiscal years ended \nMay 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023\n.\n \n \nPEO unbilled receivables, net of advance collections:\n The Company recognizes a liability for worksite employee gross wages and related payroll tax liabilities at the end of the period in which the worksite employee performs work, and where it assumes, under applicable federal and state regulations, the obligation for the payment of payroll and payroll tax liabilities. The estimated payroll and payroll tax liabilities are recorded in accrued worksite employee compensation and related items on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated unbilled receivables, including estimated revenues, offset by advance collections from clients, are recorded as PEO unbilled receivables, net of advance collections on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of May 31, 2025 and 2024, advance collections were \n$\n1.8\n million\n and \n$\n0.7\n million\n, respectively.\n \nFunds held for clients and corporate investments:\n Marketable securities included in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist primarily of securities classified as AFS and are recorded at fair value obtained from an independent pricing service. The funds held for clients portfolio also includes cash and cash equivalents such as money market securities. Unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, are reported as other comprehensive income or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of AFS securities are determined by specific identification of the cost basis of each security. On the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, realized gains and losses from the funds held for clients portfolio and corporate investments portfolio are included in interest on funds held for clients and other income/(expense), net, respectively.\n \nConcentrations:\n Substantially all the Company’s deposited cash is maintained at large well-capitalized (as defined by their regulators) financial institutions. These deposits may exceed the amount of any insurance provided. All the Company’s deliverable securities are held in custody with certain of the aforementioned financial institutions, for which that institution bears the risk of custodial loss. Non-deliverable securities are primarily time deposits and money market funds.\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation:\n Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of property and equipment using the straight-line method. \nThe estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are generally as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciable life\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuildings and improvements\n\n\n \n\n\n \n10\n to \n35\n years or the remaining life, whichever is shorter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData processing equipment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n3\n to \n5\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurniture, fixtures, and equipment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n2\n to \n7\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeasehold improvements\n\n\n \n\n\n \n10\n years or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\n \n\n\n \n3\n to \n12\n years\n\n\n\n\n \n \nNormal and recurring repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. The Company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.\n \nSoftware development and enhancements:\n Expenditures for software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, which are generally \n3\n to \n5\n years. Software developed as part of the Company’s main processing platform is depreciated over \n12\n years. For software developed for internal use, certain costs are capitalized, including external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining the software, and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The carrying value of software and development costs is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.\n \nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization:\n Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of a reporting unit. The Company performs its annual impairment testing in its fiscal fourth quarter. During fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, a qualitative analysis was performed on all reporting units to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below their carrying values. During fiscal 2023\n, a qualitative assessment was performed for the Company's Paychex, Inc., excluding Purchased Receivables, reporting unit, and a quantitative assessment was performed on the Purchased Receivable reporting unit. The qualitative assessment considered various financial, macroeconomic, industry, and reporting unit specific qualitative factors. Based on the results of the Company’s testing, \nno\n impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal \n2025, fiscal 2024, or fiscal 2023. Subsequent to the latest review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the Company’s goodwill balance.\n \nIntangible assets are reported net of accumulated amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization is based on the estimated useful lives of asset using either an accelerated method or straight-line method. \nThe estimated useful lives of amortizable assets are generally as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n\n\n \n\n\nAmortizable life\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClient lists\n\n\n \n\n\n \n3\n to \n12\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquired developed software\n\n\n \n\n\n \n5\n to \n7\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther intangibles:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinite-lived trade names and trademarks\n\n\n \n\n\n \n3\n to \n15\n years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming rights\n\n\n \n\n\n \nOver remaining term of underlying agreement\n\n\n\n\n \nIn addition, the Company has intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, which are tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company has determined, using qualitative assessments, there is \nno\n impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for fiscal \n2025, fiscal 2024, or fiscal 2023\n.\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets:\n Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives and operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company has determined that there was \nno\n impairment of long-lived assets for fiscal \n2025, fiscal 2024, or fiscal 2023\n.\n \n \nDerivative Instruments: \n At inception, a derivative asset is recorded for the fair value of the premiums paid. Changes to the fair value of these cash flow hedges are temporarily reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified to earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. The Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of the related underlying exposure. Interest rate swaption contracts (“Swaption Contracts”), qualifying as cash flow hedges of interest payments, were used to hedge a portion of the Company's long-term fixed rate debt in fiscal 2025. Refer to Note M Short-term Financing for additional information on the Company's Swaption Contracts.\n \nForeign Currency:\n The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period. The resulting non-cash foreign currency translation adjustments, representing unrealized gains or losses, are included in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax. The Company did \nno\nt have any material realized gains or losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions during fiscal \n2025, fiscal 2024, or fiscal 2023\n.\n \n \nRevenue recognition:\n Revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services as well as investment income earned on funds held for clients. Fees associated with services are recognized when control of the contracted services is transferred to the Company's clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for such services. The Company’s service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Insurance Solutions revenues are recognized when commissions are earned on premiums billed and collected. \nFees earned for the purchase of client's accounts receivable under non-recourse arrangements are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract. These fees are then recognized over the average collection period of \n35\n to \n50\n days for clients in the temporary staffing agency market and approximately \n5\n to \n15\n days for other clients.\n The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for the delivery are included in cost of service revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\n \nThe Company receives advance payments for set-up fees from its clients. Advance payments received for certain service offerings for set-up fees are considered a material right. Therefore, the Company defers the revenue associated with these advance payments, recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected period to which the material right exists.\n \n \nPEO Solutions revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain pass-through costs billed and incurred, which include payroll wages, payroll taxes, including federal and state unemployment insurance, and certain health insurance benefit premiums, primarily costs related to the Company’s guaranteed cost benefit plans. Direct costs related to workers’ compensation and certain benefit plans where the Company retains risk are recognized as cost of service revenue rather than as a reduction in service revenue. Refer to Note B of this Item 8 for further discussion of the Company's PEO pass-through costs.\n \nInterest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration and employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services.\n \n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nAssets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts:\n The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new contracts and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company does not incur incremental costs to obtain a contract renewal. The Company determined that certain sales commissions and bonuses, including related fringe benefits, meet the capitalization criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 340-40, “Other Assets and Deferred Costs: Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 340-40”). The Company also recognizes an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. The Company has determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. These capitalized costs to fulfill a contract principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered and enhance the Company’s ability to satisfy future performance obligations.\n \n \nThe assets related to both costs to obtain and costs to fulfill contracts with clients are capitalized and amortized using an accelerated method over an eight-year life to closely align with the pattern of client attrition over the estimated life of the client relationship. The Company regularly reviews its deferred costs for potential impairment and did \nno\nt recognize an impairment loss during fiscal \n2025, fiscal 2024, or fiscal 2023\n.\n \nCost of service revenue:\n The Company’s costs and expenses applicable to total service revenue represent direct costs associated with providing HR, payroll, benefits, and insurance services. This includes labor-related costs, direct costs related to certain PEO solutions, postage and delivery costs, facility costs, professional services, and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, including internally developed software.\n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses:\n The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses represent labor-related costs, including amortization of deferred sales commissions and bonuses, corporate asset depreciation and amortization, marketing, and other general and administrative expenses incurred by the Company.\n \nPEO insurance reserves: \nAs part of its PEO solution, the Company offers workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees. Workers’ compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies. Workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits. These reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. In establishing the PEO workers’ compensation insurance reserves, the Company uses an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims. The determination of estimated ultimate losses by the Company’s independent actuary are based on accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. The estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon loss development factors, and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities, the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into the Company's workers’ compensation claims cost estimates. For fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024\n, the Company has an aggregate maximum liability of $\n1.0\n million for claims exceeding $\n1.0\n million, and once met, the maximum individual claims liability is $\n1.0\n million.\n \n \nAs of May 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company had recorded current liabilities of \n$\n80.4\n million\n and \n$\n74.1\n million\n, respectively, and long-term liabilities of \n$\n156.4\n million\n and \n$\n144.5\n million\n, respectively, on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers’ compensation insurance reserves. The amounts were recorded in the other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities sections, respectively, of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \nWith respect to PEO health insurance, the Company offers various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans or fully insured insurance arrangements where the Company retains risk. A reserve for insurance arrangements where the Company retains risk is established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with the Company’s service contract with the carrier. The claims reserve includes estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. The Company’s maximum individual claims liability was $\n0.5\n million under its policies durin\ng both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. Amounts accrued related to the health insurance and dental and vision plan reserves were \n$\n48.2\n million\n and \n$\n50.6\n million\n as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These amounts are included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \n \n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nEstimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. These reserves are subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly with workers’ compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could be significant, reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends. Adjustments to previously established reserves were not material for fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, or fiscal 2023\n.\n \nLeases:\n The Company accounts for its leases under ASC Topic 842, \"Leases\". At contract inception, the Company determines if the new contractual arrangement is a lease or contains a leasing arrangement. If a contract contains a lease with a term greater than one year, the Company evaluates whether it should be classified as an operating or a finance lease. Currently, all the Company’s leases have been classified as operating leases. Upon modification of a contract, the Company will reassess to determine if a contract is or contains a leasing arrangement.\n \nThe Company records lease liabilities based on the future estimated cash payments discounted over the lease term, defined as the non-cancellable time period of the lease, together with all the following:\n \n•\nperiods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the extension option; and\n•\nperiods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option.\n \nLeases may also include options to terminate the arrangement or options to purchase the underlying lease property. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. Lease components provide the Company with the right to use an identified asset, which consist of the Company’s real estate properties and office equipment. Non-lease components consist primarily of maintenance services.\n \nAs an implicit discount rate is typically not readily determinable in the Company’s lease agreements, the Company uses its estimated secured incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using a portfolio approach utilizing publicly available information related to our unsecured borrowing rates. For certain leases with original terms of 12 months or less, the Company recognizes lease expense as incurred and does not recognize any lease liabilities. Short-term and long-term portions of operating lease liabilities are classified as other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \nAn ROU asset is measured as the amount of the lease liability with adjustments, if applicable, for lease incentives, initial direct costs incurred by the Company, and lease prepayments made prior to or at lease commencement. ROU assets are classified as operating lease ROU assets, net of accumulated amortization, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company evaluates the carrying value of ROU assets if there are indicators of potential impairment and performs the analysis concurrent with the review of the recoverability of the related asset group. If the carrying value of the asset group is determined to not be fully recoverable and is in excess of its estimated fair value, the Company will record an impairment loss in its Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The Company did \nno\nt recognize an impairment loss during fiscal \n2025, fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\n \nFixed lease expense payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time, and are often due to changes in an external market rate or the value of an index (e.g. Consumer Price Index). Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\n \nStock-based compensation costs:\n All stock-based awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. For stock options, the Company estimates the fair value of grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including the expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. Volatility is estimated based on a combination of historical volatility, using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life, and implied market volatility. Expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior.\n \n \n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nThe fair value of time-based stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant. For grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents, the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period.\n \nThe fair value of performance-based stock awards that include a market condition is estimated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation requires various assumptions as inputs including the expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and the stock prices of the companies that comprise the designated peer group. Stock price volatility of the Company and the designated peer group is estimated based on historical volatility, using stock prices over a period equal to the measurement period of the award.\n \nThe Company’s policy is to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. The assumptions for forfeitures are determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified, with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.\n \nThe assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any material change in one or more of these assumptions could have an impact on the estimated fair value of a future award. The Company periodically reassesses its assumptions as well as its choice of valuation models. The Company will reconsider use of its valuation models if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.\n \nRefer to Note F of this Item 8 for further discussion of the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.\n \nIncome taxes:\n The Company accounts for deferred taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse.\n \n \nThe Company also maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in its consolidated financial statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements, the Company must conclude that tax positions will be more-likely-than-not to be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the amount the Company expects to realize after examination by taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below the more-likely-than-not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of the more-likely-than-not standard could materially impact the Company’s results of operations or financial position. Refer to Note L of this Item 8 for further discussion of the Company’s reserve for uncertain tax positions.\n \nBusiness combinations:\n  The Company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company allocates the purchase price consideration associated with its acquisitions to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition dates, with the excess recorded to goodwill. This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in determining fair value of the following:\n \n•\nIntangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;\n•\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date;\n•\nGoodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and\n•\nPre-existing liabilities and legal claims, and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable.\nThe \nCompany's assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. These assumptions and estimates are used to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and to allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination. Adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded during the measurement\n \n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nperiod, \nwhich may be up to one year from the acquisition date, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. The Company may engage a valuation specialist to assist in the fair value measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each acquisition.\nUse of estimates:\n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates.\n \nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements: \nEffective for the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2025, the Company \nadopted\n Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. \n2023-07\n “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The requirements of this ASU are disclosure-related and did \nno\nt have an impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Refer to Note R of this Item 8 for further discussion of the Company’s segment reporting.\n \nRecently issued accounting pronouncements: \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This ASU updates income tax disclosure requirements primarily by requiring specific categories and greater disaggregation within the rate reconciliation and disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and is applicable to the Company’s fiscal year beginning June 1, 2025, with early application permitted. The transition method is prospective with the retrospective method permitted. The requirements of this ASU are disclosure-related and will not have an impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its income tax disclosures.\n \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03 “Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” ASU 2024-03 as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic requires public business entities to disclose, for interim and annual reporting periods, additional information about certain income statement expense categories. The requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Entities are permitted to apply either the prospective or retrospective transition methods. This ASU is applicable to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2028, and subsequent interim periods, with early application permitted. The requirements of this ASU are disclosure-related and will not have an impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its disclosures.\n \nNote B — Service Revenue\n \nService revenue is primarily attributable to fees for providing services to the Company’s clients and is recognized when control of the contracted services is transferred to its clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for such services. Insurance Solutions revenue is commissions earned on premiums collected and remitted to insurance carriers. The Company’s contracts generally do not contain specified contract periods and may be terminated by either party with \n30\n-days notice of termination. Sales and other applicable non-payroll related taxes are excluded from service revenue.\n \nBased upon similar operational and economic characteristics, the Company’s service revenue is disaggregated by Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions as reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The Company believes these revenue categories depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\n \nManagement Solutions Revenue\n \nManagement Solutions revenue is primarily derived from the Company’s integrated HCM and HR outsourcing solutions. Clients can select services on an á la carte basis or as part of various solution bundles. The Company’s offerings often leverage the information gathered in its base payroll processing service, allowing it to provide comprehensive outsourcing services covering the HCM spectrum. Management Solutions revenue is generally recognized over time as services are performed and the customer simultaneously receives and controls the benefits from these services.\n \nRevenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is also included in Management Solutions revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Delivery service revenue is recognized at a point in time following the delivery of payroll checks, reports, quarter-end packages, and tax returns to the Company’s clients.\n \n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nPEO and Insurance Solutions Revenue\n \nPEO solutions are sold through the Company’s registered and licensed subsidiaries and offer businesses HCM and HR outsourcing solutions. The Company serves as a co-employer of its clients’ employees, offers health insurance coverage to client employees, and assumes the risks and rewards of workers’ compensation insurance and certain health insurance offerings. PEO Solutions revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed and the customer simultaneously receives and controls the benefits from these services. PEO Solutions revenue is reported net of certain pass-through costs billed and incurred, which include payroll wages, payroll taxes, including federal and state unemployment insurance, and health insurance premiums on guaranteed cost benefit plans. For workers’ compensation and health insurance plans where the Company retains risk, revenues and costs are recorded on a gross basis.\n \nPEO pass-through costs netted within the PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue are as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayroll wages and payroll taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n29,280.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n27,381.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n26,025.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nState unemployment insurance (included in payroll wages and payroll taxes)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n167.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n151.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n138.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuaranteed cost benefit plans\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n681.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n660.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n656.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nInsurance solutions are sold through the Company’s licensed insurance agency, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., which provides insurance through a variety of carriers, allowing companies to expand their employee benefit offerings at an affordable cost. Insurance offerings include property and casualty coverage such as workers’ compensation, business-owner policies, commercial auto, cybersecurity, and health and benefits coverage, including health, dental, vision, and life. Insurance Solutions revenue reflects commissions earned on remitted insurance services premiums billed and is recognized over time as services are performed and the customer simultaneously receives and controls the benefits from these services.\n \nContract Balances\n \nThe timing of revenue recognition for Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions is consistent with the invoicing of clients as they both occur during the respective client payroll period for which the services are provided. Therefore, the Company does not recognize a contract asset or liability resulting from the timing of revenue recognition and invoicing.\n \nPayments received for certain of the Company’s service offerings for set-up fees are considered a material right. Therefore, \nthe Company defers revenue associated with these performance obligations, which exceed one year, and subsequently recognizes them as future services are provided, over approximately \ntwo years\n to \nfour years\n.\n \nChanges in deferred revenue related to material rights that exceed one year were as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance, beginning of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n74.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n62.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred revenue acquired\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferral of revenue\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognition of unearned revenue\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n40.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n33.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance, end of period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n92.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n74.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nDeferred revenue related to material rights is reported in the deferred revenue and other long-term liabilities line items on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

This guidance requires disclosure of consideration transferred, including any contingent consideration, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed to be measured at their fair values as of the acquisition date. This guidance further provides that: (1) acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred, (2) restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and (3) changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. ASC 805 requires that any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles and liabilities assumed, be recognized as goodwill.\n \nPaycor HCM, Inc.\nOn April 14, 2025, the Company completed its acquisition of Paycor HCM, Inc. (“Paycor”) for total purchase consideration of approximately $\n4.1\n billion, of which $\n4.06\n billion was paid in cash and $\n25.1\n million was paid in the form of replacement awards. To finance the purchase consideration, Paychex issued a $\n4.2\n billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate corporate bonds. Refer to Note N for further details on the issued fixed rate corporate bonds. Paycor is a leading Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) provider of HCM solutions for\n small and medium-sized businesses across all 50 states within the U.S.\n \nEach unvested award of time-based restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\") granted under the Paycor 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan held by employees at the Director and above level was replaced with either Paychex RSUs or Paychex RSAs subject to the original vesting conditions. These replaced awards represent $\n15.9\n million of the $\n25.1\n million of fair value attributable to pre-combination services. Refer to Note F for further details on the replaced RSUs and RSAs. For unvested RSUs held by employees below the level of Director or each unvested phantom award held by Serbia-based Paycor employees at any level, these awards were converted into a cash award for the right to receive $\n22.50\n in cash per share, subject to the original vesting conditions. These cash awards represent $\n9.2\n million of the $\n25.1\n million of fair value attributable to pre-combination services.\nThe amount of Paycor revenue and net loss included in the Company’s condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from the acquisition date through May 31, 2025, was $\n92.5\n million and $\n75.9\n million, respectively.  Paycor's financial results include acquisition-related costs of $\n84.5\n million, net of tax. Refer to Note R for additional discussion on these acquisition-related costs.\nAcquisition related costs consist of miscellaneous professional service fees and expenses for our recent acquisitions. The Company recognized \n$\n49.2\n million of acquisition-related costs that were expensed in the current fiscal year. These costs are shown as part of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe transaction aims to enhance the Company’s capabilities in the upmarket segment and expand its suite of AI-driven HCM solutions.\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nPurchase Consideration and Allocation\nThe Company accounted for the Paycor acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Paycor were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate and require a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties. Third-party valuation specialists were engaged to assist in the valuation of certain assets and liabilities. The purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date is subject to change as additional information about the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed becomes available. These adjustments will be finalized no later than one year from the acquisition date. During the year ended May 31, 2025, purchase price allocation adjustments were immaterial.\n \nThe following table summarizes the components of the purchase consideration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions, except per share amounts\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of shares of Paycor common stock outstanding \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n180.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash consideration (per share of common stock)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n22.50\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal cash consideration\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n4,060.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFair value of Paycor equity awards replaced by Paychex for pre-combination services \n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n25.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal equity consideration\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n25.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal purchase consideration\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n4,085.7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(1)\nRepresents outstanding shares of Paycor common stock as of April 11, 2025.\n(2)\nRepresents the fair value of Paycor's stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services.

The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was estimated using a multi-period excess earnings method. The cash flow projections for the acquired Paycor customer relationships reflected significant judgments and assumptions including the revenue growth rate, customer attrition rate, and discount rate.

The supplemental pro forma financial information does not necessarily represent what the combined companies’ revenue or results of operations would have been had the Paycor Acquisition been completed on June 1, 2023, nor is it intended to be a projection of future operating results of the combined company. It also does not reflect any operating efficiencies or potential cost savings that might be achieved from synergies of combining Paychex and Paycor.\nThe unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information reflects primarily pro forma adjustments related to removal of seller's amortization of cost to obtain and fulfill contracts, elimination of seller's stock-based compensation expense offset by compensation expense related to replacement awards and settlement of seller awards, amortization expense for step-up in fair value estimates of intangible assets, and interest expense and deferred financing cost amortization related to the fixed rate-corporate bonds issued to finance the Paycor Acquisition. The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information includes transaction charges associated with the Paycor Acquisition. There are no material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the Paycor Acquisition included in the reported pro forma revenue and loss from continuing operations before income taxes.\nPaycor’s fiscal year end is June 30\nth\n. Since Paycor and the Company had different fiscal year end dates, the unaudited pro forma operating results were prepared based on comparable periods. The pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of the results that would have been obtained had the transactions been completed as of June 1, 2023, for the periods presented and are not intended to be a projection of future results or trends.\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nAlterna Capital Solutions LLC\n \nEffective July 31, 2023, substantially all of the net assets of Alterna Capital Solutions LLC (“Alterna”), were acquired by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Alterna purchases outstanding accounts receivable of their customers under non-recourse arrangements. This acquisition allows the Company to increase and diversify its portfolio of solutions and support serving small- to medium-sized businesses. The acquisition consideration was comprised of a base purchase price of $\n95.1\n million plus immediate settlement of debt totaling $\n128.9\n million, net of $\n15.7\n million in cash and restricted cash acquired. Accounts receivable balances acquired, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and less amounts due to clients related to funding arrangements, totaled $\n146.1\n million. Management determined that intangible assets related to the client list were $\n18.9\n million to be amortized utilizing an accelerated method of amortization over a weighted average of \n8\n years. Goodwill in the amount of $\n46.7\n million was recorded as a result of the acquisition, which is tax-deductible. The Company finalized the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Alterna as of November 30, 2023. The financial results of Alterna are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from its respective date of acquisition.

As of May 31, 2025, there were \n12.0\n million\n shares available for future grants under the 2002 Plan. The Company issues new shares of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises, issuances under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan, and stock awards.\n \nAll stock-based awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. These costs are recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and an increase in additional paid-in capital.\n \nStock-based compensation expense was \n$\n111.8\n million\n, \n$\n61.1\n million\n, and \n$\n62.6\n million\n for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

For each unit granted, the holder will receive one share of Paychex common stock at the time of vesting. Prior to fiscal 2023, the Company also granted RSAs to certain executives and outside directors. All shares underlying RSAs are restricted in that they are not transferable until they vest. If the recipient does not vest in the awards, due to leaving Paychex, all shares or units, and any dividends accrued thereon, when applicable, will be forfeited and returned to the Company.\n \nTime-Based RSUs and RSAs: \nTime-based RSUs and RSAs granted to executives vest \none-third\n per annum over \nthree years\n. Time-based RSUs and RSAs granted to non-executive employees vest on a graded basis over a \nfour\n- or \nfive-year\n period. Time-based RSUs and RSAs granted to outside directors vest on the \none-year\n anniversary of the grant date. Vesting is generally achieved on these dates with active employment or participation as a member of the Board on the date of vesting.\n \n \nPaycor Replacement Awards: \nIn \nconnection with the acquisition of Paycor, the Company exchanged certain unvested Paycor employee equity awards for Paychex RSUs or RSAs based on an exchange ratio of approximately \n1\n to \n0.15\n calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement (the \"Replacement Awards\"). The fair value of the Replacement Awards wa\ns $\n105.2\n million as of the date of acquisition, of which $\n15.9\n million was related to pre-combination expense and was included in the purchase price. The remaining portion of $\n89.3\n m\nillion relates to post-combination expense, of whic\nh $\n39.1\n m\nillion was expensed\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\ndue to the acceleration of awards as of May 31, 2025. As of May 31, 2025, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Replacement Awards was ap\nproximately $\n42.5\n million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n1.9\n years.

The estimated volatility factor is estimated based on historical volatility, using stock prices over a period equal to the measurement period. The measurement period is based on the remaining term from the date of grant to the end of the performance period.\n \nThe fair value of performance-based RSUs and RSAs with a performance condition and no market condition is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends over the performance period.\n \nNon-compensatory employee benefit plan: \nThe Company offers a qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to all employees. The Company’s common stock can be purchased through a payroll deduction at a discount to the market price. The qualified ESPP allows for a discount of up to \n15\n% based on the sole discretion of the committee established to administer the plan. For offering periods during fiscal years \n2025, 2024, and 2023\n the discount was set at \n5\n% of the market price. Transactions under the qualified ESPP occur through the Company’s third-party stock plan administrator. The plans have been deemed non-compensatory and therefore, \nno\n stock-based compensation costs have been recognized for fiscal years \n2025, 2024, or 2023\n related to the plan.\n \nNote G — Funds

The Company believes the investments held as of May 31, 2025 that had gross unrealized losses of $\n68.0\n million were not impaired due to credit risk or other valuation concerns and was not required to record a credit loss or an allowance for credit losses on its AFS securities. The Company believes it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with contractual terms and that the unrealized losses on these securities were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns. A substantial portion of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of May 31, 2025 and 2024 held an AA rating or better. The Company does not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believes that it is not more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell these investments prior to that time. The Company’s assessment that an investment is not impaired due to credit risk or other valuation concerns could change in the future due to new developments or changes in the Company’s strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.\n \nRealized gains and losses from the sale of AFS securities were as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross realized gains\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n0.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross realized losses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n9.9\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet realized (losses)/gains\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2.6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n(\n9.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nThe amortized cost and fair value of AFS securities that had stated maturities as of \nMay 31, 2025 are shown below by expected maturity.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmortized\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFair\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\ncost\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nvalue\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaturity date:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue in one year or less\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n624.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n618.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue after one year through three years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,128.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,086.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue after three years through five years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n770.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n762.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue after five years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n285.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n287.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n3,809.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n3,755.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nVariable rate demand notes (“VRDNs”) are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically \n20\n to \n30 years\n.

The accounting standards related to fair value measurements include a hierarchy for information and valuations used in measuring fair value that is broken down into three levels based on reliability, as follows:\n \n•\nLevel 1 valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the Company can access at the measurement date.\n \n•\nLevel 2 valuations are based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the instrument, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability including the following:\no\nquoted prices for similar, but not identical, instruments in active markets;\no\nquoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active;\no\ninputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the instrument; or\no\ninputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. \n \n•\nLevel 3 valuations are based on information that is unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\n \nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, PEO unbilled receivables, net of advance collections, accounts payable and short-term borrowings, when used by the Company, approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Marketable securities included in funds held for clients and corporate investments consist primarily of securities classified as AFS and are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\n \n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as

Contents\n \n\n\n \n \nIn determining the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company predominately uses the market approach. Money market securities, which are cash equivalents, are considered Level 1 investments as they are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Cash equivalents also include corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and U.S. government agency and treasury securities with original maturities of 90 days or less which are considered Level 2 investments as they are valued based on similar, but not identical, instruments in active markets. AFS securities, including asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and VRDNs, when held by the Company, are included in Level 2 and are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of the Company’s Level 2 AFS securities, the independent pricing service uses a variety of inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, non-binding broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, new issue data, and monthly payment information. The Company has not adjusted the prices obtained from the independent pricing service because it believes that they are appropriately valued.\n \nAssets included as other are mutual fund investments, consisting of participants’ eligible deferral contributions under the Company’s non-qualified and unfunded deferred compensation plans. The related liability is reported as other long-term liabilities. The mutual funds are considered Level 1 investments as they are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets.\n \nThe Company’s long-term borrowings are accounted for on a historical cost basis. The amortized cost and \nfair value of these borrowings were as follows:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmortized\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFair\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmortized\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFair\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\ncost\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nvalue\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ncost\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nvalue\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Notes, Series A\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n399.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n398.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n399.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n391.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Notes, Series B\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n399.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n395.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n399.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n386.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-Year Fixed Rate Bonds\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,484.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,505.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-Year Fixed Rate Bonds\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,482.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,504.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10-Year Fixed Rate Bonds\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,181.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,201.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal long-term borrowings, net of debt issuance costs\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n4,948.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n5,005.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n798.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n777.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Company’s Senior Notes, Series A and Senior Notes, Series B borrowings are not traded in active markets, and as a result, its fair values were estimated using a market approach employing Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates the Company believes are currently available based on loans with similar terms and maturities.\n \n \nThe Company's fixed-rate corporate bonds (\"Corporate Bonds\") are not traded on active markets. The fair value of Corporate Bonds was estimated using a market approach employing Level 2 valuation inputs obtained from an independent pricing service. The Company reviews the values generated by the independent pricing service for reasonableness and has not adjusted the prices obtained because it believes that they are appropriately valued.\n \n \nThe preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\n \n\n\n67\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nNote I — Leases\n \nThe Company’s lease portfolio consists primarily of operating leases for office space and has remaining terms from less than \none year\n up to \nten years\n, with contractual terms expiring from \n2025\n to \n2032\n.

Fiscal years 2018 and 2020 are currently under audit by the IRS. With limited exception, state income tax audits by taxing authorities are closed through fiscal 2021, primarily due to expiration of the statute of limitations.\n \nThe Company continues to follow its policy of recognizing interest and penalties accrued on tax positions as a component of income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with the Company’s tax positions is immaterial to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of interest and penalties recognized for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023\n was immaterial to the Company’s results of operations.\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nNote M — Short-term Financing\n \n \nThe Company maintains committed and unsecured credit facilities and irrevocable letters of credit as part of its normal and recurring business operations.

The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee, ranging from \n0.05\n% to \n0.15\n%, related to the unutilized portion of each credit facility. The commitment fee is determined on a sliding-scale basis based upon the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio.\n \n \nOn April 12, 2024, the Company and Paychex of New York LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“PoNY”), entered into an amendment (the “2019 Credit Facility Amendment”) to its $\n1.0\n billion, \nfive-year\n, unsecured, revolving credit facility (the “2019 Credit Facility”), for which JPM acts as Administrative Agent.

The 2017 Credit Facility Amendment, among other things, (a) amended the interest rate provisions under the 2017 Credit Facility, and (b) made other ministerial changes to the 2017 Credit Facility.\n \n \nObligations under the credit facilities are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The credit facilities contain financial and operational covenants with which the Company must maintain compliance. The Company’s ability to borrow under the credit facilities may be restricted in the event of certain covenant breaches or events of default. In addition, the terms of the credit facilities could restrict the Company’s ability to engage in certain business transactions. The Company was in compliance with all these covenants as of May 31, 2025.\n \nCertain lenders under these credit facilities, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform for the Company, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting, and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will continue to receive in the future, customary fees and expenses.\n \n \n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nBridge Loan Commitment: \nOn January 7, 2025, the Company and a Company subsidiary, Paychex of New York, LLC, entered into a bridge loan commitment with JPM, pursuant to which JPM committed to provide a 364-day senior unsecured credit facility of up to $\n3.5\n billion for the acquisition of Paycor, including related fees and expenses. The Company incurred $\n14.9\n million in debt financing fees, including structuring and commitment fees, which were capitalized as Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and were recognized as interest expense on a straight-line basis. On April 10, 2025, the Company obtained alternative financing through the issuance of its Corporate Bonds, effectively canceling the bridge loan commitment. Refer to Note N for further discussion of the Corporate Bonds issued.\n \nInterest Rate Swaption Contracts: \nOn January 31, 2025, the Company executed three Swaption Contracts with JPM. The Swaption Contracts qualified as cash flow hedges, had an aggregate notional amount of $\n3.0\n billion, and were utilized to manage exposure to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates associated with the issuance of the Corporate Bonds to fund the acquisition of Paycor. At inception, the Company recorded Swaption Contract assets related to paid premiums of $\n19.2\n million. Upon issuing the Corporate Bonds, the Company elected not to exercise the Swaption Contracts, and wrote-off the hedge asset when it expired.\n \nLetters of credit:\n The Company had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $\n165.0\n million and $\n168.5\n million as of May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024\n, respectively, required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between \nJune 1, 2025\n and \nFebruary 28, 2027\n. \nNo\n amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal \n2025 or fiscal 2024, or as of May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024, respectively. Subsequent to May 31, 2025\n, eight letters of credit which expired were renewed for \none year\n terms.\n \n \nNote N — Long-term Financing\n \nLong-term debt, at amortized cost, consisted of the following as of:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEffective\n\n\nMay 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\ninterest rate\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Notes Series A, fixed rate      \n4.07\n% - due \nMarch 13, 2026\n\n\n \n\n\n4.14\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n400.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n400.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Notes Series B, fixed rate       \n4.25\n% - due \nMarch 13, 2029\n\n\n \n\n\n4.30\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n400.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n400.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-year Corporate Bonds, fixed rate   \n5.10\n% - due \nApril 15, 2030\n\n\n \n\n\n5.36\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,500.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-year Corporate Bonds, fixed rate   \n5.35\n% - due \nApril 15, 2032\n\n\n \n\n\n5.58\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,500.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10-year Corporate Bonds, fixed rate \n5.60\n% - due \nApril 15, 2035\n\n\n \n\n\n5.84\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,200.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal long-term debt\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,000.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n800.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: current portion, net of debt issuance costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n399.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: unamortized discount and debt issuance costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n51.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term debt, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,548.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n798.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe Senior Notes, Series A and Senior Notes, Series B (collectively the “Notes”), and Corporate Bonds are senior unsecured obligations, with interest paid semi-annually in arrears.

The Company was in compliance with all these covenants as of May 31, 2025\n.\n \nNote O — Supplemental Cash Flow Information\n \nCash\nIncome taxes paid were \n$\n512.4\n million, \n$\n539.5\n million, and \n$\n525.8\n million for fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2023, respectively.\n\n\n74\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nInterest expense paid was \n$\n37.5\n million, \n$\n36.2\n million, and \n$\n35.7\n million for fiscal 2025, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2023, respectively.\n \nNon-Cash\nIn fiscal 2025, there was non-cash consideration of $\n15.9\n million for pre-acquisition stock-based compensation and $\n9.2\n million for deferred compensation related to the Company's acquisition of Paycor, and $\n11.6\n million for the fair value of contingent consideration related to an earn-out for an immaterial acquisition. See Note D for further discussion of the Company's acquisition of Paycor.\n \nRefer to Note I of this Item 8 for supplemental cash flow information pertaining to the Company's leasing activities.\n \nNote P — Employee Benefit Plans\n \n401(k) plan: \nThe Company maintains a contributory savings plan that qualifies under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Paychex, Inc. 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) allows all employees to immediately participate in the salary deferral portion of the Plan, contributing up to a maximum of \n50\n% of their salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. Employees who have completed \none year\n of service and a minimum of \n1,000\n hours worked are eligible to receive a Company matching contribution, when such contribution is in effect. The Company provides a matching contribution of \n100\n% of the first \n3\n% and \n50\n% on the next \n2\n% of eligible pay for a total matching contribution of \n4\n%. \nCompany contributions to the Plan for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 were \n$\n37.0\n million\n, \n$\n37.5\n million\n, and \n$\n36.6\n million\n, respectively.\n \n \nThe Plan is \n100\n% participant directed. Plan participants can fully diversify their portfolios by choosing from any or all investment fund choices in the Plan. Transfers in and out of investment funds, including the Paychex, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan Stock Fund, are not restricted, except for certain restricted trading periods for individuals designated as insiders as specified in the Company’s Insider Trading Policy. The Company matching contribution, when in effect, follows the same fund elections as the employee compensation deferrals.\n \nDeferred compensation plans: \nThe Company and certain subsidiaries offer non-qualified and unfunded deferred compensation plans to a select group of key employees, executive officers, and outside directors. Eligible employees are provided with the opportunity to defer up to \n50\n% of their annual base salary and bonus and outside directors may defer \n100\n% of their Board cash compensation. Gains and losses are credited based on the participant’s election of a variety of investment choices. The Company does not match any participant deferral or guarantee its return. Distributions are paid at one of the following dates selected by the participant: the participant’s termination date, the date the part\nicipant retires from any active employment, or a designated specific date. The amounts accrued under these plans were \n$\n34.5\n million\n and \n$\n33.9\n million\n as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and are reflected in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \nNote Q — Commitments and Contingencies\n \nContingencies: \nThe Company is subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of its business. These include disputes or potential disputes related to breach of contract, tort, employment-related claims, tax claims, statutory, and other matters.\n \nThe Company’s management currently believes that resolution of any outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. However, legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and the results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.\n \nOther commitments: \nAs of May 31, 2025, the Company had outstanding commitments under existing workers’ compensation insurance agreements and legally binding contractual arrangements with minimum future payment obligations of approximately $\n620.9\n million. The Company also enters into various purchase commitments with vendors in the ordinary course of business and had outstanding commitments to purchase approximately $\n4.9\n million of capital assets. \nThese minimum future payment obligations relate to the following fiscal years: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPayments due by period\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2030\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers' compensation estimated obligations\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n80.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n41.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n26.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n18.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n12.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n56.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase obligations\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n213.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n47.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n34.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n11.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n8.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n69.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company makes representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees. The Company has also entered into indemnification agreements with its officers, directors, and non-officer fiduciaries of our pooled employer plan retirement offering, which require the Company to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future claims as they relate to their services provided to the Company.\n \nThe Company currently self-insures the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate employee and PEO employee health, medical, and workers' compensation benefit plans. The Company’s estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material and were not material as of May 31, 2025\n. The Company also maintains insurance coverage in addition to its purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, theft and embezzlement, cyber threats, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through its captive insurance company.\n \nNote R — Segment Reporting\n \nThe Company has determined that it operates as a single operating segment at the consolidated level. Operating segments for the Company are determined based on the information used by the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company's \nChief Executive Officer\n is the CODM and reviews the Company's financial information on a consolidated basis. \nAccordingly, the CODM primarily uses consolidated net income as the measure of segment profit or loss and to assess performance and allocate resources, primarily through the annual budgeting and forecasting process. B\nudget-to-actual variances are reviewed regularly\n, with consideration given to the impact of certain expenses that are not considered part of the Company's core business operations.\n \n \n\n\n76\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nTotal revenue, net income, and significant expenses used by the CODM for the purpose of allocating resources and evaluating the Company's financial performance were as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear ended May 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn millions\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenue\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n5,571.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n5,278.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n5,007.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore business operations:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompensation-related expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,853.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,810.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,782.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPEO direct insurance costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n520.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n471.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n416.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n168.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n176.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n176.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther segment items\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n659.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n606.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n598.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-core business operations:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition-related costs\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n162.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost optimization initiatives\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,364.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,104.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,974.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense, excluding Paycor acquisition-related costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n71.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n37.3\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n36.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition-related costs\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n34.0\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n73.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n81.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,175.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,218.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,048.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n518.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n527.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n490.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n1,657.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n1,690.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n \n\n\n1,557.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nOther segment items include professional service expense, marketing and advertising expenses, and other overhead expense.\n(2)\nAcquisition-related costs included in total expenses include the amortization of intangibles acquired in the acquisition of Paycor, compensation costs related to the acquisition and integration of Paycor, including replacement awards, severance, and retention and transaction bonuses, and other acquisition-related costs, primarily reflecting third-party professional service fees.

    "item1c": "Item 1C.    \nCybersecurity\n \nRisk Management and Strategy\n \nWe are committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and information. Our security program is intended to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats, and is aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Version 2.0 Cybersecurity Framework (“NIST CSF”). The NIST CSF provides a flexible model for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks. Our security infrastructure uses a layered controls approach, incorporating various capabilities guided by the NIST CSF and other industry standards and best practices. We routinely invest in our security processes and capabilities, including those related to our risk management and assessment programs, vulnerability and intrusion detection, incident response plans, and other advanced detection, prevention, and protection capabilities.\n \n \nWe conduct regular assessments of cybersecurity risks to identify threats to us and potential vulnerabilities that could negatively affect our business operations if exploited. \nWe track cybersecurity risks within our enterprise risk management system with cybersecurity threats considered to be among the top-priority risks to us.\n In addition, our Enterprise Security Organization (the “ESO”) conducts technical risk assessments, and, in some instances, we \nengage\n with third-party experts to assist with or perform technical risk assessments. The results of these risk assessments are reported to management. Our processes require escalation of significant cybersecurity risks to management and Paychex’s Audit Committee derived from the Board of Directors (the “Board”).\n \n \nThe ESO is led by our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) and seeks to maintain a consistent, resilient, and secure infrastructure by partnering with resources across the Company. The ESO implements numerous cybersecurity processes and capabilities, which include but are not limited to: assessing risk associated with significant infrastructure or operational changes and the introduction of new technologies; administering our third-party service provider risk management program; managing secure software development and change management; managing access management and logical access controls, identifying security vulnerabilities through automated scanning technologies; performing penetration testing and due diligence assessments; and protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s data in transit. The ESO includes the activities of the Paychex Cyber Fusion Center, which provides 24x7x365 cybersecurity monitoring and incident response. We maintain incident response plans which outline the escalation, investigation, reporting, and overall response procedures depending on the type and severity of incidents.\n \n \nAs part of our security program, we require all employees to take information security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter. We provide additional ongoing training to our employees about security best practices and awareness, including internal phishing simulations.\n \nWe maintain a program designed to assess and manage the cybersecurity-related risk associated with third-party service providers that we rely on as part of providing solutions to our clients.\n This program incorporates a risk-based approach based on service criticality and type of information. Vendor risk assessments are performed and documented within our vendor management system. As part of the vendor risk assessment, we conduct an information security program evaluation of critical third-party providers before engagement and, based on our assessment of the vendor’s risk, contractually require certain third parties we engage to implement security programs commensurate with their risk profile.\n \nAs of \nMay 31, 2025\n, we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition.\n We continue to invest in cyber-resilience and cyber-threat response preparedness as we anticipate ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats.
