  "item1_summary": " The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations . The industries we serve can be volatile and difficult to predict . The amount and mix of our customers’ capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can also significantly impact our operating results. Artificial intelligence is evolving rapidly and is a relatively new demand driver for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment .\n We may incur unexpected or additional costs to align our business operations with changes in demand . Markets for semiconductor and display equipment and services depend largely on business and consumer spending . Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions could result in decreases in spending and demand . We are exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy .\n Accelerated digital transformation may further increase demand and exacerbate shortages and strain our manufacturing capacity, which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues, operating results and financial condition . Some customers may scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations .\n The risks to our investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate due to rising inflation, rising interest rates, bank failures or economic recession . The value and liquidity of the investment portfolio and returns on pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges . In fiscal 2024, approximately 86% of our net revenue was to customers in regions outside the United States.\n Political instability, social unrest, terrorism, acts of war or other geopolitical turmoil, such as the conflict in the Middle East, may influence the value chain of the industries we serve . Political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including in China, the United States, and countries in Europe and Asia .\n Graphically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements . The need to provide technical support in different locations around the world; the need for a mobile workforce and travel to different regions; and uncertainty in economic growth rates in various countries .\n A majority of our products and services are delivered to customers in jurisdictions outside of the United States, including China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan . There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among the U.S. and the countries in which we conduct our business, that political, diplomatic, and national security factors can lead to global trade restrictions and changes in trade policies that affect the semiconductor industry .\n U.S. government announced additional export regulations for semiconductor technology sold in China, including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services, with disparate impact on companies in different jurisdictions . These regulations require us to obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products or provide services to certain customers in China . Obtaining export licenses may be difficult and time-consuming, and there is no assurance we will be issued licenses on a timely basis or at all .\n The U.S. and other governments may promulgate new or additional export licensing or other requirements that have the effect of further limiting our ability to provide certain products and services to customers outside the United States . The government may also continue to add customers to its “entity List” or promulgate additional restrictions, or take measures that could disrupt our product shipments or the provision of services to certain customers .\n A relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our business . Government authorities may take retaliatory actions, impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of sensitive data or intellectual property . The geographic concentration of our customer base could shift over time as a result of changes in technology and technology .\n The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year . Major customers may seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us . The concentration of our customer base increases our risks related to the financial condition of our customers .\n Our business depends on our timely supply of products and services to meet the changing requirements of our customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services from suppliers and contract manufacturers . Increases in demand for our products and worldwide demand for semiconductor chips and electronic devices can impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements .\n We may further experience supply chain disruptions, significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver or install products or services, increased costs, customer order cancellations or reduced demand for our products . Failure to timely recover from such delays could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations .\n A worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products in general; increased costs due to rising inflation or interest rates or other market conditions . The company may transfer its business to alternative sources, which may result in manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties . The firm may transfer business to other suppliers, which could lead to manufacturing delays and additional costs .\n If we are unable to meet demand for certain parts or components, we may have to delay or cancel orders . These outcomes could have a negative impact on our manufacturing and supply chain operations . If we do not meet demand, we will have to wait for parts to be delivered . We may also have to pay more for parts that are not available in time for delivery to meet the demand .\n The report was published on June 1, 2013, 2013 . The study was published by Analog America, Inc., Inc. and other companies in the semiconductor, display and other industries in which we operate . The report discusses the impact of government incentives, trade, regulatory, tax or government incentives on investment in new or expanded fabrication plants and on demand for our products .\n The largest proportion of our consolidated net revenue and profitability is derived from our Semiconductor Systems segment’s sale of a wide range of equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips . The semiconductor industry is characterized by factors particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of our semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products .\n The concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where our service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions . Semiconductor manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, resulting in diminished need to purchase new equipment and services from us . The continuing importance of specialty markets (such as internet of things, communications, automotive, power and sensors) tha\n The global display industry has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers . Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays . The increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, are factors that impact demand for and the profitability of our display products and services .\n The display industry has experienced decreased levels of investment in display fabrication equipment . If we do not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, our business and our operating results may continue to be adversely impacted . We operate in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and our future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies .\n The development, introduction and support of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment requires collaboration with customers and other industry participants . New or improved products may entail higher costs, longer development cycles, lower profits and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects . To compete successfully, we must address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand in a timely and effective manner .\n We are exposed to risks related to government incentives and other agreements that may involve government entities . We enter into agreements with government entities for grants, tax benefits and other incentives . If we do not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, our business performance and operating results may be materially and adversely impacted .\n We are exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries . Compliance with these requirements may add complexity to our operations and increase our costs . Failure to comply could result in fines, investigations, civil and criminal penalties, forfeiture of profits and forfeiture of revenues . Failure of compliance could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations .\n We are exposed to risks related to the use of artificial intelligence by us and our competitors . We are increasingly incorporating artificial intelligence capabilities into the development of technologies and our business operations, and into our products and services . Artificial intelligence technology is complex and rapidly evolving, and may subject us to significant competitive, legal, regulatory, operational and other risks .\n Artificial intelligence algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed, and datasets may contain irrelevant, insufficient or biased information, which can cause errors in output . The use of artificial intelligence in the development of our products and services could also cause loss of intellectual property, as well as risks related to intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, data privacy and cybersecurity .\n Monitoring and detecting any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult and costly and we cannot be certain that the protective measures we have implemented will completely prevent misuse . Our ability to enforce and protect intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks and uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries . Changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact our ability to protect and assert .\n In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and otherwise process data using information technology systems . Cybersecurity incidents may range from physical attacks on our computer system or network infrastructure, to employee or contractor error or misuse or unauthorized use of information . Threat actors may also attempt to influence employees, suppliers and other third-party providers .\n Cybersecurity attacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed . Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and increasing tension with China, may create a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks . We are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents impacting our information systems that have been determined to have a material impact on us to date .\n Cybersecurity incidents, including cybersecurity incidents on third-party provider networks, may result in business disruption . Company may be unable to anticipate, prevent, or remediate future attacks, vulnerabilities, breaches, or incidents, and in some instances we may be unaware of vulnerabilities or cybersecurity breaches or incidents or their magnitude and effects . Damage could include reputational damage, private claims, demands, and litigation or regulatory investigations .\n We are exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures . Customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, confidentiality, and intellectual property . We may engage in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets .\n The company’s credit rating could adversely impact our access to and cost of capital . The company has not been able to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from existing markets . It also has been unable to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments . The firm has been criticized for being too reliant on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners .\n The risks to our investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions . The value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges . We may seek to divest portions of our business that are not deemed to fit with our strategic plan. Divestitures involve additional risks and uncertainties .\n The ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to our success . Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management or organizational changes, ongoing competition for talent . The loss of knowledgeable and experienced employees may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls .\n An increase in our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could, in turn, have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition . Several countries where we do business have enacted global minimum tax regimes based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project .\n The proposed plans to implement global minimum tax regimes could reduce or eliminate the benefits of our tax incentives . As of October 27, 2024, we had $6.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding . We may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates .\n If we fail to satisfy our debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, we may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable . Failures of information systems we use could disrupt our operations, impede our ability to timely and accurately process and report financial results, and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations .\n We have a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions . Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year . We may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment is determined to exist .\n Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors . Future dividends and share repurchases may be affected by, among other factors, our cash flow; potential future capital requirements for investments, acquisitions, infrastructure projects, and research and development; changes in applicable tax, corporate, or other laws .\n Legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations, whether with or without merit, and internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct . We cannot predict the outcome of current or future legal proceedings . We are exposed to risks related to the global regulatory environment . Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws may affect our business .\n Compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact our business . Violations of law, regulations, including those related to financial and other disclosures, trade (including import and export regulations) could result in fines, criminal penalties, restrictions on our reputation, and damage to our reputation .\n Standards and processes for measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and other sustainability metrics may change over time, and may result in inconsistent data . Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of planned investments and technology innovations related to sustainability could adversely impact the demand for our products and subject us to significant costs and liabilities and reputational risks . We are subject to new climate and sustainability laws and regulations .\n Failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental, health and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipping or use of certain of our products; limitations on the operation of our facilities; and a decrease in the value of our real property .\n We conduct assessments based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity (NIST) Framework . We engage third-parties for assistance and to independently assess, proactively monitor, and provide an external view of our cybersecurity program . We are not aware of having directly experienced a cybersecurity inci.y incident response plan and escalation protocols .\n We face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, could reasonably likely materially affect us, our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition . See “Risk Factors - Operational and Financial Risks – We are exposed to cybersecurity threats and incidents” for additional information about cybersecurity related risks .\n The CISO reports to our Chief Information Officer (“CIO), who has more than 30 years of experience in information technology .
