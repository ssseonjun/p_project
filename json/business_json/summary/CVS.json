The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“the CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments .\n Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP .
