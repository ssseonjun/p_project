Our history dates back more than 150 years, with origins in both Australia and the United States of America. Today, we are the global leader in developing and producing responsible consumer packaging and dispensing solutions across a variety of materials for nutrition, health, beauty and wellness categories. Our global product innovation and sustainability expertise enables us to solve packaging challenges around the world every day, producing a range of flexible packaging, rigid packaging, cartons and closures that are more sustainable, functional and appealing for our customers and their consumers. We are guided by our purpose of elevating customers, shaping lives and protecting the future.\nBerry Global Group, Inc. Merger\n \n    On April 30, 2025, we completed our merger (\"Merger\") with Berry Global Group, Inc. (\"Berry\"), a global manufacturer of rigid and flexible packaging products, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") between Amcor, Aurora Spirit, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Berry dated, November 19, 2024. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Berry shareholders received 7.25 Amcor ordinary shares for each share of Berry common stock issued and outstanding. Upon completion of the transaction, Berry shares were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.\nBusiness Strategy\nStrategy\n    Our business strategy is focused on three elements: customers, sustainability and innovation, and portfolio.\nCustomer\n    We embrace a growth-oriented, customer-first mindset, leveraging our global scale and capabilities to deliver exceptional value. We empower our teams with the tools, processes, and skills needed to operationalize growth, accelerate volume expansion, and sustain profitability.\nSustainability and innovation\n    Our goal is to position ourself as the partner of choice to solve sustainability challenges across multiple substrates by driving circularity and decarbonization. We champion effective substrate solutions intended to eliminate waste, lower our carbon footprint, and increase recycling rates, advancing both environmental impact and portfolio value\n.\nPortfolio \n \n    Amcor is the global leader in consumer packaging and dispensing solutions for nutrition, health, beauty and wellness categories. We have leading positions in large, resilient and growing end markets where we have significant room for growth via disciplined organic growth and long-term strategic mergers and acquisitions which requires innovative and advanced solutions. We aim to drive value through orienting our core portfolio toward faster-growing, higher-margin categories and leveraging our competitive advantages which includes global scale and breadth, innovation, material science, technical and innovation capabilities, and leadership.\n    We believe this strategy will help us achieve our vision to become the packaging partner of choice, known for sustainability, market leadership, delivering consistent levels of volume driven organic growth, and sustainable value aligned with Amcor’s \"Shareholder Value Creation Model\".\nShareholder value creation\n     Through our focus on our customer, sustainability and innovation, and portfolio, we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior value for shareholders. Long-term value creation has been strong and consistent \n6\nand has reflected a combination of dividends, organic growth in the base business, and using free cash flow to pursue targeted acquisitions and/or returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks.\n     The strategic Merger with Berry is expected to significantly increase cash generation, enabling increased investment in organic growth, targeted acquisitions, and enhanced shareholder returns, driving long-term value creation.\nSegment Information\n    Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 280, \"Segment Reporting,\" establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, we have determined we have two reportable segments, Global Flexible Packaging Solutions and Global Rigid Packaging Solutions. The reportable segments produce flexible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and dispensing closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to Note 21, \"Segments,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reportable segments.\nGlobal Flexible Packaging Solutions Segment\n    Our Global Flexible Packaging Solutions Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 42,000 employees at 210 manufacturing and support facilities in 36 countries as of June 30, 2025, the Global Flexible Packaging Solutions Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of polymer resin, aluminum, and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2025, the Global Flexible Packaging Solutions segment accounted for approximately 72% of consolidated net sales.\nGlobal Rigid Packaging Solutions Segment\n    Our Global Rigid Packaging Solutions\n \nSegment manufactures rigid packaging containers, closures, dispensing and pharma devices, and related products globally.

In fiscal year 2025, the Global Rigid Packaging Solutions accounted for approximately 28% of consolidated net sales.\nExpertise across Packaging Materials\n    We believe we are uniquely positioned to offer a variety of multi format packaging solutions with a wide, differentiated portfolio of products. Behind every one of our products stands a unique combination of technical know-how, business experience, and expertise. We work closely with our customers to identify feasible, high-performance, responsible packaging solutions based on their unique needs. Where solutions do not currently exist, we work to innovate new ones.\n    Our packaging expertise covers all main packaging materials including paper, aluminum, polymer resins, recycled, and bio-based materials and the sustainable use of recyclable materials.\nSustainability and Innovation\n    Sustainability is comprehensively embedded across our business, from the investments we are making in packaging innovation\n \nand\n \ndesign,\n \nto\n \nthe\n \nwork\n \nwe\n \nundertake\n \nwithin\n \nour\n \nown\n \noperations\n \nand\n \nwith\n \nour\n \nupstream\n \nand\n \ndownstream\n \npartners\n \nto develop a more responsible packaging value chain.\n    We believe there will always be a role for the primary packaging we produce to preserve food, beverages, and healthcare products, as well as protect consumers, and promote brands. Consumers also want cost effective, convenient, and easy-to-use packaging with a reduced environmental footprint and a responsible end-of-life solution. We have identified a clear path to provide food, beverages, and healthcare products to people around the world in a more sustainable way and meet our sustainability ambitions and those of our customers, by focusing on three key elements of responsible packaging: product innovation, consumer participation, and waste management infrastructure. Our responsible packaging solutions address how the product is made, how the consumer interacts with it and what happens after the consumer uses it, offering a wide variety of options to advance sustainability while meeting our customers’ specific packaging needs. We believe this commitment is integral to our success and offers important and exciting opportunities for growth.\n7\n    For years, Amcor has been an industry leader in driving progress toward a circular economy for packaging. In January 2018, we became the world’s first packaging company to pledge that all our packaging would be designed to be recyclable, compostable, or reusable by 2025, and also committed to increasing the amount of recycled materials we use. In November 2022, we further increased our target for use of recycled materials to 30% by 2030. We continue making progress toward these commitments and leading in the development of a responsible packaging value chain through our innovations and partnerships.\n    Innovation is central to Amcor’s approach to sustainability and we expect to spend approximately $180 million a year on research and development (\"R&D\") after the Merger, not including ongoing investments in continuous improvements. We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and have over 7,000 patents, registered designs and trademarks, as well as a global network of Innovation Centers focused on bringing advanced packaging technologies and more sustainable material science to our markets around the world. We solve packaging challenges by developing differentiated products, services, and processes to protect our customers' products and fulfill the needs of the consumers who rely on them. Drawing on our unrivaled heritage in design, science, and manufacturing, approximately 1,500 Amcor R&D professionals are constantly innovating across new materials, formats, functions, and technologies to provide products with superior clarity, protection, design versatility, consumer safety, convenience, cost efficiency, barrier properties and environmental performance.\n    We collaborate with like-minded partners, including customers and suppliers, in pursuit of innovative solutions to address some of the world’s most urgent challenges, such as increasing recycling and reuse and reducing our environmental impacts. We partner with non-governmental organizations, promising startups, and cross-industry initiatives and bodies, which enable us to learn, experience other perspectives, share our expertise, and expand our innovation. With our partners, we advocate for sound global design standards, better waste management infrastructure, and higher levels of consumer participation in recycling that will be required to develop a true circular economy for packaging. Amcor’s combination with Berry also brought several in-house recycling operations into our footprint, enabling us to drive impact on packaging circularity directly, as well as through our value chain collaborations.\n    We know that our environmental footprint also extends beyond the products we create and we strive to reduce the environmental impacts of our operations. For more than a decade, our EnviroAction program has helped us significantly improve how we manage energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water, and waste in our manufacturing locations. We have further increased our ambition by setting near-term and net zero science-based targets to reduce GHG emissions and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Our targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative in fiscal year 2024. The 2024 targets build on years of progress under our EnviroAction program. Our decarbonization roadmap, which was released at the start of fiscal year 2025, outlines our strategy for continuing momentum by focusing on five key GHG emission levers: renewable electricity, supply chain footprint reduction, recycled materials, product redesign, and operational efficiency. Following our combination with Berry, we are in the process of re-baselining our science-based targets to reflect Amcor's updated footprint. We plan to submit the updated targets to the Science Based Targets initiative for validation in early fiscal year 2026.\n    With our global scale, deep industry experience, and strong capabilities, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead the way in meeting our customers’ growing sustainability expectations and we aspire to improve the quality of lives, protect ecosystems, and preserve natural resources for future generations.\nMarketing, Distribution, and Competition\n    Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but predominantly through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located primarily throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, field service technicians, and customer service teams. Our scale enables us to dedicate certain sales and marketing efforts to particular products or customers, when applicable, which supports us in developing expertise that we believe is valued by our customers.\n    We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales in the last three fiscal years.\n    The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, sustainability, innovation, quality, and price. We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we operate. Competitors include 3M, AptarGroup, Inc., Ball Corporation, Inc, CCL Industries Inc., Crown Holdings, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company, Huhtamaki Oyj, International Paper Company, Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, O-I Glass, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Sigma Plastics Group, Silgan Holdings Inc., and Sonoco Products Company, and a variety of privately held companies. \n8\nBacklog\n    Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions. We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the markets in which we operate.\nRaw Materials\n    Polymer resins and films, paper, linerboard, rayon, polyester fiber, inks, solvents, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use. These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources, and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials. While we have experienced industry-wide shortages of certain raw materials in the past, we have been able to manage supply disruptions by working closely with our suppliers and customers. Supply shortages, along with other factors, can lead and have in the past led to increased raw material price volatility. Increases in the price of raw materials are generally able to be passed on to customers including through contractual price mechanisms over time. We manage the risks associated with our supply chain and have generally been able to maintain adequate raw materials through relationship management, inventory management, and evaluation of alternative sources when practical.
