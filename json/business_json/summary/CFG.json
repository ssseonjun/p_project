  "item1_summary": " As a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in what we do and decisions we make . The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face and should not be considered a complete list of risks that we may encounter . Additional risks not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business .\n Citizens Financial Group, Inc. is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the federal banking regulators, as well as the CFPB . Any regulator-imposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan, expand our business, continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders .\n Liquidity risk is the risk arising from the inability to meet our obligations when they come due . We rely on customer deposits to be our primary stable and low-cost source of funding . We must maintain adequate funding to meet current and future obligations, including customer loan requests, deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, leases, and other cash commitments .\n Changes in interest rates can have a material impact on our net interest income, net interest margin, fee income, and credit costs . An increase in rates could lower the collateral value of these securities, reducing the amount we could borrow, and lead to losses in the event of their sale . Citizens Financial Group, Inc. says interest rates may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and profitability .\n Changes in the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates can also have a material impact on our net interest income and net interest margin . A prolonged period of low interest rates may result in us holding lower yielding loans and securities . An increase in rates could cause the recognition of losses on our AFS securities portfolio if the securities needed to be sold .\n The marketplace for skilled personnel continues to be competitive, which means the cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to rise . Failure to attract and retain highly-skilled and qualified personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations .\n A ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market our securities, including long-term debt, and engage in certain longer-term derivative transactions . Citizens Financial Group, Inc. may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating, post additional collateral or terminate such contracts . A significant portion of our earnings assets are in the form of loans to borrowers across the U.S.\n The trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality have caused, and in the future may cause, us to experience credit losses, impairment charges, increased repurchase demands, higher recovery costs, and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions . An important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify, measure, monitor and mitigate the existing and emerging credit risk .\n Employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk, which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system . FASB and SEC periodically change financial accounting and reporting standards that govern accounting for our financial results and preparation of our consolidated financial statements . Citizens Financial Group, Inc. says changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition .\n Models may be used in processes such as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks . Poorly designed or implemented models could adversely affect our business decisions if the information is inadequate . In these instances, our ability to manage risk would be limited and risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated .\n The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make subjective determinations and use estimates that may vary from actual results and materially impact our financial condition and results of operations . Certain accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain . Our critical accounting estimates include the ACL, fair value measurements and the evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment .\n It is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks we face . Failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization; failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements and business conduct rules; equipment failures, including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical, telecommunications or other essential utility outages; business continuity and data security system failures .\n We believe our success depends, to a great extent, on our ability to utilize technology to offer products and services that address the needs of our customers . We may not be able to, among other things, keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes, implement new technology-driven products or be successful in marketing these products .\n We are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we conduct our business . Organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties present a significant information security risk to large financial institutions such as us . Employee error, failure to follow security procedures, or malfeasance also present these risks .\n Citizens Financial Group is under continuous threat of loss or network degradation due to cyber-attacks . Cybercriminals can use fraudulent schemes directly targeting our customers or our own systems to compromise and extract funds from a customer’s account or access sensitive customer data . Certain technology protections such as Customer Profiling and Step-Up Authentications have been implemented, but there can be no assurance that these protections will be effective .\n A successful cyber-attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected . System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones . Cyber-attacks against the patches themselves have also proven to be a significant risk that companies will have to address going forward . The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks .\n Failure, interruption or breach in the security of our communication and information systems, including due to cyber-attacks or our failure to adequately maintain and manage our systems, could result in failures or disruptions in our systems . The occurrence of any failure, interruption of our information systems could require us to devote substantial resources to recovery and response efforts .\n Citizens Financial Group: We rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology . We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate third or fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us . We are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands .\n We are exposed to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions, press speculation and negative publicity, among other factors, could damage our brands or reputation . The occurrence of catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorists attacks, extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, or tornadoes, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations .\n Ongoing geopolitical instability, such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, has negatively impacted the global and U.S. economies . The extent to which such instability adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable . Adverse economic conditions could require us to charge off a higher percentage of loans and increase the provision for credit losses .\n Citizens Financial Group: We operate in a highly competitive industry . Technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks . The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee income .\n There is global concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters . Climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our operations, businesses and customers . We could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, either of which would adversely affect profitability .\n The conditions of other financial institutions or of the financial services industry could adversely affect our operations and financial condition . The default by any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions . Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs .\n Roup, Inc. is subject to comprehensive regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations . The failure to meet supervisory expectations can result in practical limitations on the ability of a bank, BHC or FHC to engage in new activities, pursue growth opportunities, engage in acquisitions, return capital to shareholders .\n The terms of any such supervisory or enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations . We could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period . To maintain FHC status, a BHC and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized”\n Citizens Financial Group is heavily regulated by multiple banking, consumer protection, securities and other regulatory authorities at the federal and state levels . Changes to statutes, regulations, rules or policies, including their interpretation, implementation or enforcement, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including by limiting the types of financial services and other products we may offer .\n Many new regulatory initiatives and vigorous oversight and enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory and governmental authorities . Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage . A single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, including by multiple and state regulators and other authorities .\n The final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remains uncertain . The Parent Company could be required to act as a “source of strength” to CBNA, which would have a material adverse effect on CBNA’s business, financial condition and results of operations .\n The Parent Company depends on CBNA for substantially all of its revenue, and restrictions on dividends and other distributions by CBNA could affect its liquidity and ability to fulfill its obligations . In the event of a BHC’s bankruptcy, any commitment that the BHC had been required to make by a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee .\n In the event CBNA is unable to pay dividends to the Parent Company, it may not be able to make debt service payments, pay obligations or pay dividends on its common stock . The inability to receive dividends from CBNA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations . We may be required to make significant restitution payments to CBNA customers arising from certain compliance issues .\n Citizens Financial Group: We operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose us to potentially significant litigation risk . Adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations . The company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations and class actions .\n We are subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism . Monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules can put a significant financial burden on banks and other financial institutions . Our stock price may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result . You should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky .\n Citizens Financial Group, Inc. cribed in this “Risk Factors” section, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control . These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: quarterly variations in our results of operations or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us .\n “Anti-takeover” provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders . As a BHC, our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the rules of the FRB regarding capital adequacy and dividends .\n The Company’s Cybersecurity Program (“CSP”) drives an end-to-end, continuous process that protects our customers, colleagues, assets, premises, systems, and information . Banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution . These laws include the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act .\n The effectiveness of the CSP is assessed and measured periodically by various lines of defense within the Company . External organizations are also routinely engaged to assess our CSP and test our perimeter defenses . Results are reported to key stakeholders and identified issues are tracked and monitored . The effectiveness is reported periodically to the appropriate governance committees .\n The National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework is the primary standard against which we maintain . The CSP is presented by the Risk Committee annually for approval in conjunction with the annual review of the CSP . The Risk Committee is responsible for oversight of the cybersecurity risk consistent with the framework . The Committee also provides updates on cybersecurity updates as part of the report .\n The Board is provided with relevant cybersecurity training on an annual basis, with any additional training provided as requested . y, cyber defenses and risk management capabilities are included in the board's cybersecurity training . The Board will also be required to provide additional training on cybersecurity training as requested by the board . The board is required to maintain the appropriate knowledge for providing effective oversight of the Board of Directors ."
