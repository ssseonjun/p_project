The timing of any repurchases is dependent on several factors, including the market price of the Company's securities, the Company's capital position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the Company's financial strength or credit ratings, the Company's blackout periods, and other considerations.\n36\n|\nTable of Contents\nPart II - Item 5.\n \nMarket for the Hartford's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n|\nTOTAL RETURN TO STOCKHOLDERS\nThe following table presents The Hartford’s five-year total return on its common stock including reinvestment of dividends in comparison to the S&P 500 and the S&P Insurance Composite Index.\nCumulative Five-Year Total Return\nBase Period\nCompany/Index\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nThe Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.\n$\n100 \n$\n83.08 \n$\n119.85 \n$\n134.61 \n$\n146.09 \n$\n202.42 \nS&P 500 Index\n$\n100 \n$\n118.40 \n$\n152.39 \n$\n124.79 \n$\n157.59 \n$\n197.02 \nS&P Insurance Composite Index\n$\n100 \n$\n99.56 \n$\n131.54 \n$\n144.86 \n$\n158.28 \n$\n200.73 \n37\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Also, for those realized gains and losses caused by changes in interest rates, U.S. STAT for life insurance companies defers and amortizes the gains and losses into income over the original life to maturity of the asset sold (the Interest Maintenance Reserve) while U.S. GAAP does not.\n•\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is tested for recoverability on an annual basis (or more frequently, as necessary) for U.S. GAAP, while under U.S. STAT goodwill is amortized over a period not to exceed 10 years and the amount of goodwill admitted as an asset is limited.\n•\nThe deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance for losses ceded to the Navigators and A&E ADC agreements is recognized within a special category of surplus under U.S. STAT but is recognized within other liabilities under U.S. GAAP. In addition, the pattern of amortizing the deferred gain for GAAP and releasing special surplus for STAT is different. For GAAP the deferred gain is amortized in proportion of actual recoveries collected to total expected recoveries, while for STAT special surplus is released dollar for dollar once recoveries collected exceed the reinsurance premium.\nIn addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under U.S. STAT. U.S. GAAP generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.\n|\nRISK BASED CAPITAL\nThe Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose RBC requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. All of the Company's U.S. operating insurance \nsubsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations.\nSimilar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. All of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries expect to maintain capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.\n113\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n|\nSENSITIVITY\nIn any particular period, statutory capital amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending upon a variety of factors. The amount of change in the statutory capital or RBC ratios can vary based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. For further discussion on these factors, see MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management, Financial Risk on Statutory Capital.\nStatutory capital at the insurance subsidiaries has been maintained at capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired RBC ratios and ratings from rating agencies. The amount of statutory capital can increase or decrease depending on a number of factors affecting insurance results including, among other factors, the level of catastrophe claims incurred, the amount of reserve development, the effect of changes in interest rates on investment income and the discounting of loss reserves, and the effect of realized gains and losses on investments.\n|\nCONTINGENCIES\nLegal Proceedings\nFor a discussion regarding The Hartford’s legal proceedings, see the information contained in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 3 — Legal Proceedings, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nLegislative and Regulatory Developments\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has issued final rules to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures for investors. The SEC rules are being challenged in the courts, and on April 4, 2024 the SEC voluntarily stayed the rules pending judicial review. If they become operative in their current form, the rules will require extensive narrative and quantitative reporting on climate change and decarbonization in SEC filings and financial statements and pose potential compliance and regulatory risks to the Company, beginning in fiscal year 2025. The State of California has enacted laws that impose similarly extensive compliance burdens on the Company, entailing like compliance and regulatory risks. Other jurisdictions may follow suit. However, the California laws are facing legal challenges as well and the overall state of these types of climate related disclosure regimes, whether at the state or federal level, remains uncertain.\nCongress may consider a variety of proposals including a possible increase in the corporate tax rate to offset the cost of \nany new spending. Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives that may be considered by Congress and/or the U.S. Treasury Department could have a material effect on the Company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any such Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear.\nGuaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments\n \nFor a discussion regarding Guaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments, see Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nFor a discussion of accounting standards, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n114\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

Controls and Procedures\nItem 9A. \nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, based on their evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective for the purposes set forth in the definition thereof in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of December 31, 2024.\nMANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \nThe management of The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“The Hartford”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for The Hartford as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Hartford's management assessed its internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\n” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment under those criteria, The Hartford's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThere were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \nATTESTATION REPORT OF THE COMPANY'S REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nThe Hartford's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting which is set forth below.\n116\n|\nTable of Contents\nPart II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nThe Hartford Insurance Group, Inc.\nHartford, Connecticut\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) (formerly The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate\n.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 21, 2025\n117\n|\nTable of Contents\nPart II - Item 9B.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nUnpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Refer to Notes 1 and 10 to the financial statements \nCritical Audit Matter Description\nFor property and casualty and group life and disability insurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not reported and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. \nGiven the subjectivity of estimating the ultimate cost to settle the liabilities for reported and unreported claims due to uncertainties caused by various factors including frequency and severity of claims as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2024, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.\n122\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses included the following, among others: \n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses,\n \nincluding controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company's estimation processes.\n•\nWe tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s analysis, including historical claims.\n•\nWith the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by the Company to estimate the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses by:\n–\nAssessing the reasonableness of the Company’s analysis and, for selected reserving lines, developing independent estimates of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and comparing such estimates to the Company’s estimates.\n \n–\nComparing the Company’s prior year assumptions of expected development of ultimate loss to actual losses incurred during the current year to identify potential management bias in the determination of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.\n \nInvestments in Fixed Maturities Classified as Available-for-Sale - Refer to Notes 1, 4, and 5 to the financial statements \nCritical Audit Matter Description \nInvestments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value in the financial statements. Certain investments without readily determinable fair values were valued using significant unobservable inputs, such as credit spreads and interest rates beyond the observable curve, that involved considerable judgment by the Company. \nGiven the Company used models and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of certain investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale, performing audit procedures to evaluate these inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \nOur audit procedures related to the models and unobservable inputs used by the Company to estimate the fair value of certain investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale, including controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company’s estimation processes. \n•\nOn a sample basis, we tested the accuracy and completeness of the investments owned as of December 31, 2024, and the relevant security attributes used in the determination of their fair values.\n•\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, for a sample of investments, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the fair value calculation and developed independent estimates of the fair value and compared our estimates to the Company’s estimates. In addition to developing independent estimates, we obtained an understanding of the models and inputs used by the Company and assessed those models and inputs for reasonableness. Such assessment included comparing inputs to external sources or developing independent inputs.\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 21, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s

Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)\n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \nThe Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. (\"HIG\") is a holding company for insurance and financial services subsidiaries that provide property and casualty (\"P&C\") insurance, employee group benefits insurance and services and mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (\"ETF\") to individual and business customers in the United States as well as in the United Kingdom and other international locations (collectively, “The Hartford”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”). Previously known as The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., the Company changed its name to The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. on February 6, 2025.\nThe Hartford conducts business principally in \nfive\n reportable segments including Business Insurance (formerly \"Commercial Lines\"), Personal Insurance (formerly \"Personal Lines\"), Property & Casualty Other Operations, Employee Benefits (formerly \"Group Benefits\") and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) which differ materially from the accounting practices prescribed by various insurance regulatory authorities.\n \nConsolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc., and entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest. Entities in which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions but does not control are reported using the equity method. Intercompany transactions and balances between The Hartford and its subsidiaries and affiliates have been eliminated.\n \nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and \nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe most significant estimates include those used in determining property and casualty and group long-term disability (\"LTD\") insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance; evaluation of goodwill for impairment; valuation of investments and derivative instruments; and contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nSegment Disclosures\nO\nn \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the Company \nadopted\n the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) new guidance on \nSegment Reporting\n, that was applied on a retrospective basis for all periods presented. The new guidance requires enhanced disclosures on an annual and quarterly basis about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within the reported measure of segment profit or loss, as well as disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and a description of how the reported measure of profit or loss is used to assess segment performance and allocate resources. The Company has included the new disclosures in Note 3 - Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company will also provide the quarterly disclosures beginning with the March 31, 2025 interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The new guidance did not have an impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n129\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFuture Adoption of New Accounting Standards\nIncome Tax Disclosures\nThe FASB issued new disclosure requirements for income taxes primarily for the \nincome tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid\n. The income tax rate reconciliation within the income taxes note will present reconciling items based on specified categories with further disaggregation of items above a prescribed threshold. Disclosure of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) in the consolidated statement of cash flows will be disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes with further disaggregation by individual jurisdictions subject to a prescribed threshold. The Company is required to provide the new disclosure annually beginning with the \nDecember 31, 2025\n consolidated financial statements. Disclosures are required to be provided on a prospective basis with retrospective application permitted. The Company is evaluating the disclosure impact of the new guidance; however, the new guidance will not have an impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nDisaggregated Income Statement Expenses\nThe FASB issued new guidance on \ndisclosures of disaggregated income statement expenses\n. The new guidance requires footnote disclosures that will disaggregate expenses included in relevant expense captions into prescribed categories, as well as narrative disclosures about selling expenses. The Company is required to provide the new disclosures beginning with the \nDecember 31, 2027\n consolidated financial statements and on a quarterly basis beginning with the March 31, 2028 interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The new guidance will be applied on \na prospective basis\n, with retrospective application or early adoption permitted.  The Company is evaluating the disclosure impact of the new guidance; however, it will not have an impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition\nPremium Revenue from Direct Insurance and Assumed Reinsurance\nProperty and casualty premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period and include accruals for policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us, as well as ultimate premium revenue anticipated under auditable and retrospectively rated policies. We estimate the amount of premium not yet reported based on current and historical trends of the business being written. Such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year's results. Unearned premiums \nrepresent the premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force, or period of risk. \nGroup life, disability and accident premiums are generally due from policyholders, and recognized as revenue, on a pro rata basis over the period of the contracts.\nAn estimated ACL is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds and considering historical credit loss information, adjusted for current economic conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts when appropriate. The Company records total credit loss expenses related to premiums receivable in insurance operating costs and other expenses. Write-offs of premiums receivable and agents' balances and any related ACL are recorded in the period in which the balance is deemed uncollectible. Refer to Note 7 - Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances for further discussion regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts included in premiums receivable and agents’ balances.\nNon-Insurance Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nInstallment fees are charged on property and casualty insurance contracts for billing the insurance customer in installments over the policy term. These fees are recognized in fee income as earned on collection.\nInsurance servicing revenues within Personal Insurance consist of up-front commissions earned for collecting premiums and processing claims on insurance policies for which The Hartford does not assume underwriting risk, predominantly related to the National Flood Insurance Plan program. These insurance servicing revenues are recognized in other revenues over the period of the flood program's policy terms.\nEmployee Benefits earns fee income from employers for the administration of underwriting, implementation and claims processing for employer self-funded plans and for leave management services. Fees are recognized as services are provided and collected monthly.\nHartford Funds provides investment management, administrative and distribution services to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The Company assesses investment advisory, distribution and other asset management fees primarily based on the average daily net asset values from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which are recorded in the period in which the services are provided and are collected monthly. Fluctuations in domestic and international markets and related investment performance, volume and mix of sales and redemptions of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, and other changes to the composition of assets under management (\"AUM\") are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.\nCorporate investment management and other fees are primarily for managing third party invested assets. These fees, calculated based on the average quarterly net asset values, are recorded in the period in which the services are provided and are collected quarterly. Fluctuations in markets and interest rates and other changes to the composition of assets under management are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.\n130\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nDividends to Policyholders\nPolicyholder dividends are paid to certain property and casualty policyholders. Policies that receive dividends are referred to as participating policies. Participating dividends to policyholders are accrued and reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses and other liabilities using an estimate of the amount to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws.\nNet written premiums for participating property and casualty insurance policies represented \n6\n%, \n6\n%, and \n7\n% of total net written premiums for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Participating dividends to property and casualty policyholders were $\n39\n, $\n39\n and $\n29\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThere were \nno\n additional amounts of income allocated to participating policyholders.\nInvestments\nOverview\nThe Company’s investments in fixed maturities consist of bonds, including structured securities, and redeemable preferred stock. Most of these investments are classified as AFS and are carried at fair value. The after tax difference between fair value and cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. Fixed maturities for which the Company elected the fair value option are classified as FVO and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in net realized gains and losses. These investments represent certain investments in residual interests of securitizations and other securities that contain embedded credit derivatives. Equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net realized gains and losses. Mortgage loans are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of an ACL. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported at their carrying value and are primarily accounted for under the equity method with the Company’s share of earnings included in net investment income. Recognition of income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related financial information, as private equity and other funds are generally received on a three-month delay. Accordingly, income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 may not include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds, which are generally obtained from the limited partnerships. Other investments primarily consist of equity fund investments measured at fair value, overseas deposits which are measured at fair value using the net asset value as a practical expedient, consolidated investment funds for which the Company has provided seed money and reports the underlying investments at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in income consistent with accounting requirements \nfor investment companies, and derivative instruments which are carried at fair value.\nNet Realized Gains and Losses\nNet realized gains and losses from investment sales are reported as a component of revenues and are determined on a specific identification basis. Net realized gains and losses also result from fair value changes in equity securities, FVO securities, and derivatives contracts that do not qualify, or are not designated, as a hedge for accounting purposes. The Company records net credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS and changes in the ACL on mortgage loans as a component of net realized gains and losses. Future changes in the ACL resulting from improvements in expected future cash flows are recorded through net realized gains and losses.\nNet Investment Income\nInterest income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans is recognized when earned on the constant effective yield method based on the estimated timing of cash flows. Most premiums and discounts on fixed maturities are amortized to the maturity date. Premiums on callable bonds may be amortized to call dates based on call prices. For structured financial assets subject to prepayment risk, yields are recalculated and adjusted periodically to reflect historical and/or estimated future prepayments using the retrospective method. For certain other structured securities, including securities that previously had an ACL and interest only securities, any yield adjustments are made using the prospective method. Prepayment fees and make-whole payments on fixed maturities and mortgage loans are recorded in net investment income when earned. For equity securities, dividends are recognized as investment income on the ex-dividend date. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments primarily use the equity method of accounting to recognize the Company’s share of earnings. For fixed maturities with an ACL, net investment income is recognized at the original effective rate and accretion of the ACL is recognized through net realized gains and losses. The Company’s non-income producing investments were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nAccrued Investment Income\nAccrued investment income primarily includes accruals of interest and dividend income from investments that have been earned but not yet received.\nDerivative Instruments\nOverview\nThe Company utilizes a variety of over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives, derivatives cleared through central clearing houses (\"OTC-cleared\") and exchange traded derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to engage in income generation covered call transactions and replication transactions. The types of instruments may include swaps, \n131\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\ncaps, floors, forwards, futures and options to achieve the following Company-approved objectives: \n•\nto hedge risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rates or volatility; \n•\nto manage liquidity; \n•\nto control transaction costs; and\n•\nto enter into income generation covered call transactions and synthetic replication transactions.\nInterest rate and credit default swaps involve the periodic exchange of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals, calculated using agreed upon rates or other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Generally, little to no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.\nThe Company clears certain interest rate swap and credit default swap derivative transactions through central clearing houses. OTC-cleared derivatives require initial collateral at the inception of the trade in the form of cash or highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and government agency investments. Central clearing houses also require additional cash as variation margin based on daily market value movements. For information on collateral, see the Derivative Collateral Arrangements section in Note 6 - Derivatives. In addition, OTC-cleared transactions include price alignment amounts either received or paid on the variation margin, which is characterized as interest and reflected in net investment income. \nForward contracts are customized commitments that specify a rate of interest or currency exchange rate to be paid or received on an obligation beginning on a future start date and are typically settled in cash.\nFinancial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities or cash, and changes in the futures’ contract values are settled daily in cash.\nOption contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. The contracts may reference commodities, which grant the purchaser the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer commodities at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. Option contracts are typically settled in cash.\nForeign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.\nThe Company’s derivative transactions conducted in insurance company subsidiaries are used in strategies permitted under the \nderivative use plans required by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and the State of New York insurance regulators.\nAccounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nDerivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in \nOther Investments and Other Liabilities\n. For balance sheet presentation purposes, the Company has elected to offset the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset.\nOn the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment” hedge) or (4) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company currently does not designate any derivatives as fair value or net investment hedges.\nCash Flow Hedges\n - \nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, including foreign-currency cash flow hedges, are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Cash flows from cash flow hedges are presented in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \nOther Investment and/or Risk Management Activities\n - \nThe Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used to reduce economic risk or replicate permitted investments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net realized gains and losses.\nHedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing\nTo qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation process includes linking derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges to \n132\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nspecific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness testing methods to be used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values, cash flows or net investment in foreign operations of hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is assessed primarily using quantitative methods as well as using qualitative methods. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item.\nDiscontinuance of Hedge Accounting\nThe Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the qualifying criteria are no longer met; (2) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\nWhen cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings.\nIn other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the hedged item.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nThe Company may purchase investments that contain embedded derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized gains and losses.\nCredit Risk of Derivative Instruments\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The Company generally requires that OTC derivative contracts, other than certain forward contracts, be governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which are structured by legal entity and by counterparty, and permit right of offset. Some agreements require \ndaily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is \npledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds, if applicable. The Co\nmpany also minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management. OTC-cleared derivatives are governed by clearing house rules. Transactions cleared through a central clearing house reduce risk due to their ability to require daily variation margin and act as an independent valuation source. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.\nCash and Restricted Cash\nCash represents cash on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions. Restrictions on cash primarily relate to funds that are held to support regulatory and contractual obligations.\nReinsurance\nThe Company cedes insurance to other insurers in order to limit its maximum losses, to diversify its exposures and provide statutory surplus relief. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company also assumes reinsurance from other insurers and is a member of and participates in reinsurance pools and associations. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Company’s acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies or pools have underwritten.\nReinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (i.e., risk transfer). To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance agreement must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss to the reinsurer. If the ceded and assumed transactions do not meet risk transfer requirements, the Company accounts for these transactions as deposit transactions. The Company had \nno\n deposit liability as of December 31, 2024 or and 2023 reported in other liabilities.\nPremiums, benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the net effects of ceded and assumed reinsurance transactions. Included in other assets are prepaid reinsurance premiums, which represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired terms of the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance recoverables are balances due from reinsurers for ceded paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Changes in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reported in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of its reinsurance recoverable assets and establishes an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The allowance for \n133\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nuncollectible reinsurance comprises an ACL and an allowance for disputed balances. Based on this analysis, the Company may adjust the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance or charge off reinsurer balances that are determined to be uncollectible. The Company records credit losses related to reinsurance recoverables in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses. Write-offs of reinsurance recoverables and any related ACL are recorded in the period in which the balance is deemed uncollectible. Expected recoveries are included in the estimate of the ACL. \nRetroactive reinsurance agreements, including adverse development covers (\"ADC\"), are reinsurance agreements under which our reinsurer agrees to reimburse us as a result of loss development related to past insurable events. For these agreements, the consideration paid in excess of the estimated ultimate losses to be recovered under the agreement at inception is recognized as a loss on reinsurance transaction. The benefit of subsequent adverse development ceded up to the total consideration paid is recognized as ceded losses, which are a reduction of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. The excess of the estimated amounts ultimately to be recovered under the agreement over the consideration paid is recognized as a deferred gain liability and amortized into income over the period the ceded losses are recovered in cash from the reinsurer. The amount of the deferred gain liability is recalculated each period based on cumulative recoveries not yet collected relative to the latest estimate of ultimate losses to be recovered. Ceded loss reserves under retroactive agreements were $\n1.6\n billion and $\n1.7\n billion, and the deferred gain liability reported in other liabilities was $\n914\n and $\n997\n, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In any given period, the change in deferred gain included in net income includes amortization of the deferred gain based on the percentage of ultimate ceded losses collected plus any change in the deferred gain liability due to changes in the estimated ultimate losses to be recovered. The effect on income from change in the deferred gain was a net charge or (benefit) to earnings of $(\n83\n), $\n194\n and $\n229\n before tax for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.\n \nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nDAC represents costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts and incremental direct costs of contract acquisition that are incurred in transactions with independent third parties or in compensation to employees. Such costs primarily include commissions, premium taxes, costs and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully issued contracts, including a portion of policy issuance and underwriting costs.\nFor P&C insurance products and group life, disability and accident contracts, costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, and if not, are charged to expense. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of DAC.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A deferred tax provision is recorded for the tax effects of temporary differences between the Company's current taxable income and its income before tax under generally accepted accounting principles in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For deferred tax assets, the Company records a valuation allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost to acquire a business over the acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. Goodwill is impaired up to the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company’s reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated consist of Business Insurance, Personal Insurance, Employee Benefits, and Hartford Funds. \nManagement’s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations, including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Assumptions include levels of economic capital required to support the business, future business growth, earnings projections, the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting and, for the Hartford Funds segment, assets under management. Decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit’s fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairments.\nIntangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include purchased customer relationship and agency or other distribution rights and licenses measured at fair value at acquisition. The Company amortizes finite-lived other intangible assets over their useful lives generally on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit, ranging from \n1\n to \n15\n years. Management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment generally when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangibles. Finite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the \n134\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\ncarrying amount exceeds fair value. Impaired intangible assets are written down to fair value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, which includes capitalized software and right-of-use lease assets, is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment and is recognized principally on the straight-line method. Accumulated depreciation was $\n2.5\n billion and $\n2.4\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Depreciation expense was $\n177\n, $\n204\n, and $\n213\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses. The costs to access and develop hosted software arrangements, where The Hartford has the right to access and use the software, but not take possession, and the cost of certain software licenses are reported in other assets on a straight-line basis over the service period. Amortization of hosted software and certain software licenses was $\n108\n, $\n85\n, and $\n78\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and is reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses.\nLeases\nLeases are classified as financing or operating leases. Where the lease is economically similar to a purchase because The Hartford obtains control of the underlying asset, the lease is classified as a financing lease and the Company recognizes amortization of the right of use asset and interest expense on the liability. Where the lease is not economically similar to a purchase as the lease provides The Hartford with only the right to control the use of the underlying asset over the lease term and the lease term is greater than one year, the lease is an operating lease and the lease cost is recognized as rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Leases with a term of one year or less are also expensed over the lease term but not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nUnpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nFor property and casualty and group life, disability and accident insurance and assumed reinsurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have not yet been reported, and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future losses and loss adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events, and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. In addition, a number of complex factors influence the uncertainties involved with the reserving process including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until \nwell into the future. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by reserve line within the various reportable segments. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.\nMost of the Company’s property and casualty insurance products reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has discounted to present value certain reserves for indemnity payments that are due to claimants under workers’ compensation policies because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rate is based on the risk free rate for the expected claim duration as determined in the year the claims were incurred. The Company also has discounted liabilities for structured settlement agreements that provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. These structured settlements include annuities purchased to fund unpaid losses for permanently disabled claimants. These structured settlement liabilities are discounted to present value using the rate implicit in the purchased annuities and the purchased annuities are accounted for within reinsurance recoverables.\nGroup life and disability contracts with long-tail claim liabilities are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rates are estimated based on investment yields expected to be earned on the cash flows net of investment expenses and expected credit losses. The Company establishes discount rates for these reserves in the year the claims are incurred (the incurral year) which is when the estimated settlement pattern is determined. The discount rate for life and disability reserves acquired from Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business were based on interest rates in effect at the acquisition date of November 1, 2017.\nFor further information about how unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are established, see Note 10 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\nReserve for Future Policy Benefits\nThe Company’s reserves for future policy benefits includes paid-up life insurance and whole-life policies resulting from conversion from group life policies included within the Employee Benefits segment and reserves for run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities, which are reported in the Corporate category. \nContracts are grouped into cohorts by contract type and issue year. The Company establishes reserves for future policy benefits using the net premium approach, which represents the present value of future policyholder benefits and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Net premiums are calculated by multiplying gross premiums for the contracts in a specific cohort by a net premium ratio. The net premium ratio is determined for the lifetime of a given cohort as the present value of net benefits divided by the present value of gross premiums. Related expenses include termination and settlement costs and exclude acquisition costs and non-claim related costs, such as costs relating to investments, general administration, policy maintenance, product development, \n135\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nmarket research and general overhead or any other costs, which are expensed as incurred. \nThe Company estimates premiums, benefits and related expense cash flows using methods that include assumptions, such as estimates of mortality, lapse, and claim-related expenses, and the possible impact of inflation on those expenses. Benefits include all guaranteed cash flows to be paid to the policyholder. \nThe reserve for future policy benefits is adjusted for differences between actual and expected experience. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimates of cash flows expected over the life of a group of contracts using actual historical experience. These updated cash flows are used to calculate the revised net premiums and net premium ratio, which are used to derive an updated reserve for future policy benefits. In subsequent periods, the revised net premiums are used to measure the reserve for future policy benefits, subject to future revisions. Future cash flow assumptions, including mortality, lapse and expense are reviewed and, if a change is indicated, updated at least annually in the third quarter. \nThe difference between the newly calculated reserve balance and the reserve balance before updating for actual experience and/or future cash flow assumptions is the remeasurement gain or loss, which is immaterial for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and is presented in benefits losses and loss adjustments expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes to the reserve due to updates to cash flow assumptions, discounted at the discount rate used when each annual cohort was established, are recognized on a catch-up basis in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \nThe discount rate assumption is an equivalent single rate that is based on a current market observable, upper-medium grade fixed maturity yield. This has been interpreted to represent a yield based on single-A credit rated fixed maturity instruments with similar duration to the liability. The Company uses the yield of a market observable index of single-A credit rated fixed maturities as the basis for setting the discount rate. The discount rate assumption is updated quarterly and the change in the reserve estimate resulting from updating the discount rate assumption is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock is the cost of common stock repurchased, which includes the purchase price of shares acquired and direct costs to acquire shares, including commissions and excise taxes. Issuance and retirement of treasury stock is recognized at the average cost of shares held in treasury.\nForeign Currency\nForeign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The national currencies of the international operations are generally their functional currencies; however, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Lloyd's Syndicate 1221 (\"Lloyd's Syndicate\"), for which the Company is the sole corporate member. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are reflected in earnings in net realized gains (losses) in the period in which they occur.\n2.

Contingently issuable shares are included for the number of shares issuable assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period, if dilutive.\n136\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 - Segment Information\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company currently conducts business principally in \nfive\n reportable segments including Business Insurance, Personal Insurance, Property & Casualty Other Operations, Employee Benefits and Hartford Funds, as well as a Corporate category. The reportable segments are described below and align with the Company’s key product and service offerings. \nOver 95% of the Company’s revenues are generated in the United States (“U.S.”). The remaining revenues are generated in the U.K. and other international locations.\nWe report our results of operations consistent with the manner in which our CODM reviews the busin\ness, \nassesses performance, and makes operating decisions on the allocation of resources to each reportable segment. The CODM considers actual results and budget-to-actual variances when assessing segment performance and making decisions on the allocation of resources to each segment. The Company’s CODM is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.   \nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has identified GAAP net income as the reported measure of segment profit or loss.\nThe Company’s reportable segments, as well as the Corporate category, are as follows:\nBusiness Insurance\nBusiness Insurance provides a variety of insurance products and risk management services in the U.S. and internationally to commercial enterprises of varying sizes, with insurance coverages including workers’ compensation, property, automobile, general liability, umbrella, package business, professional liability, bond, marine, livestock, accident and health, and assumed reinsurance.\nPersonal Insurance\nPersonal Insurance provides standard automobile, homeowners and personal umbrella coverages to individuals across the U.S., including a special program designed exclusively for members of AARP through an agreement that is in place through December 31, 2032.\nProperty & Casualty Other Operations\nP&C Other Operations includes certain property and casualty operations, managed by the Company, that have discontinued \nwriting new business and includes substantially all of the Company’s asbestos and environmental (\"A&E\") exposures.\nEmployee Benefits\nEmployee Benefits provides employers and associations with group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products and services, including voluntary benefits, and group retiree health.\nHartford Funds\nHartford Funds offers investment products for retail and retirement accounts and provides investment management, distribution and administrative services such as product design, implementation and oversight. This business also manages a portion of the mutual funds which support third-party life and annuity separate accounts.\nCorporate\nThe Company includes in the Corporate category capital raising activities (including equity financing, debt financing and related interest expense), purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill, reserves for run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities, restructuring costs, transaction expenses incurred in connection with an acquisition, certain M&A costs, and other expenses not allocated to the reportable segments. Interest expense of $\n199\n, $\n199\n and $\n213\n, on debt for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, is included in the Corporate category. Corporate also includes investment management fees and expenses related to managing third party assets.\nFinancial Measures and Other Segment Information\nCertain transactions between segments occur during the year that primarily relate to tax settlements, insurance coverage, expense reimbursements, services provided, investment transfers and capital contributions. In addition, certain inter-segment transactions occur that relate to interest income on allocated surplus. Consolidated net income is unaffected by such transactions.\n137\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 - Segment Information\nTHE HARTFORD INSURANCE GROUP, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nSegment Revenues\n \nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBusiness Insurance\nWorkers’ compensation\n$\n3,691\n \n$\n3,670\n \n$\n3,499\n \nGeneral liability\n2,218\n \n1,977\n \n1,836\n \nMarine\n278\n \n256\n \n235\n \nPackage business\n2,331\n \n2,076\n \n1,844\n \nCommercial property\n1,258\n \n1,053\n \n845\n \nProfessional Liability\n824\n \n787\n \n737\n \nBond\n327\n \n321\n \n303\n \nAssumed reinsurance\n758\n \n615\n \n467\n \nCommercial automobile\n1,079\n \n927\n \n844\n \nBusiness Insurance earned premium and fee income\n12,764\n \n11,682\n \n10,610\n \nNet investment income\n1,714\n \n1,532\n \n1,415\n \nNet realized losses\n(\n73\n)\n(\n156\n)\n(\n385\n)\nOther revenue [1]\n1\n \n1\n \n(\n1\n)\nTotal Business Insurance\n14,406\n \n13,059\n \n11,639\n \nPersonal Insurance\n \n \n \nPersonal automobile\n2,425\n \n2,156\n \n2,047\n \nHomeowners\n1,061\n \n961\n \n932\n \nPersonal Insurance earned premium and fee income [2]\n3,486\n \n3,117\n \n2,979\n \nNet investment income\n222\n \n171\n \n140\n \nNet realized losses\n(\n14\n)\n(\n16\n)\n(\n35\n)\nOther revenue\n85\n \n81\n \n73\n \nTotal Personal Insurance\n3,779\n \n3,353\n \n3,157\n \nP&C Other Operations\nNet investment income\n74\n \n69\n \n63\n \nNet realized losses\n(\n4\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n16\n)\nTotal P&C Other Operations\n70\n \n62\n \n47\n \nEmployee Benefits\n \n \n \nGroup disability\n3,576\n \n3,530\n \n3,310\n \nGroup life\n2,617\n \n2,583\n \n2,393\n \nOther\n422\n \n402\n \n354\n \nEmployee Benefits premium and other considerations\n6,615\n \n6,515\n \n6,057\n \nNet investment income\n475\n \n469\n \n524\n \nNet realized losses\n(\n24\n)\n(\n45\n)\n(\n122\n)\nTotal Employee Benefits\n7,066\n \n6,939\n \n6,459\n \nHartford Funds\nMutual fund and ETF\n960\n \n900\n \n964\n \nThird-party life and annuity separate accounts [3]\n75\n \n73\n \n80\n \nHartford Funds fee income\n1,035\n \n973\n \n1,044\n \nNet investment income\n20\n \n17\n \n9\n \nNet realized gains (losses)\n12\n \n10\n \n(\n24\n)\nTotal Hartford Funds\n1,067\n \n1,000\n \n1,029\n \nTotal segment revenues\n$\n26,388\n \n$\n24,413\n \n$\n22,331\n \n[1]\nOther revenues for Business Insurance includes revenues from equity method investments that are not considered revenues from contracts with customers in the table below. \n[2]\nFor 2024, 2023 and 2022, AARP members accounted for earned premiums of $\n3.2\n billion, $\n2.9\n billion and $\n2.7\n billion, respectively.\n[3]\nRepresents revenues earned for investment advisory services on third party life and annuity separate account AUM by the Company's Hartford Funds segment.\n \n138\n|\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 -

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n|\nFINANCIAL RISK\nFinancial risks include direct and indirect risks to the Company's financial objectives from events that impact financial market conditions and the value of financial assets. Some events may cause correlated movement in multiple risk factors. The primary sources of financial risks are the Company's invested assets. \nConsistent with its risk appetite, the Company establishes financial risk limits to control potential loss on a U.S. GAAP, statutory, and economic basis. Exposures are actively monitored and managed, with risks mitigated where appropriate. The Company uses various risk management strategies, including limiting aggregation of risk, portfolio re-balancing and hedging with OTC and exchange-traded derivatives with counterparties meeting the appropriate regulatory and due diligence requirements. Derivatives may be used to achieve the following Company-approved objectives: (1) hedging risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; (2) managing liquidity; (3) controlling transaction costs; and (4) engaging in income generation covered call transactions and synthetic replication transactions. Derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management. The Company identifies different categories of financial risk, including liquidity, credit, interest rate, equity, and foreign currency exchange.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings or capital arising from the Company's inability or perceived inability to meet its contractual funding obligations as they come due.\nSources of Liquidity Risk \nSources of liquidity risk include funding risk, company-specific liquidity risk and market liquidity risk resulting from differences in the amount and timing of sources and uses of cash as well as company-specific and general market conditions. Stressed market conditions may impact the ability to sell assets or otherwise transact business and may result in a significant loss in value of the investment portfolio.\nImpact\n \nInadequate capital resources and liquidity could negatively affect the Company’s overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows from its businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.\nManagement\n The Company has defined ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to assess liquidity across the enterprise under both current and stressed market conditions. The Company measures and manages liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within prescribed limits across legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory and operational limitations to the transferability of liquid assets among legal entities. The Company also monitors internal and external conditions, and identifies material risk changes and emerging risks that may impact operating cash flows or liquid assets. The liquidity requirements of The Hartford Insurance Group, Inc. (\"HIG Holding Company\") have been and will continue to be met by the HIG Holding Company's fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash, and dividends from \nits subsidiaries, principally from its insurance operations, as well as the issuance of common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from its credit facilities as needed. The Company maintains multiple sources of contingent liquidity including a revolving credit facility, an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HIG Holding Company and certain affiliates, and access to collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (\"FHLBB\") for certain affiliates. The Company's CFO has primary responsibility for liquidity risk.\nCredit Risk and Counterparty Risk\nCredit risk is the risk to earnings or capital due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with contractually agreed upon terms. Credit risk is comprised of three major factors: the risk of change in credit quality, or credit migration risk; the risk of default; and the risk of a change in value due to changes in credit spreads.\nSources of Credit Risk \nThe majority of the Company’s credit risk is concentrated in its investment holdings and use of derivatives, but it is also present in the Company’s ceded reinsurance activities, bond insurance, and certain aspects of Business Insurance products.\nImpact\n A decline in creditworthiness is typically reflected as an increase in an investment’s credit spread and an associated decline in the investment's fair value, potentially resulting in recording an ACL and an increased probability of a realized loss upon sale. In certain instances, counterparties may default on their obligations and the Company may realize a loss on default. Premiums receivable, including premiums for retrospectively rated plans, reinsurance recoverable and deductible losses recoverable are also subject to credit risk based on the counterparty’s inability to pay.\nManagement\n The objective of the Company’s enterprise credit risk management strategy is to identify, quantify, and manage credit risk in aggregate and to limit potential losses in accordance with the Company's credit risk management policy. The Company manages its credit risk by managing aggregations of risk, holding a diversified mix of issuers and counterparties across its investment, reinsurance, and insurance portfolios, and limiting exposure to any specific reinsurer or counterparty. Potential credit losses can be mitigated through diversification (e.g., geographic regions, asset types, industry sectors), hedging and the use of collateral to reduce net credit exposure.\nThe Company manages credit risk through the use of various surveillance, analyses and governance processes. The investment and reinsurance areas have formal policies and procedures for counterparty approvals and authorizations, which establish criteria defining minimum levels of creditworthiness and financial stability for eligible counterparties. Potential investments are subject to underwriting reviews and management approval. Mitigation strategies vary across the three sources of credit risk, but may include:\n•\nInvesting in a portfolio of high-quality and diverse securities; \n•\nSelling investments subject to heightened credit risk;\n•\nHedging through use of credit default swaps;\n93\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n•\nClearing derivative transactions through central clearing houses that require daily variation margin;\n•\nEntering into derivative and reinsurance contracts only with strong creditworthy institutions;\n•\nRequiring collateral; and\n•\nNon-renewing policies/contracts or reinsurance treaties.\nThe Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Aggregate counterparty credit quality and exposure are monitored on a daily basis utilizing an enterprise-wide credit exposure information system that contains data on issuers, ratings, exposures, and credit limits. Exposures are tracked on a current and potential basis and aggregated by ultimate parent of the counterparty across investments, reinsurance receivables, insurance products with credit risk, and derivatives. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer or counterparty greater than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies. For further discussion of concentration of credit risk in the investment portfolio, see the Concentration of Credit Risk section in Note 5 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAssets and Liabilities Subject to Credit Risk\nInvestments\n \nEssentially all of the Company's invested assets are subject to credit risk. In 2024, there were net credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS of $2 and a net credit loss reversal on mortgage loans of $3. In 2023, there were net credit losses on fixed maturities, AFS and an increase in the ACL on mortgage loans of $14 and $15, respectively. Refer to the Investment Portfolio Risk section of Financial Risk Management under “Credit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Intent-to-Sell Impairments\" and \"ACL on Mortgage Loans”.\nReinsurance recoverables\n Reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, were $7,140 and $7,104 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively. Refer to the Enterprise Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Reinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy”.\nBond insurance\n The Company collects premiums and holds reserves for risk exposures within the bond insurance business where the Company guarantees the completion of our insured's financial or performance obligations in the event of a default on their contractual obligations. The Company manages this risk through underwriting risk assessment, collateral requirements for insureds, claims management, and reinsurance.\nPremiums receivable and agents' balances\n Premiums receivable and agents’ balances, net of an ACL, were $5,998 and $5,607, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For a discussion regarding collectibility of these balances, see Note 7 - Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk of Derivatives\nThe Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction.\nDowngrades to the credit ratings of the Company’s insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives. In some cases, downgrades may give derivative counterparties for OTC derivatives and clearing brokers for OTC-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. In addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require additional collateralization before entering into any new trades.\nManaging the Credit Risk of Counterparties to Derivative Instruments\nThe Company also has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The Company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company’s policies with respect to derivative counterparty exposure establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the \n94\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ncounterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management.\nThe Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better. The Company also generally requires that OTC derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\"ISDA\") Master Agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. The Company enters into credit support annexes in conjunction with the ISDA agreements, which require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. \nThe Company’s credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s net fair value, including income accruals, of all derivative positions transacted with a single counterparty for each separate legal entity. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not necessarily reflective of credit risk. The Company enters into collateral arrangements in connection with its derivatives positions and collateral is pledged to or held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the exposure is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds, if applicable. In accordance with industry standards and the contractual requirements, collateral is typically settled on the same business day. For further discussion, see the Derivative Commitments section of Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Credit Derivatives\nThe Company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield.\nCredit Risk Reduced Through Credit Derivatives\nThe Company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity or referenced index. The Company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company did not hold credit derivatives that purchase credit protection. \nCredit Risk Assumed Through Credit Derivatives\nThe Company may also enter into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not hold credit default swaps that assume credit risk.\nFor further information on credit derivatives, see Note 6 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk of Business Operations\nA portion of the Company's Business Insurance business is written with large deductibles or under retrospectively-rated plans. Under some commercial insurance contracts with a large deductible, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim and the Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. As such, the Company is subject to credit risk until reimbursement \nis made. Retrospectively-rated policies are utilized primarily for workers' compensation coverage, whereby the ultimate premium is adjusted based on actual losses incurred. Although the premium adjustment feature of a retrospectively-rated policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it presents credit risk to the Company. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant portion of such policyholders failed to reimburse the Company for the deductible amount or the amount of additional premium owed under retrospectively-rated policies. The Company manages these credit risks through credit analysis, collateral requirements, and oversight. For more information, see Note 7- Premiums Receivable and Agents' Balances of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk encompasses exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. Interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads.\nSources of Interest Rate Risk \nThe Company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from investments in fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans, issuances by the Company of debt securities, preferred stock and similar securities, discount rate assumptions associated with the Company’s claim reserves and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, and assets that support the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nImpact\n Changes in interest rates from current levels can have both favorable and unfavorable effects for the Company.\nChange in Interest Rates\nFavorable Effects\nUnfavorable Effects\nÝ\n•\nAdditional net investment income due to reinvesting at higher yields and higher yields on variable rate securities\n•\nDecrease in the fair value of the fixed income investment portfolio\nÞ\n•\nIncrease in the fair value of the fixed income investment portfolio\n•\nLower net investment income due to reinvesting at lower yields and lower yields on variable rate securities\n•\nAcceleration in paydowns and prepayments or calls of certain mortgage-backed and municipal securities\nManagement\n The Company primarily manages its exposure to interest rate risk by constructing investment portfolios that seek to protect the Company from the economic impact associated with changes in interest rates by setting portfolio duration targets that are aligned with the duration of the \n95\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nliabilities that they support. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models and cash flow simulation under various market scenarios of the liabilities and their supporting investment portfolios. Key metrics that the Company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and the associated liabilities include duration, convexity and key rate duration. \nThe Company may also use interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, futures to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its investment portfolio or liabilities and to manage portfolio duration. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. The use of such swaps enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to desired objectives and manage the duration profile within established tolerances. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk, including offsetting positions, totaled $4.6 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively, and primarily relate to hedging invested assets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of these derivatives was $0 and $(6), respectively. \nAssets and Liabilities Subject to Interest Rate Risk\nFixed income investments\n The fair value of fixed income investments, which include fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, and short-term investments, was $53.3 billion and $50.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average duration of the portfolio, including derivative instruments, was approximately 3.8 for both periods. Changes in the fair value of fixed maturities due to changes in interest rates are reflected as a component of AOCI.\nLong-term debt obligations\n The Company's variable rate debt obligations will generally result in increased interest expense as a result of higher interest rates; the inverse is true during a declining interest rate environment. However, as explained in Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has entered into an interest-rate swap agreement to effectively convert variable interest rate payments on its $500 junior subordinated debentures due 2067 to fixed interest payments. Changes in the value of fixed rate long-term debt as a result of changes in interest rates will impact the fair value of these instruments but not the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGroup life and disability product liabilities\n The cash outflows associated with contracts issued by the Company's Employee Benefits segment, primarily group life and short and long-term disability policy liabilities, are not interest rate sensitive but vary based on timing. Though the aggregate cash flow payment streams are relatively predictable, these products rely upon actuarial pricing assumptions (including mortality and morbidity) and have an element of cash flow uncertainty. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $8,496 and $8,586, respectively of reserves for group life and disability contracts. For most Employee Benefits liabilities, changes in interest rates will impact the fair value but not the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. For long-duration insurance contracts, including paid-up life and life conversions, changes in interest rates will impact both the fair value and the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPension and other postretirement benefit obligations\n The Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are exposed to interest rate risk based upon the sensitivity of present value obligations to changes in liability discount rates as well as the sensitivity of the fair value of investments in the plan portfolios to changes in interest rates. The discount rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve that reflects high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows. The Company is exposed to the risk of having to make additional plan contributions if the plans’ investment returns, including from investments in fixed maturities, are lower than expected. For further discussion of discounting pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, refer to Note 18 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nGroup Life and Disability Reserves and Invested Assets Supporting Them\nIncluded in the following table is the before tax change in the net economic value of contracts issued by the Company’s Employee Benefits segment, primarily group life and disability, for which fixed valuation discount rate assumptions are established based upon investment returns assumed in pricing, along with the corresponding invested assets. For long-duration insurance contracts the discount rate is updated quarterly with an equivalent single rate that is based on a current market observable, upper-medium grade fixed maturity yield. This has been interpreted to represent a yield based on single-A credit \n96\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nrated fixed maturity instruments with similar duration to the related liability. Also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by the Company to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the investment portfolios supporting these contracts. This analysis does not include the assets and corresponding liabilities of other insurance products such as automobile, property, workers' compensation and general liability insurance. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments. The calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in net economic value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.\nThe selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated below due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. The Company’s sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity of Employee Benefits Reserves and Invested Assets Supporting Them\nChange in Net Economic Value as of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nBasis point shift\n-100 \n+100\n-100\n+100\nIncrease (decrease) in economic value, before tax \n$\n69 \n$\n(57)\n$\n64 \n$\n(50)\nThe carrying value of assets related to supporting Employee Benefits, primarily long-term disability reserves, was $10.0 billion and $10.3 billion, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and included fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments. The assets are monitored and managed within set duration guidelines and are evaluated on a daily basis, as well as annually, using scenario simulation techniques in compliance with regulatory requirements.\nInvested Assets not Supporting Group Life and Disability Reserves \nThe following table provides an analysis showing the estimated before tax change in the fair value of the Company’s investments and related derivatives, excluding assets supporting group life and disability reserves which are included in the table above, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity of Invested Assets (Excluding Those Supporting Employee Benefits Reserves)\nChange in Fair Value as of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nBasis point shift\n-100 \n+100 \n-100\n+100\nIncrease (decrease) in fair value, before tax \n$\n1,758 \n$\n(1,627)\n$\n1,590 \n$\n(1,466)\nThe carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments, excluding those related to supporting Employee Benefits short and long-term disability reserves, was $43.3 billion and $39.8 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLong-term Debt\nA 100 basis point parallel decrease in the yield curve would result in an increase in the fair value of long-term debt by $397 and $444 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A 100 basis point parallel increase in the yield curve would result in a decrease in the fair value of long-term debt by $336 and $373 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in the value of long-term debt as a result of changes in interest rates will not impact the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nPension and Other Postretirement Plan Obligations\nA 100 basis point parallel decrease in the yield curve would impact both the value of the underlying pension assets and the value of the liabilities, resulting in an increase in the unfunded liabilities (or decrease in asset) for pension and other postretirement plan obligations of $9 and $12 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A 100 basis point parallel increase in the yield curve would have the inverse effect and result in a decrease in the unfunded liabilities (or increase in assets) for pension and other postretirement plan obligations of $3 and $3 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gains or losses due to changes in the yield curve on the pension and postretirement plan obligations are recorded within AOCI and are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold.\nEquity Risk\nEquity risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of global equities or equity indices. \nSources of Equity Risk \nThe Company has exposure to equity risk from invested assets, assets that support the \n97\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCompany’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and fee income derived from Hartford Funds AUM.\nImpact\n \nThe investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities and derivatives, which could negatively impact the Company's reported earnings. In addition, investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments generally have a level of correlation to domestic equity market levels and can expose the Company to losses in earnings if valuations decline; however, earnings impacts are recognized on a lag as results from private equity investments and other funds are generally reported on a three-month delay. For assets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. Hartford Funds earnings are also significantly influenced by the U.S. and other equity markets. Generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of average daily AUM and the amount of fee income generated from those assets. Increases in equity markets will generally have the inverse impact. \nManagement\n The Company uses various approaches in managing its equity exposure, including limits on the proportion of assets invested in equities, diversification of the equity portfolio, and, at times, hedging of changes in equity indices. For assets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. In order to minimize risk, the pension plans maintain a listing of permissible and prohibited investments and impose concentration limits and investment quality requirements on permissible investment options.\nAssets and Liabilities Subject to Equity Risk \nInvestment portfolio\n The investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities and derivatives, as well as limited partnerships and other alternative investments. Generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of these types of investments and could negatively impact the Company’s earnings while increases in equity will have the inverse impact. For equity securities, the changes in fair value are reported in net realized gains and losses. For limited partnerships and other alternative investments, the Company's share of earnings for the period is recorded in net investment income, though typically on a delay based on the availability of the underlying financial statements. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below.\nAssets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans\n The Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below. \nDeclines in value are recognized as unrealized losses in AOCI. Increases in equity markets are recognized as unrealized gains in AOCI. Unrealized gains and losses in AOCI are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold. For further discussion of equity risk associated with the pension plans, see Note 18 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAssets under management\n AUM in Hartford Funds may decrease in value during equity market declines, which would result in lower earnings because fee income is earned based upon the value of AUM.\nEquity Sensitivity\nInvestment portfolio and the assets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans\nIncluded in the following tables are the estimated before tax change in the economic value of the Company’s invested assets and assets supporting pension and other postretirement benefit plans with sensitivity to equity risk. The calculation of the hypothetical change in economic value below assumes a 20% upward and downward shock to the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Price Index (\"S&P 500\"). For limited partnerships and other alternative investments, the movement in economic value is calculated using a beta analysis largely derived from historical experience relative to the S&P 500.\nThe selection of the 20% shock to the S&P 500 was made only as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated below due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. These calculations do not capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations. \n98\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

If equity markets were to hypothetically decline 20% and remain depressed for one year, the estimated before tax impact on reported Hartford Funds earnings for that one year period is approximately $70 as of December 31, 2024. The selection of the 20% shock to the S&P 500 was made only as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nForeign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies.\nSources of Currency Risk \nThe Company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-U.S. dollar denominated cash, fixed maturities, equities, and derivative instruments. In addition, the Company has non-U.S. subsidiaries, some with functional currencies other than U.S. dollar, and which transact business in multiple currencies resulting in assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\nImpact \nChanges in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities. The impact on the fair value of fixed maturities, AFS due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in relation to functional currency, is reported in unrealized gains or losses as part of other comprehensive income (\"OCI\"). The realization of gains or losses resulting from investment sales or from changes in investments that record changes in fair value through the income statement due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is reflected through net realized gains and losses.\nIn regard to insurance and reinsurance contracts that the Company enters into for which we are obligated to pay losses in a foreign currency, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities related to these contracts is reflected through net realized gains and losses. These assets or liabilities include, but are not limited to, cash and cash equivalents, premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables, and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Additionally, the Company translates the assets, liabilities, and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities into U.S. dollars. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income.\nManagement\n \nThe Company manages its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through asset-liability matching and through the use of derivative instruments. However, legal entity capital is invested in local currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations. The foreign currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using foreign currency swaps and forwards.\nAssets and Liabilities Subject to Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\nInvestment portfolio\n The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk affecting non-U.S. dollar denominated cash, fixed maturities, equities, and derivative instruments. Changes in relative values between currencies can positively or negatively impact net realized gains and losses or unrealized gains (losses) as part of other comprehensive income.\nInsurance contract related assets and liabilities \nThe Company has non-U.S. dollar denominated insurance and reinsurance contracts and associated premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, that are exposed to foreign exchange risk. For contracts that are within U.S dollar functional currency legal entities, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can positively or negatively impact net realized gains and losses. For contracts within non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities, changes in the functional currency relative to the U.S. dollar can positively or negatively impact other comprehensive income.\nForeign Currency Sensitivity\nFor the Company’s primary currencies that create foreign exchange risk, the following table provides the estimated impact of a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates. Actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. The amounts presented are in U.S. dollars and before tax. \n99\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

At times, the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. Factors include:\n•\nA decrease in the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, due in part to credit spreads widening, an increase in interest rates, or a decline in equity market levels, may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and RBC ratios;\n•\nA decline in investment yields may reduce our net investment income, which may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and RBC ratios;\n•\nDecreases in the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, may reduce statutory surplus and RBC ratios; and\n•\nNon-market factors can also impact the amount and volatility of either our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and RBC ratios.\nMost of these factors are outside of the Company’s control. Among other factors, rating agencies consider the level of statutory capital and surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries as well as the level of GAAP capital held by the Company in determining the Company’s financial strength and credit ratings. Rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.\n100\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

These loans are collateralized by real estate properties that are diversified both geographically throughout the United States and by property type. These commercial loans are originated by the Company as high quality whole loans, and the Company may sell participation interests in one or more loans to third parties. A loan participation interest represents a pro-rata share in interest and principal payments generated by the participated loan, and the relationship between the Company as loan originator, lead participant and servicer and the third party as a participant are governed by a participation agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2024, mortgage loans had an amortized cost of $6.4 billion and carrying value of $6.4 billion, with an ACL of $44. As of December 31, 2023, mortgage loans had an amortized cost of $6.1 billion and carrying value of $6.1 billion, with an ACL of $51. The release in the allowance reflects write-\noffs, improved economic scenario forecasts and property specific reductions, partially offset by net additions of new loans.\nThe Company funded $601 million of commercial mortgage loans, primarily industrial properties, with a weighted average loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of 58% and a weighted average yield of 7.1% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. The Company continues to originate commercial mortgage loans on institutional-quality properties with strong LTV ratios. There were no mortgage loans held for sale as of December 31, 2024, or December 31, 2023.\nMunicipal Bonds\nThe following table presents the Company’s exposure to municipal bonds by type and weighted average credit quality included in the preceding Securities by Type table.\n103\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

The notes are typically secured by lease payments made by the municipality that is leasing the facilities financed by the issue. Lease payments may be subject to annual appropriation by the municipality or the municipality may be obligated to appropriate general tax revenues to make lease payments.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the largest issuer concentrations were the State of Illinois, the State of California, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds. As of December 31, 2023, the largest issuer concentrations were the New York City Transitional Finance Authority, the State of Illinois, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds. In total, municipal bonds make up 9% of the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio.\nLimited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments\nThe following table presents the Company’s investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments which include real estate joint ventures, real estate funds, private equity funds, other funds, and other alternative investments. Private equity funds primarily consist of investments in funds whose assets typically consist of a diversified pool of investments in small to mid-sized non-public businesses with high growth potential and strong owner sponsorship, as well as limited exposure to public markets.\nIncome or losses on investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments are recognized on a lag as results from private equity investments and other funds are generally reported on a three-month delay.\nLimited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments - Net Investment Income\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nAmount\nYield [1]\nAmount\nYield [1]\nAmount\nYield [1]\nReal estate joint ventures and funds\n$\n(67)\n(3.4)\n%\n$\n(10)\n(0.5)\n%\n$\n316 \n21.9 \n%\nPrivate equity funds\n108 \n5.9 \n%\n161 \n9.9 \n%\n186 \n14.2 \n%\nOther funds\n60 \n11.7 \n%\n29 \n6.6 \n%\n32 \n10.5 \n%\nOther alternative investments [2]\n47 \n9.1 \n%\n32 \n6.6 \n%\n(19)\n(3.8)\n%\nTotal\n$\n148\n \n3.0\n \n%\n$\n212\n \n4.8\n \n%\n$\n515\n \n14.4\n \n%\n[1]\nYields calculated using annualized net investment income divided by the monthly average invested assets.\n[2]\nConsists of an insurer-owned life insurance policy which is primarily invested in private equity funds and fixed income.\n104\n|\nTable of Contents\nIndex to MD&A\nPart II - Item 7.

As of December 31, 2024, $1.7 billion of the gross unrealized losses were associated with fixed maturities, AFS depressed less than 20% of amortized cost. The remaining $0.5 billion of gross unrealized losses were associated with fixed maturities, AFS depressed greater than 20%. The fixed maturities, AFS depressed more than 20% primarily related to corporate fixed maturities, U.S. Treasuries, and municipal bonds, that are mainly depressed because current interest rates are higher than at the respective purchase dates.\nAs part of the Company’s ongoing investment monitoring process, the Company has reviewed its fixed maturities, AFS in an unrealized loss position and concluded that these fixed maturities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the investments approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. For these fixed maturities in an unrealized loss position where an ACL has not been recorded, the Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the investment. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these investments.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCredit Losses on Fixed Maturities, AFS and Intent-to-Sell Impairments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\nThe Company recorded net credit losses of $2, primarily attributable to increases in the ACL of $1 on CMBS and $1 on a below investment grade corporate issuer. Unrealized losses on securities with an ACL recognized in OCI were less than $1. For further information, refer to Note 5 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThere were no intent-to-sell impairments\nThe Company incorporates its best estimate of future performance using internal assumptions and judgments that are informed by economic and industry specific trends, as well as our expectations with respect to security specific developments.\nFuture intent-to-sell impairments or credit losses may develop as the result of changes in our intent to sell specific securities that are in an unrealized loss position or if modeling assumptions, such as macroeconomic factors or security specific developments, change unfavorably from our current modeling assumptions, resulting in lower cash flow expectations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\nThe Company recorded net credit losses of $14, primarily attributable to increases in the ACL of $12 related to three below investment grade corporate issuers and $2 related to a CMBS that had an ACL in the prior period driven by prepayments.
