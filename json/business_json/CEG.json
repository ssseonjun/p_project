BUSINESS – Price and Supply Risk Management for additional information on how we mitigate market price risk. \nSee Note 6 — Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding nuclear PTC.\nDerivative Revenues.  \nWe record revenues and expenses using the fair value method of accounting, also referred to as mark-to-market method of accounting for transactions that are accounted for as derivatives. These derivative transactions primarily relate to commodity price risk management activities. Mark-to-market revenues and expenses include inception gains or losses on new transactions where the fair value is observable, unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of open contracts, and realized gains and losses.\nFinancial Results of Operations\nGAAP Results of Operations.  \nThe following table sets forth our consolidated GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. For additional information regarding the financial results for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, see the discussions of Results of Operations below.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n$ Change\n2024\n2023\nGAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$\n3,749 \n$\n1,623 \n$\n2,126 \nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings.  \nWe utilize Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings (and/or its per share equivalent) in our internal analysis, and in communications with investors and analysts, as a consistent measure for comparing our financial performance and discussing the factors and trends affecting our business. The presentation of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is intended to complement and should not be considered an alternative to, nor more useful than, the presentation of GAAP Net Income.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a standardized financial measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations of similarly titled measures.\nUnless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling adjustment between GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all adjustments except the NDT fund investment returns, which are included in decommissioning-related activities, the marginal statutory income tax rate was 25.5% and 25.1%\n \nfor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Under IRS regulations, NDT fund investment returns are taxed at different rates for investments if they are in qualified or non-qualified funds. The effective tax rates for the unrealized and realized gains and losses related to NDT funds were 54.8% and 52.4% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n. \nThe following table provides a reconciliation between GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nEarnings Per Share\n(a)\nEarnings Per Share\n(a)\nGAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$\n3,749 \n$\n11.89 \n$\n1,623 \n$\n5.01 \nUnrealized (Gain) Loss on Fair Value Adjustments (net of taxes $346 and $169, respectively)\n(b)\n(1,026)\n(3.25)\n506 \n1.56 \nPlant Retirements and Divestitures (net of taxes $9 and $2, respectively)\n28 \n0.09 \n(7)\n(0.02)\nDecommissioning-Related Activities (net of taxes $244 and $339, respectively)\n(c)\n(50)\n(0.16)\n(183)\n(0.56)\nPension & OPEB Non-Service (Credits) Costs (net of taxes $2 and $14, respectively)\n5 \n0.02 \n(41)\n(0.13)\nSeparation Costs (net of taxes $3 and $21, respectively)\n(d)\n9 \n0.03 \n62 \n0.19 \nERP System Implementation Costs (net of taxes $3 and $6, respectively)\n8 \n0.02 \n19 \n0.06 \nChange in Environmental Liabilities (net of taxes $22 and $11, respectively)\n65 \n0.21 \n33 \n0.10 \nIncome Tax-Related Adjustments\n(e)\n(52)\n(0.17)\n(9)\n(0.03)\nAcquisition-Related Costs (net of taxes $2 and $3, respectively)\n6 \n0.02 \n9 \n0.03 \nAsset Impairments (net of taxes $— and $9, respectively)\n— \n— \n62 \n0.19 \nNoncontrolling Interests\n(f)\n(7)\n(0.02)\n(40)\n(0.12)\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings\n$\n2,735 \n$\n8.67 \n$\n2,034 \n$\n6.28 \n__________\n(a)\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.

The nuclear fleet capacity factor presented in the table is defined as the ratio of the actual output of a unit (or combination of units) over a period of time to its output if the unit had operated at net monthly mean capacity for that time period. We consider capacity factor to be a useful measure to analyze the nuclear fleet performance between periods. We have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. However, these measures are not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or be more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.\n2024\n2023\nNuclear fleet capacity factor\n94.6 \n%\n94.4 \n%\nRefueling outage days\n230 \n256 \nNon-refueling outage days\n36 \n51 \nNuclear PTC.  \nBeginning in 2024, our existing nuclear units are eligible for a PTC extending through 2032. The nuclear PTC provides a transferable credit up to $15 per MWh (a base credit of $3 per MWh with a five times multiplier provided certain prevailing wage requirements are met) and is subject to phase-out when annual gross receipts are between $25.00 per MWh and $43.75 per MWh. We have evaluated and expect to meet the annual prevailing wage requirements at all our nuclear units and are eligible for the five times multiplier. Both the amount of the PTC and the gross receipts thresholds adjust for inflation after 2024 through the duration of the program based on the GDP price deflator for the preceding calendar year. The benefits of the PTC may be realized through a credit against our federal income taxes or transferred via sale to an unrelated party.\nMany of the state-sponsored programs (i.e., ZECs and CMCs) providing compensation for the emissions-free attributes of generation from certain of our nuclear units include contractual or other provisions that require us to refund that compensation up to the amount of the nuclear PTC received or pass through the entirety of the nuclear PTC received. See Note 6 — Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the nuclear PTC.\nZEC Prices.  \nWe are compensated through state programs for the carbon-free attributes of our nuclear generation. The following table includes the average ZEC reference prices ($/MWh) for each of our major regions in which state programs have been enacted. Gross prices reflect the weighted average price for the various delivery periods within the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and may not necessarily reflect prices we ultimately realize as a result of interaction with the nuclear PTC discussed above.\n2024 vs. 2023\nState (Region)\n(a)\n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n% Change\nNew Jersey (Mid-Atlantic)\n(b)\n$\n9.98 \n$\n9.92 \n$\n0.06 \n0.6 \n%\nIllinois (Midwest)\n(c)\n5.60 \n5.18 \n0.42 \n8.1 \n%\nNew York (New York)\n18.27 \n19.05 \n(0.78)\n(4.1)\n%\n__________\n(a)\nSee ITEM 1.

Following the latest annual update in August 2024, the ZEC price for the delivery period beginning June 2023 through May 2024 was calculated to be $9.95.\n(c)\nSee Note 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Illinois ZEC program.\nIllinois CMC Price.  \nThe price received (paid) for each CMC is determined by the IPA monthly and is based on the accepted CMC bid, less the sum of (a) monthly weighted average PJM Busbar price, (b) ComEd zone capacity price and (c) any federal tax credit or subsidy received by each qualifying plant and is subject to a customer protection cap ($30.30 per MWh for initial delivery period June 2022 through May 2023, $32.50 per MWh for the period June 2023 through May 2024 and $33.43 per MWh for the period June 2024 through May 2025). If the monthly CMC price per MWh calculation results in a net positive value, ComEd will multiply that value by the delivered quantity and pay the total to us. If the CMC price per MWh calculation results in a net negative value, we will multiply this value by the delivered quantity and pay the net value to ComEd. The average \n63\nTable of Contents\nCMC prices per MWh were $8.05 and $4.13 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The average CMC prices may not necessarily reflect prices we ultimately realize as a result of interaction with the nuclear PTC discussed above.\nCapacity Prices.  \nWe participate in capacity auctions in each of our major regions, except ERCOT which does not have a capacity market. We also incur capacity costs associated with load served, which are factored into customer sales prices. Capacity prices have a material impact on our \noperating revenues\n and purchased power and fuel expense. We report capacity on a net monthly basis within each region in either Operating revenues or Purchased power and fuel expense, depending on our net monthly position. The following table presents the average capacity prices ($/MW Day) for each of our major regions. Prices reflect the weighted average prices for the various auction periods within the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n2024 vs. 2023\nLocation (Region)\n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n% Change\nEastern Mid-Atlantic Area Council (Mid-Atlantic)\n$\n51.89 \n$\n69.64 \n$\n(17.75)\n(25.5)\n%\nComEd (Midwest)\n31.09 \n48.64 \n(17.55)\n(36.1)\n%\nRest of State (New York)\n106.44 \n137.88 \n(31.44)\n(22.8)\n%\nSoutheast New England (Other)\n581.69 \n91.67 \n490.02 \n534.5 \n%\nElectricity Prices.  \nAs a producer and supplier of electricity, the price of electricity has a significant impact on our operating revenues and purchased power cost. We report the sale and purchase of electricity in the spot market on a net hourly basis in either Operating revenues or Purchased power and fuel expense within each region, depending on our net hourly position. The price of electricity is impacted by several variables, including but not limited to, the price of fuels, generation resources in the region, weather, ongoing competition, emerging technologies, as well as macroeconomic and regulatory factors.

The change in effective tax rate in 2024 compared 2023 is primarily attributable to the inclusion of nuclear PTCs which are non-taxable. See Note 13 — Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor discussion of the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources of MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS in the 2023 Form 10-K which was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024.\nAll results included throughout the liquidity and capital resources section are presented on a GAAP basis.\nOur operating and capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations, the sale of certain receivables, as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. Our business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. We annually evaluate our financing plan and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining our investment grade ratings while meeting our cash needs to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and OPEB obligations, and invest in new and existing ventures. A broad spectrum of financing alternatives beyond the core financing options can be used to meet our needs and fund growth, including monetizing assets in the portfolio via project financing, asset sales, and the use of other financing structures (e.g., joint ventures, minority partners, etc.). Our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions. If these conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, we have access to credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $9 billion. We utilize our credit facilities to support our commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings and to issue letters of credit. See the “Credit Matters and Cash Requirements” section below for additional information. We expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs, and capital expenditure requirements. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities include the sale of energy, energy-related products, and sustainable solutions, as well as sales of nuclear PTCs. Our future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by future demand for, and market prices of, energy and our ability to continue to produce and supply power at competitive costs, as well as to obtain collections from customers. \nThe following table provides a summary of the change in cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Years Ended December 31, \nCash flows from operating activities\n2024\n2023\n$ Change\nNet income (loss)\n$\n3,738 \n$\n1,577 \n$\n2,161 \nAdjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to cash:\nCollateral received (posted), net\n1,803 \n(1,491)\n3,294 \nOption premiums received (paid), net\n216 \n26 \n190 \nPension and non-pension postretirement benefit contributions\n(184)\n(54)\n(130)\nChanges in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities\n(a)\n(9,168)\n(8,355)\n(813)\nTotal non-cash operating activities\n(b)\n1,131 \n2,996 \n(1,865)\nNet cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\n$\n(2,464)\n$\n(5,301)\n$\n2,837 \n68\nTable of Contents\n__________\n(a)\nIncludes changes in Accounts receivable, Inventories, Accounts payable and accrued expenses, Income taxes, and Other assets and liabilities.\n(b)\nSee the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for details of non-cash operating activities, includes Depreciation, amortization, and accretion, Asset impairments, Gain on sale of assets and businesses, Deferred income taxes and amortization of ITCs, Net fair value changes related to derivatives, and Net realized and unrealized activity associated with NDTs and equity investments. See Note 22 — Supplemental Financial Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Other non-cash operating activities line.\nChanges in our cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in results of operations, as adjusted by changes in working capital in the normal course of business, except as discussed below. Significant operating cash flow impacts for 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n•\nIn 2024, $1,570 million of cash was received related to the sale of nuclear PTCs. See Note 6 — Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nDepending upon whether we are in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, \ncollateral \nmay be required to be posted with or collected from our counterparties, respectively. In addition, the collateral posting and collection requirements differ depending on whether the transactions are on an exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on collateral.\n•\nOption premiums received (paid), net\n relate to options contracts that we purchase and sell as part of our established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices. Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivative contracts.\n•\nIncrease in cash outflows for \npension and non-pension postretirement benefit contributions\n is primarily due to our annual qualified pension contribution of $161 million and $21 million made in February 2024 and July 2023, respectively. See Note 14 — Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and non-pension postretirement benefit plans.\n•\nA net increase in cash outflows for \nchanges in working capital and other noncurrent assets and liabilities\n primarily driven by an increase in cash collections applied to the Deferred Purchase Price (DPP) partially offset by an increase in liabilities associated with state-sponsored programs requiring refund or pass through of the nuclear PTC, as well as price changes related to natural gas purchases in 2024. See Note 7 — Accounts Receivable of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the sales of customer accounts receivable.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe following table provides a summary of the change in cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nCash flows from investing activities\n2024\n2023\n$ Change\nCollection of DPP, net\n$\n10,217 \n$\n7,340 \n$\n2,877 \nAcquisitions of assets and businesses\n(32)\n(1,690)\n1,658 \nInvestment in NDT funds, net\n(277)\n(228)\n(49)\nCapital expenditures\n(2,565)\n(2,422)\n(143)\nOther investing activities\n85 \n31 \n54 \nNet cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities\n$\n7,428 \n$\n3,031 \n$\n4,397 \n69\nTable of Contents\nSignificant investing cash flow impacts for 2024 and 2023 were as follows: \n•\nCollection of DPP, net\n increased primarily due to the increased cash collections applied to DPP as a result of a decrease in the drawn Facility balance in 2024 compared to 2023. In addition, more cash collections were reinvested in the Facility in 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, we have access to facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $9 billion. We had access to the commercial paper markets and had availability under our revolving credit facilities during 2024 to fund our short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. We routinely review the sufficiency of our liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. We closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising, and merger activity. See PART I,",
    "item1a": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.\nWe believe our cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets and our credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity to support the estimated future cash requirements discussed below, including the cash consideration necessary to close on our proposed acquisition of Calpine. See Note 2 — Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSecurity Ratings\nOur access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and our financing costs in those markets, may depend on our securities ratings. A loss of investment grade credit rating would have required a three-notch downgrade by S&P or Moody's from their current levels as of December 31, 2024 of BBB+ and Baa1, to BB+ and Ba1 or below, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had $6.7 billion of available capacity under our credit facilities and $3 billion of cash on hand. In the event of a credit downgrade below investment grade and a resulting requirement to provide incremental collateral exceeding available capacity under our credit facilities and cash on hand, we would be required to access additional liquidity through the capital markets. Our borrowings are not subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrade of our securities, although such a downgrade could increase fees and interest charges under our credit agreements. Our credit ratings were affirmed following the announcement of our proposed acquisition of Calpine.\nIf we had lost our investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2024, we would have been required to provide incremental collateral estimated to be approximately $1.9 billion to meet collateral obligations for derivatives, non-derivatives, NPNS, and applicable payables and receivables, net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements. \n72\nTable of Contents\nSee Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur most recent estimate of capital expenditures is approximately $3 billion and $3.5 billion for 2025 and 2026, respectively. Approximately 35% of projected capital expenditures are for the acquisition of nuclear fuel, which includes additional nuclear fuel to increase inventory levels in response to the potential for the continuing Russia and Ukraine conflict to impact our long-term nuclear fuel supply. Additionally, the above estimates of capital expenditures includes $1.7 billion of growth capital expenditures, including our planned restart of Crane, nuclear uprates, behind-the-meter infrastructure, and license renewals. The remaining amounts primarily reflect additions and upgrades to existing generation facilities (including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling outages). See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Other Key Business Drivers for more information on the Russia and Ukraine conflict.\nPlanned additions and upgrades and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions impacting our generating assets and other factors, including, but not limited to, market power prices, results of capacity auctions, potential legislative and regulatory actions, impacts of inflation, changes in the cost of materials and labor, and financing costs.\nWe anticipate funding these capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe consider various factors when making qualified pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act, and management of the pension obligation. The Pension Protection Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively) and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). The contributions in the table below reflect a funding strategy to make levelized annual contributions to offset the growth of the liability. Unlike the qualified pension plans, our non-qualified pension plans are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements.\nOPEB plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, though we have funded a portion of our plans. Annually, we evaluate whether additional funding for those plans is needed.\nExpected contributions in 2025 or future years could be affected by adjustments in our pension and OPEB funding strategy, market conditions, or pension regulation changes. See Note 14 — Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and OPEB contributions.\n73\nTable of Contents\nCash Requirements for Other Financial Commitments\n \nThe following table summarizes our projected cash payments as of December 31, 2024 under existing financial commitments with fixed or minimum payments required: \n2025\nBeyond 2025\nTotal\nTime Period\nLong-term debt\n$\n1,028 \n$\n7,446 \n$\n8,474 \n2025 - 2054\nInterest payments on long-term debt\n(a)\n438 \n5,805 \n6,243 \n2025 - 2054\nOperating leases\n(b)\n58 \n409 \n467 \n2025 - 2056\nPurchase power obligations\n(c)\n891 \n1,056 \n1,947 \n2025 - 2036\nFuel purchase agreements\n(d)\n1,381 \n8,630 \n10,011 \n2025 - 2040\nOther purchase obligations\n(e)\n1,400 \n1,992 \n3,392 \n2025 - 2057\nSNF obligation\n— \n1,366 \n1,366 \n2025 - 2040\nPension contributions\n(f)\n163 \n701 \n864 \n2025 - 2030\nTotal cash requirements\n$\n5,359 \n$\n27,405 \n$\n32,764 \n__________\n(a)\nInterest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding at December 31, 2024 and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early redemptions, or debt issuances.

The facility was amended effective December 31, 2024 resulting in an increased funding limit secured by certain receivables. See Note 7 — Accounts Receivable and Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements\n \nof the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProject Financing\nProject financing is based upon a nonrecourse financial structure, in which project debt is paid back from the cash generated by a specific asset or portfolio of assets. Borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project. Lenders do not have recourse against us in the event of a default. If \n74\nTable of Contents\na project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific debt covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other project-related borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. In these instances, if such repayment were not satisfied, or restructured, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. The potential requirement to repay the debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on project finance credit facilities and nonrecourse debt.\nCredit Facilities\nWe meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. We may use our credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our credit facilities.\nCapital Structure\n \nAt December 31, 2024, our capital structure consisted of the following:\nPercentage of Capital Structure\nLong-term debt\n38 \n%\nMember’s equity\n62 \n%\nNRC Minimum Funding Requirements\nNRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient funds will be available in certain minimum amounts for radiological decommissioning of the facility. These NRC minimum funding levels are typically based upon the assumption that decommissioning activities will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit. If a unit fails the NRC minimum funding test, then the plant’s owners or parent companies would be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through surety bonds, letters of credit, or parent company guarantees or making additional cash contributions to the NDT fund to ensure sufficient funds are available. See Note 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIf a nuclear plant were to retire before the end of its licensed life, there is a risk that it will no longer meet the NRC minimum funding requirements due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activities and a shorter time period over which the NDT funds could appreciate in value. A shortfall could require that we address the shortfall by providing additional financial assurances, such as surety bonds, letters of credit, or parent company guarantees for our share of the funding assurance. However, the amount of any assurance will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach, the associated level of costs, and the NDT fund investment performance going forward. No later than two years after shutting down a plant, we must submit a Post-shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report (PSDAR) to the NRC that includes the planned option for decommissioning the site. \nUpon issuance of any additional financial assurance mechanisms to address a decommissioning funding shortfall, subject to satisfying various regulatory preconditions, each site would be able to utilize the respective NDT funds for radiological decommissioning costs, which represent the majority of the total expected decommissioning costs. However, under the regulations, the NRC must approve an exemption in order for us to utilize the NDT funds to pay for non-radiological decommissioning costs (i.e., spent fuel management and site restoration costs, if applicable). Any amounts not covered by an exemption would be borne by us without reimbursement. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Crane NDT is fully funded under the SAFSTOR scenario that was the planned decommissioning option, as described in the Crane PSDAR filed with the NRC in April 2019. We will continue to file Crane's decommissioning funding status with the NRC annually until restart, at which point we will file decommissioning funding status reports in accordance with applicable NRC requirements. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, we have adequate NDT funds for the remaining radiological decommissioning cost at Zion \n75\nTable of Contents\nStation related to the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation. Decommissioning costs other than radiological may require funding from us. See Note 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit, interest rates, and equity prices. We manage these risks through risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The Executive Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors have oversight responsibilities for risk management. \nCommodity Price Risk\nCommodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental, regulatory, and environmental policies, and other factors. To the extent the total amount of energy we produce or procure differs from the amount of energy we have contracted to sell, we are exposed to market fluctuations in commodity prices. We seek to mitigate our commodity price risk through the sale and purchase of electricity, natural gas and oil, and other commodities.\nElectricity available from our owned or contracted generation supply in excess of our obligations to customers is sold into the wholesale markets. To reduce commodity price risk caused by market fluctuations, we enter non-derivative contracts as well as derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards, and options, with approved counterparties to hedge anticipated exposures. We use derivative instruments as economic hedges to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. We expect the settlement of the majority of our economic hedges will occur during 2025 through 2027.\nIn general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on owned and contracted generation positions that have not been hedged. Beginning in 2024, our existing nuclear fleet is eligible for the nuclear PTC provided by the IRA, an important tool in managing commodity price risk for each nuclear unit not already receiving state support. The nuclear PTC provides increasing levels of support as unit revenues decline below levels established in the IRA and is further adjusted for inflation after 2024 through the duration of the program based on the GDP price deflator for the preceding calendar year. See Note 6 — Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the nuclear PTC. \nIn locations and periods where our load serving activities do not naturally offset existing generation portfolio risk, remaining commodity price exposure is managed through portfolio hedging activities. Portfolio hedging activities are generally concentrated in the prompt three years, when customer demand and market liquidity enable effective price risk mitigation.  During this prompt three-year period, we seek to mitigate price risk associated with our load serving contracts, non-nuclear generation, and any residual price risk for our nuclear generation that the nuclear PTC and state programs may not fully mitigate. We also enter transactions that further optimize the economic benefits of our overall portfolio.\nThe forecasted market price risk exposure is the risk of a change in the value of unhedged positions. The forecasted market price risk exposure for our entire economic hedge portfolio associated with a $5/MWh reduction in the annual average around-the-clock energy price based on December 31, 2024 market conditions and hedged position results in an immaterial impact to earnings for 2025 and 2026, respectively, largely due to the nuclear PTC. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFuel Procurement\nWe procure natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts, and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term contracts for uranium concentrates, conversion services, enrichment services, (or a combination thereof) and fabrication services, including contracts sourced from Russia. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make our procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. We engage a diverse set of suppliers to secure the nuclear fuel needed to continue to operate \n76\nTable of Contents\nour nuclear fleet long-term.  Approximately 45% of our uranium concentrate requirements from 2025 through 2029 are supplied by three suppliers. To-date, we have not experienced any counterparty credit risk associated with these suppliers stemming from the Russia and Ukraine conflict. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, we believe that replacement uranium concentrate can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Geopolitical developments, including the Russia and Ukraine conflict and United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Canadian sanctions against Russia, have the potential to impact delivery from multiple suppliers in the international uranium processing industry. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Other Key Business Drivers for more information on the Russia and Ukraine conflict. \nTrading and Non-Trading Marketing Activities\nThe following table provides detail on changes in our commodity mark-to-market net assets (liabilities) balance sheet position from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024.

The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of credit risk.\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\nAs part of the normal course of business, we routinely enter physically or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of capacity, electricity, fuels, emissions allowances, and other energy-related products. In accordance with the contracts and applicable law, if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on our net position with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral.\nWe sell output through bilateral contracts. The bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations. Any failure to collect these payments from counterparties could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As market prices rise above or fall below contracted price levels, we are required to post collateral with purchasers; as market prices fall below contracted price levels, counterparties are required to post collateral with us. To post collateral, we depend on access to bank credit facilities, which serve as liquidity sources to fund collateral requirements. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Liquidity and Capital Resources —\n Credit Matters and Cash Requirements — Credit Facilities for additional information.\nRTOs and ISOs\nWe participate in all of the established wholesale energy markets that are administered by PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO, CAISO, MISO, SPP, AESO, and ERCOT. ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar function in Texas to that performed by RTOs and ISOs in markets regulated by FERC. In these areas, power and related products are traded through bilateral agreements between buyers and sellers and in the energy markets \n78\nTable of Contents\nthat are administered by the RTOs or ISOs, as applicable. In areas where there is no RTO or ISO to administer energy markets, electricity and related products are purchased and sold solely through bilateral agreements. For activities administered by an RTO or ISO, the RTO or ISO maintains financial assurance policies that are established and enforced by those administrators. The credit policies of the RTOs and ISOs may, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member be shared by the remaining participants. Non-performance or non-payment by a major member of an RTO or ISO could result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. \nExchange Traded Transactions\nWe enter commodity transactions on NYMEX, ICE, NASDAQ, NGX, and the Nodal exchange (each an Exchange and, collectively, Exchanges). The Exchange clearinghouses act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the Exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, transactions on Exchanges are significantly collateralized and have limited counterparty credit risk.\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk\nWe use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. We may also utilize interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposure. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in the interest rates associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and fixed-to-floating swaps would not have resulted in a material decrease in our\n earnings\n for the year ended December 31, 2024. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we utilize foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nEquity Price Risk\nWe maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund the costs of decommissioning our nuclear plants. Our NDT funds are reflected at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate us for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs; however, the equity securities in the trust funds are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets, and the value of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. We actively monitor the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically review asset allocations in accordance with our NDT fund investment policy.\nA hypothetical 25 basis points increase in interest rates and 10% decrease in equity prices would have resulted in a $943 million reduction in the fair value of our NDT trust assets as of December 31, 2024. This calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates and equity prices. See Liquidity and Capital Resources section of ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, and Note 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOur employee benefit plan trusts also hold investments in equity and debt securities.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCEG Parent’s management assessed the effectiveness of CEG Parent’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, CEG Parent’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, CEG Parent’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of CEG Parent’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\nFebruary 18, 2025\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Constellation) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nConstellation’s management assessed the effectiveness of Constellation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, Constellation’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, Constellation’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nFebruary 18, 2025\n80\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Constellation Energy Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, as listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1)(i), and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1)(ii), of Constellation Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding \n81\nTable of Contents\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nNuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) Assessment\nAs described in Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power plants following the permanent cessation of operations. To estimate its decommissioning obligations management uses a probability- weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models, and discount rates. Management updates its ARO annually, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios.  As of December 31, 2024, the nuclear decommissioning ARO was $12.2 billion.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company’s nuclear decommissioning ARO assessment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when estimating its decommissioning obligations; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s discounted cash flow model and significant assumptions related to decommissioning cost studies; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s development of the inputs, assumptions, and discounted cash flow model used in management’s ARO assessment. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for estimating the decommissioning obligations by evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to decommissioning cost studies. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the results of decommissioning cost studies.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBaltimore, Maryland\nFebruary 18, 2025\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2022.\n82\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Board of Directors and Member of Constellation Energy Generation, LLC\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, as listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)(i), and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)(ii), of Constellation Energy Generation, LLC and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

Our generating capacity includes primarily nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric assets. Through our integrated business operations, we sell electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related products and sustainable solutions to various types of customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, public sector, and residential customers in markets across multiple geographic regions. We have \nfive\n reportable segments: Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT and Other Power Regions.\nBasis of Presentation \nConstellation Energy Corporation (“CEG Parent” or the “Company”), a Pennsylvania corporation, was formed for the purpose of separation of Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (“Constellation”, formerly Exelon Generation Company, LLC) and its subsidiaries from its predecessor parent company, Exelon Corporation (“Exelon”), into an independent, publicly traded company. On February 1, 2022, the separation was completed by distributing all the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, on a pro rata basis to the holders of its predecessor’s common stock, with the Company holding all the interests in Constellation previously held by Exelon (the \"Separation\"). Constellation has been an individual registrant since 2002 with the registration of its public debt securities under the Securities Act. Prior to the Separation, Constellation historically filed consolidated financial statements as an individual registrant to reflect its financial position and operating results as a stand-alone, wholly owned subsidiary of Exelon. \nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for annual financial statements and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of our subsidiaries and all intercompany transactions have been eliminat\ned. CEG Parent's prior period financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the balances of Constellation in accordance with applicable guidance.  Amounts disclosed relate to CEG Parent and Constellation unless specifically noted as relating to CEG Parent only. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references herein to the terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer collectively to CEG Parent and Constellation.\nWe own 100% of our significant consolidated subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, except for certain consolidated VIEs. The remaining interests in the consolidated VIEs are included in noncontrolling interests on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 21 — Variable Interest Entities for additional information on consolidated VIEs.\nWe consolidate the accounts of entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, after the elimination of intercompany transactions. Where we do not have a controlling financial interest in an entity, proportionate consolidation, equity method accounting or accounting for investments in equity securities with or without readily determinable fair value is applied. We proportionately consolidate our undivided ownership interest in jointly-owned electric plants. Under proportionate consolidation, we separately record our proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the undivided interest in the asset. See Note 9 — Jointly-Owned Electric Plants for additional information on application of proportionate consolidation. \nWe apply equity method accounting when we have a significant influence over an investee through an ownership in equity, which generally approximates to a 20% to 50% voting interest. We apply equity method accounting to certain investments and joint ventures. Under equity method accounting, we report our interest in the entity as an investment and our percentage share of the earnings from the entity as single line items in our consolidated financial statements. We use accounting for investments in equity securities with or without readily determinable fair values if we lack a significant influence, which generally results when we hold less than 20% of the common stock of an entity. Under accounting for investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, the investments are reported based on quoted prices in active markets and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings. Under accounting for investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, the investments are reported at cost, adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment, and changes in measurement are reported in earnings.\n95\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Basis of Presentation\nSeparation from Exelon\nPrior to completion of the separation, our financial statements include certain transactions with affiliates of Exelon, which are disclosed as related party transactions. After February 1, 2022, all transactions with Exelon or its affiliates are no longer related party transactions.\nIn order to govern the ongoing relationships with Exelon after the separation, and to facilitate an orderly transition, we entered into several agreements with Exelon, including the following:\n•\nSeparation Agreement – sets forth the principal actions to be taken in connection with the separation, including the transfer of assets and assumption of liabilities and establishes certain rights and obligations between us following the distribution \n•    TSA – governs all matters relating to the provision of services between us and Exelon on a transitional basis, in addition to providing us with certain services. The services include support for information technology, accounting, finance, human resources, security, and various other administrative and operational services (the TSA ended in June 2024)\n•    Employee Matters Agreement (EMA) – addresses certain employment, compensation and benefits matters, including the allocation of employees between us and Exelon and the allocation and treatment of certain assets and liabilities relating to our employees and former employees\n•    TMA – governs the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations between us and Exelon with respect to all tax matters (excluding employee-related taxes covered under the EMA)\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement, we received a cash contribution of $\n1.75\n billion from Exelon on January 31, 2022, the proceeds of which were used to settle $\n258\n million of an intercompany loan from Exelon and $\n200\n million of short-term debt outstanding prior to separation, in addition to a $\n192\n million contribution to our pension plans. \nThe amounts Exelon billed us for services pursuant to the TSA were not material in 2024 and $\n151\n million and $\n266\n million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The amounts we billed Exelon for services pursuant to the TSA were not material to the periods presented.\nUse of Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas in which significant estimates have been made include, but are not limited to, the accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs and other AROs, pension and OPEB plans, inventory reserves, allowance for credit losses, long-lived asset valuations and impairment assessments, derivative instruments, goodwill, unamortized energy contracts, fixed asset depreciation, environmental costs and other loss contingencies, taxes and unbilled energy revenues. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \nRevenues \nOperating Revenues.  \nOur operating revenues generally consist of revenues from contracts with customers involving competitive sales of power, natural gas, and other energy-related products and sustainable solutions. We recognize revenue from contracts with customers to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. At the end of each reporting period, we accrue an estimate for the unbilled amount of power and natural gas delivered or services provided to customers.\nCommodity Derivatives.  \nDerivative instruments are generally recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as realized and unrealized revenue or expense. The classification of revenue or expense is based on the intent of the transaction.\n See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.\nTaxes Directly Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions.  \nWe collect certain taxes from customers such as sales and gross receipts taxes, along with other taxes, surcharges and fees, that are levied by state or local \n96\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Basis of Presentation\ngovernments on the sale or distribution of electricity and natural gas and any taxable energy-related products and services. Some of these taxes are imposed on the customer, but paid by us, while others are imposed on us. Where these taxes are imposed on the customer, such as sales taxes, they are reported on a net basis in revenues. However, where these taxes are imposed on us, such as gross receipts taxes, they are reported on a gross basis in revenue and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n \nGovernment Assistance.  \nAs a result of the enactment of the IRA, we qualify for certain federal government incentives through eligible activities. These incentives include both refundable and transferable tax credits. The current U.S. GAAP framework does not address the receipt of government assistance by for-profit entities. We account for this government assistance by analogy to International Accounting Standard (IAS) 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, and recognize the benefits when there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with the required conditions and that the benefits will be received. We believe the reasonable assurance term as used in IAS 20 is analogous to the term probable as defined under GAAP related to accounting for contingencies.\n See Note 6 — Government Assistance for additional information.\nLeases \nWe recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for operating leases with a term of greater than one year. Operating lease ROU assets are included in Other deferred debits and other assets and operating lease liabilities are included in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ROU asset is measured as the sum of (1) the present value of all remaining fixed and in-substance fixed payments using the rate implicit in the lease whenever that is readily determinable or our incremental borrowing rate, (2) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date (less any lease incentives received) and (3) any initial direct costs incurred. The lease liability is measured the same as the ROU asset, but excludes any payments made before the commencement date and initial direct costs incurred. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. We include non-lease components for most asset classes, which are service-related costs that are not integral to the use of the asset, in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability.\nExpense for operating leases and leases with a term of one year or less is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the derivation of benefit from use of the leased property. Variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is incurred and consist primarily of payments for purchases of electricity under contracted generation that are based on the electricity produced by those generating assets. Operating lease expense and variable lease payments are recorded to Purchased power and fuel expense for contracted generation or Operating and maintenance expense for all other lease agreements in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nIncome from operating leases, including subleases, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the pattern in which income is earned over the term of the lease. Variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is performed and consist primarily of payments received from sales of electricity under contracted generation that are based on the electricity produced by those generating assets. Operating lease income and variable lease payments are recorded to Operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nOur operating leases consist primarily of contracted generation, real estate including office buildings, and vehicles and equipment. We generally account for contracted generation in which the generating asset is not renewable as a lease if the customer has dispatch rights and obtains substantially all the economic benefits.  We generally do not account for contracted generation in which the generating asset is renewable as a lease if the customer does not design the generating asset. We account for land right arrangements that provide for exclusive use as leases while shared use land arrangements are generally not leases.\nSee Note 11 — Leases for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred federal and state income taxes are recorded on temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax benefits carried forward. ITCs have been deferred in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in book income over the life of the related property. We account for uncertain \n97\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Basis of Presentation\nincome tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Interest expense, net or Other, net (interest income) and recognize penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nCash and Cash Equivalents \nWe consider investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents represent funds that are restricted to satisfy designated current liabilities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented the payment of medical, dental, vision, and long-term disability benefits and project-specific nonrecourse financing structures for debt service and financing of operations of the underlying entities.\n See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements and Note 22 — Supplemental Financial Information for additional information.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Accounts Receivables \nThe allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of losses on the customers' accounts receivable balances based on historical experience, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. \nThe allowance for credit losses for our retail and wholesale customers is based on accounts receivable aging historical experience coupled with specific identification through a credit monitoring process, which considers current conditions and forward-looking information such as industry trends, macroeconomic factors, changes in the regulatory environment, external credit ratings, publicly available news, payment status, payment history, and the exercise of collateral calls. When a wholesale customer’s risk characteristics are no longer aligned with the pooled population, we use specific identification to develop an allowance for credit losses. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. \nWe have certain non-customer receivables in Current Assets and Other deferred debits and other assets which primarily are with governmental agencies. The allowance for credit losses related to these receivables is not material. We monitor these balances and will record an allowance if there are indicators of a decline in credit quality.\n \nVariable Interest Entities\nWe account for our investments in and arrangements with VIEs based on the following specific requirements:\n•\nqualitative assessment of factors determinant in whether we have a controlling financial interest,\n•\nongoing reconsideration of this assessment, and\n•\nwhere we consolidate a VIE (as primary beneficiary), disclosure of (1) the assets of the consolidated VIE, if they can be used to only settle specific obligations of the consolidated VIE, and (2) the liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.\nSee Note 21 — Variable Interest Entities for additional information.\nInventories\nInventory is recorded at the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value. Provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory. Natural gas, oil, and emission allowances are generally included in Inventory when purchased and are expensed to Purchased power and fuel expense when consumed. Materials and supplies are generally included in Inventory when purchased and are expensed to Operating and maintenance, or capitalized to Property, plant and equipment, as appropriate, when installed or used.\n98\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Basis of Presentation\nDebt and Equity Security Investments \nDebt and Equity Investments within NDT funds.  \nWe have debt and equity securities held in our NDT funds which are measured and recorded at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of trust level taxes, on our NDT funds associated with the Regulatory Agreement Units are offset in Noncurrent payables related to Regulatory Agreement Units. Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of trust level taxes, on our NDT funds associated with the Non-Regulatory Agreement Units are included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected to use the NAV for qualifying investments as a practical expedient to determine the fair values. Our NDT funds are classified as current or noncurrent assets, depending on the timing of the decommissioning activities and expected payment of income taxes on trust earnings.\n See Note 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations and Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for additional information.\nEquity Security Investments with Readily Determinable Fair Values.  \nWe have certain equity securities with readily determinable fair values. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n See Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for additional information.\nEquity Security Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Values.  \nWe have certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values. We have elected to use the measurement alternative to measure these investments, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment. Changes in measurement, are reported in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n See Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at acquired cost. Acquired cost includes construction-related direct labor and material costs. When appropriate, acquired cost also includes capitalized interest. Costs associated with nuclear outages and planned major maintenance activities, are expensed to Operating and maintenance expense or capitalized to Property, plant, and equipment based on the nature of the activities in the period incurred. The cost of repairs and maintenance and minor replacements of property is charged to Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as incurred.\nUpon retirement, the cost of property is generally charged to accumulated depreciation in accordance with the composite and group methods of depreciation. Upon replacement of an asset, the costs to remove the asset, net of salvage, are capitalized to gross plant when incurred as part of the cost of the newly installed asset and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset. Removal costs, net of salvage, incurred for property that will not be replaced is charged to Operating and maintenance expense as incurred. Certain assets follow the unitary method of depreciation and recognize gains and losses in the period of replacement or retirement. These gains and losses are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nCapitalized Software. \nCertain costs, such as design, coding, and testing incurred during the application development stage of software projects that are internally developed or purchased for operational use are capitalized in Property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Similar costs incurred for cloud-based solutions treated as service arrangements are capitalized in Other current assets and Deferred debits and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such capitalized amounts are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become operational, generally not to exceed \nfive years\n. \nCapitalized Interest. \nDuring construction, we capitalize the costs of debt funds. Most projects will use a debt rate calculated using the general corporate debt pool. In some cases, projects are specifically financed and use a project specific debt rate, which is excluded from the general corporate debt pool. Capitalization of debt funds is recorded as a charge to construction work in progress and as a non-cash credit to interest expense.\n See Note 8 — Property, Plant, and Equipment, Note 9 — Jointly-Owned Electric Plants and Note 22 — Supplemental Financial Information for additional information.\n99\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Basis of Presentation\nNuclear Fuel \nThe cost of nuclear fuel is capitalized in Property, plant and equipment and charged to Purchased power and fuel using the unit-of-production method. Any potential future SNF disposal fees will also be expensed through Purchased power and fuel expense. Additionally, certain on-site SNF storage costs are being reimbursed by the DOE since a DOE (or government-owned) long-term storage facility has not been completed.\n See Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies for additional information regarding the cost of SNF storage and disposal.\nDepreciation and Amortization \nExcept for the amortization of nuclear fuel, depreciation, inclusive of ARC, is generally recorded over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis using the group, composite or unitary methods of depreciation. Two methods of depreciating multiple asset groups exist: the group method and the composite method. The group method is typically for groups of assets that are largely homogenous and have approximately the same useful lives. The composite method is used when the assets are heterogeneous and have different lives. Under both methods, a reporting entity depreciates the assets over the average life of the assets in the group. The estimated useful lives are based on a combination of depreciation studies, historical retirements, site licenses and management estimates of operating costs and expected future energy market conditions.\n See Note 8 — Property, Plant, and Equipment for additional information regarding depreciation, and Note 22 — Supplemental Financial Information for additional information regarding amortization expense of nuclear fuel.\nAsset Retirement Obligations \nWe estimate and recognize a liability for our legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities even though the timing and/or methods of settlement may be conditional on future events. We generally update our nuclear decommissioning ARO annually, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on our annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to the multiple outcome scenarios within our probability-weighted discounted cash flow models. Our multiple outcome scenarios are generally based on decommissioning cost studies which are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of our nuclear units at least every five years, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates. AROs are accreted throughout each year to reflect the time value of money for these present value obligations through a charge to Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for Non-Regulatory Agreement Units and through an offsetting decrease in noncurrent payables related to Regulatory Agreement Units.\n See Note 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.\nAccounting Implications of the Regulatory Agreement Units\nBased on the requirements of the ICC, PAPUC, and PUCT that dictate our obligations related to the shortfall or excess of NDT funds necessary for decommissioning the former ComEd, former PECO, and STP units, decommissioning-related activities net of applicable taxes, including realized and unrealized gains and losses on the NDT funds, depreciation of the ARC, and accretion of the decommissioning obligation are generally offset in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and are recorded as noncurrent payables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (within Payables related to Regulatory Agreement Units).\n See Note 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.\nAsset Impairments \nLong-Lived Assets.  \nWe regularly monitor and evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including, but not limited to, declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. We determine if long-lived assets or asset groups are potentially impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value when indicators of impairment exist. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. Impairment losses are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.  \n100\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Basis of Presentation\nGoodwill.  \nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\n See Note 2 — Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions and Note 12 — Intangible Assets for additional information.\nEquity Method Investments.  \nWe regularly monitor and evaluate equity method investments to determine whether they are impaired. An impairment is recorded when the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary in nature. Additionally, if the entity in which we hold an investment recognizes an impairment loss, we would record the proportionate share of that impairment loss and evaluate the investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value. These impairment losses are recorded in Equity in income (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nEquity Security Investments.  \nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured and recorded at fair value with any changes in fair value recorded in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected to use the measurement alternative to measure these investments, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are qualitatively assessed for impairment each reporting period. If it is determined that the equity security is impaired, an impairment loss will be recognized in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the amount by which the security’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nDerivative Financial Instruments \nAll derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value unless they qualify for certain exceptions, including NPNS. For derivatives intended to serve as economic hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period. Amounts classified in earnings are included in Operating revenues, Purchased power and fuel, or Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income based on the activity the transaction is economically hedging. While most of the derivatives serve as economic hedges, there are also derivatives entered into for proprietary trading purposes, subject to our RMP, and changes in the fair value of those derivatives are recorded in Operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing, or financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the nature of each transaction. \nAs part of the energy marketing business, we enter contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of our customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the energy markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery of the underlying physical commodity. NPNS are contracts where physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period and will not be financially settled. Revenues and expenses on derivative contracts that qualify, and are designated, as NPNS are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments, they are not required to be recorded at fair value.\n See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.\nRetirement Benefits \nEffective upon separation, we sponsor defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as described in Note 14 — Retirement Benefits. The plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under these plans were measured upon separation as of February 1, 2022 and are remeasured annually as of year-end. The measurements involved various factors, assumptions, and accounting elections. The impact of assumption changes or experiences different from that assumed on pension and OPEB obligations is recognized over time, not immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. For defined benefit pension plans, gains or losses exceeding the greater of ten percent of the PBO or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. For OPEB plans, gains or losses exceeding the greater of ten percent of the APBO or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the average future remaining lifetime of the current inactive population. \n101\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 — Basis of Presentation\nWe separately report the pension and OPEB service cost and non-service cost (credit) components of net periodic benefit costs (credits) for all plans in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. \nEffective \nFebruary 1, 2022\n, the service cost component remains in Operating and maintenance expense and Property, plant, and equipment, net (where criteria for capitalization of direct labor has been met) while the non-service cost (credit) components are included in Other, net, in accordance with single employer plan accounting.\nRenewable Energy Credits \nRECs are included in Renewable energy credits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Purchased RECs are recorded at cost on the date they are purchased and internally generated RECs are recognized at a zero-cost basis when generated. The cost of RECs purchased on a stand-alone basis is based on the transaction price, while the cost of RECs acquired through PPAs represents the relative fair value at contract inception. Generally, revenue for RECs that are sold to a counterparty under a contract that specifically identifies a power plant are recognized at a point in time when the power is produced. This includes both bundled and unbundled REC sales. Otherwise, the revenue is recognized upon physical transfer of the REC to the customer.\n2.    \nMergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions \nProposed Acquisition of Calpine Corporation\nOn January 10, 2025, we entered an agreement and plan of merger (Merger Agreement) with Calpine Corporation (Calpine) under which we will acquire all the outstanding equity interests of Calpine in a cash and stock transaction. Calpine owns and operates a generation fleet of natural gas, geothermal, battery storage, and solar assets with over \n27\n GWs of generation capacity, in addition to a competitive retail electric supplier platform serving approximately \n60\n TWhs of load annually. This acquisition is complementary to and aligns strategically with our existing business operations and provides both increased scale and meaningful market diversification.\nThe merger consideration at closing will consist of an aggregate of \n50\n million newly issued shares of our common stock, \nno\n par value, and $\n4.5\n billion in cash. We will also assume approximately $\n12.7\n billion of Calpine’s outstanding debt. We expect to fund the cash portion of the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and cash flow generated by Calpine in the period between signing and closing of the transaction (that will be assumed at closing). Per the terms of the Merger Agreement, consummation of the transaction is to occur by December 31, 2025 (which date may be automatically extended to June 1, 2026, as further provided in the Merger Agreement). The Merger Agreement also provides for certain termination rights, and under certain specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Calpine a termination fee of $\n500\n million. Completion of the transaction is conditioned upon review of the transaction by the DOJ, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and approval by the FERC, NYPSC, and PUCT, in addition to other regulatory bodies, and is subject to other customary closing conditions.\nIn connection with certain of the regulatory approvals required for the transaction, the companies will propose to divest certain generating assets located in PJM, the only market where there is a material overlap of generation owned by both companies.\nThe transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting and we will record the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. To the extent that the consideration transferred is greater than the fair value of the net assets acquired, goodwill will be recorded. To the extent the fair value of the net assets acquired is greater than the consideration transferred, a bargain purchase gain will be recorded.\nThrough December 31, 2024, fees incurred as part of the acquisition were not material to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. \nAcquisition of Joint Ownership in South Texas Project \nIn November 2023, we completed the acquisition of NRG South Texas LP (renamed and converted as Constellation South Texas, LLC), which owns a \n44\n% undivided ownership interest in the jointly-owned STP, a \n2,645\n MW, dual-unit nuclear plant located in Bay City, Texas. The consideration transferred was $\n1.66\n billion. Other owners include City Public Service Board of San Antonio (CPS, \n40\n%) and the City of Austin, Texas (Austin \n102\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 2 — Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions\nEnergy, \n16\n%). This acquisition is complementary to and aligned strategically with our existing clean energy business operations.\nThe acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their respective fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of our proportionate share of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded to goodwill. The goodwill recognized is primarily driven by the opportunity for continued operations through 80 years and the value of STP’s carbon-free energy that is not fully reflected by the markets. The goodwill amount has been assigned entirely to the ERCOT operating segment. See Note 12 — Intangible Assets for additional information. The total amount of goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes over the tax amortization period. \nThe fair values of STP’s assets and liabilities were determined based on significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows and future power and fuel market prices.  \nThe following table summarizes the final acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the assets and liabilities assumed for the STP acquisition:\nCash paid for purchase price\n$\n1,657\n \nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nProperty, plant, and equipment\n1,254\n \nNuclear decommissioning trust funds\n869\n \nInventories, net\n47\n \nOther long-term assets\n40\n \nOther current assets\n11\n \nTotal assets\n2,221\n \nAsset retirement obligations\n429\n \nPayables related to Regulatory Agreement Units\n376\n \nDeferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits\n65\n \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n42\n \nPension and OPEB obligations\n25\n \nOther long-term liabilities\n5\n \nTotal liabilities\n942\n \nTotal net identifiable assets, at fair value\n1,279\n \nGoodwill\n$\n378\n \nThe operating revenues and results of operations for STP have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income from the date of acquisition and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2023. The pro forma effects of this acquisition are not significant to our reported results for any periods presented. Accordingly, no pro forma financial information has been presented herein. \nIn July 2023, NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) accepted service of a lawsuit filed by the City of San Antonio, Texas, acting by and through CPS, in the 130th District Court of Matagorda County, Texas against NRG and certain of its subsidiaries, claiming the existence of a right of first refusal that applies to the transaction contemplated between us and NRG.  In July 2023, we intervened in the lawsuit and Austin Energy also intervened in the lawsuit claiming a similar right of first refusal. Per the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, NRG made representations that no right of first refusal applied to the transaction contemplated between us.\nIn May 2024, we executed a settlement agreement with all parties (CPS/City of San Antonio, Austin, and NRG), resolving all litigation involving our purchase of the ownership interest in STP. The terms of the settlement include us selling a \n2\n% ownership interest in STP to CPS at the same price and terms that we paid NRG for our \n44\n% \n103\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 2 — Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions\ninterest, subject to regulatory approvals from the NRC and the Public Utility Commission of Texas. Pursuant to the settlement, CPS and Austin filed Notices of Dismissal with Prejudice with the Court, which ends the litigation, and likewise withdrew their pending objections to the sale with the NRC. As a result of the settlement, we have reflected assets and liabilities associated with a \n2\n% undivided ownership interest in STP as held for sale. The held for sale amounts are included in the Other current assets and Other current liabilities balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024. Closing is expected to occur within the first half of 2025. Upon closing of the sale, we and CPS will each own a \n42\n% interest in STP, and Austin’s interest will remain at \n16\n%. The terms of settlement are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n \n3.     \nRegulatory Matters \nThe following matters below discuss the status of our material regulatory and legislative proceedings.\nNew England Regulatory Matters\nMystic Units 8 and 9 Cost of Service Agreement.\n \nIn December 2018, FERC issued an order accepting a cost of service agreement for Mystic Units 8 and 9 for the period between June 1, 2022 to May 31, 2024. The agreement was intended to preserve the two gas-fired electric generating units for the two-year period while allowing the Mystic units to recover their costs of operating, including a substantial portion of the costs associated with the adjacent EMT. Upon the expiration of the agreement on May 31, 2024, the two generating units retired.\nThe Mystic COS requires an annual process whereby we identify and support our projected costs under the agreement and/or true-up previous projections to the actual costs incurred. Interested parties then have the opportunity to challenge our filings.  In September 2022, we made our second of the five annual filings at FERC. In December 2023, FERC issued an order setting for settlement/hearing certain components of the second annual filing, including the issue of Mystic’s recovery of historical rate base costs. In July 2024, the active parties to the proceeding reached a settlement in principle to resolve the second annual filing. The same parties then proceeded to reach a global settlement that would resolve all outstanding matters related to the Mystic COS, including the fourth and fifth annual filing proceedings. A global settlement was filed with FERC in November 2024, and FERC approved the settlement in January 2025. The global settlement does not have a material financial impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFederal Regulatory Matters\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n \nIn August 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which, among other things, includes federal tax credits, certain of which are transferable or fully refundable, for a number of clean energy technologies including existing nuclear plants (45U). In addition, the IRA provides for a federal tax credit for technology-neutral clean energy production (45Y PTC or 48E ITC). We believe the planned restart of Crane and our planned nuclear uprates will be eligible for these credits. The nuclear PTC recognizes the contributions of carbon-free nuclear power by providing a federal tax credit of up to $15/MWh, subject to phase-out, beginning in 2024 and continuing through 2032. The nuclear PTC includes adjustments for inflation. The PTC benefiting existing nuclear plants included in the IRA continues to be the subject of additional guidance issued from the U.S. Treasury and IRS. \nOperating License Renewals\nConowingo Hydroelectric Project.\n \nIn\n \n2012, we submitted an application to FERC for a new license for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo). In connection with our efforts to obtain a water quality certification pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (401 Certification) from MDE for Conowingo, we had been working with MDE and other stakeholders to resolve water quality licensing issues, including: (1) water quality, (2) fish habitat, and (3) sediment.\nIn 2019, we and MDE filed with FERC a Joint Offer of Settlement (Offer of Settlement) that would resolve all outstanding issues relating to the 401 Certification. FERC subsequently issued a new 50-year license for Conowingo, effective March 1, 2021. Several environmental groups appealed FERC’s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The court of appeals issued a decision vacating FERC’s decision to grant Conowingo its license renewal and sending the matter back to FERC for further proceedings. Upon issuance of \n104\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 — Regulatory Matters\nthe mandate from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, we began operating under an annual license, which renews automatically, containing the same terms as the license that was in effect prior to the 2021 FERC order. \nMDE informed us that as a result of the U.S. Court of Appeals decision, they would be resuming their administrative reconsideration of the 401 Certification. In response to the procedure outlined by the MDE, supplemental briefs on the 401 Certification were filed by the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association and Waterkeepers Chesapeake (jointly) and us.  In addition, we filed a supplemental reply brief. We are currently participating in mediation with MDE and the parties that sought reconsideration of the 401 Certification. We are unable to further predict the outcome of this proceeding at this time. Depreciation provisions continue to assume operation through 2071 given our expectation that a 50-year license will be issued. \nPeach Bottom Units 2 and 3.\n  In March 2020, the NRC approved a second \n20-year\n license renewal for Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3. As a result, Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3 were granted the authority to operate through 2053 and 2054, respectively. \nNotwithstanding its 2020 approval, in February 2022, the NRC took action to modify Peach Bottom's subsequently renewed licenses in response to a request for hearing that the NRC had not previously adjudicated. In its February 2022 decision, the NRC reversed itself and concluded that the previous environmental review required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for the Peach Bottom subsequently renewed licenses was incomplete because it did not adequately address environmental impacts resulting from renewing the units’ licenses for an additional \n20\n years. As a result, the NRC undertook a rulemaking to modify its regulations and guidance to specifically address environmental impacts during the period of subsequent license renewal. In addition, the NRC modified the expiration dates for the Peach Bottom licenses from 2053 and 2054 to 2033 and 2034, respectively, pending the completion of the updated NEPA analysis. The NRC approved final revisions to the rule in May 2024, and we have begun working with the NRC to close out the remaining environmental issues and restore the Peach Bottom expiration dates to 2053 and 2054. Depreciation provisions and ARO assumed retirement dates continue to assume Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3 will operate through 2053 and 2054, respectively, given our expectation that the previously approved expiration dates will be restored.\n4.    \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers \nWe recognize revenue from contracts with customers to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Our primary sources of revenue include competitive sales of power, natural gas, and other energy-related products and sustainable solutions. The performance obligations, revenue recognition, and payment terms associated with these sources of revenue are further discussed in the table below. There are no significant financing components for these sources of revenue. \nUnless otherwise noted, for each of the significant revenue categories and related performance obligations described below, we have the right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value transferred to the customer for the performance completed to date. Therefore, we generally recognize revenue in the amount for which we have the right to invoice the customer. As a result, there are generally no significant judgments used in determining or allocating the transaction price.\n105\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nRevenue Source\nDescription\nPerformance Obligation\nTiming of Revenue Recognition\nPayment Terms \nPower Sales \nSales of power and other energy-related products to wholesale and retail customers through our customer-facing business\nVarious, including the delivery of power (generally delivered over time) and other energy-related products such as capacity (generally delivered over time), CMCs, ZECs, RECs or other ancillary services (generally delivered at a point in time)\nConcurrently as power is generated for bundled power sale contracts\n (a)\nGenerally within the month following delivery to the customer\nNatural Gas Sales \nSales of natural gas to wholesale and retail customers through our customer-facing business\nVarious, including the delivery of natural gas (generally delivered overtime) and sustainable natural gas attributes (generally delivered at a point in time)\nOver time as the natural gas is delivered to the customer\nGenerally within the month following delivery to the customer\nOther Products and Services\nSales of other energy-related products and sustainable solutions, such as long-term construction and installation of energy efficiency assets and new power generating facilities, primarily to C&I customers\nConstruction and/or installation of the asset for the customer\nRevenues and associated costs are recognized throughout the contract term using an input method to measure progress towards completion\n(b)\nGenerally within 30 or 45 days from the invoice date\n__________\n(a)\nCertain contracts may contain limits on the total amount of revenue we are able to collect over the entire term of the contract. In such cases, we estimate the total consideration expected to be received over the term of the contract net of the constraint and allocate the expected consideration to the performance obligations in the contract such that revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the entire contract as the performance obligations are satisfied.\n(b)\nThe method recognizes revenue based on the various inputs used to satisfy the performance obligation, such as costs incurred and total labor hours expended. The total amount of revenue that will be recognized is based on the agreed upon contractually-stated amount. The average contract term for these projects is approximately \n18\n months.\nWe incur incremental costs in order to execute certain retail power and gas sales contracts. These costs, which primarily relate to retail broker fees and sales commissions, are capitalized when incurred as contract acquisition costs and generally amortized over the corresponding term of the contract. These capitalized costs and related amortization were not material as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nContract Balances\nContract Assets\nWe record contract assets for the revenue recognized on the construction and installation of energy efficiency assets and new power generating facilities before we have an unconditional right to bill for and receive the consideration from the customer. These contract assets are subsequently reclassified to receivables when the right to payment becomes unconditional. We record contract assets and contract receivables in Other current assets and Customer accounts receivable, net, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n106\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the contract assets reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: \n2024\n2023\nBeginning balance as of January 1\n$\n82\n \n$\n130\n \nAmounts reclassified to receivables\n(\n95\n)\n(\n127\n)\nRevenues recognized\n103\n \n79\n \nEnding balance as of December 31 \n$\n90\n \n$\n82\n \nContract Liabilities\nWe record contract liabilities when consideration is received or due prior to the satisfaction of the performance obligations. We record contract liabilities in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These contract liabilities primarily relate to upfront consideration received or due for equipment service plans, the Mystic COS, and the Illinois ZEC program. The Mystic COS, which ended in May 2024, included upfront consideration received that differs from the recognized earnings over the cost of the service period. The Illinois ZEC program introduces an annual cap on the total consideration to be received by us for each delivery period. The ZEC price is established on a per MWh of production basis with a maximum annual cap for total compensation to be received for each planning year (June through May), while requiring delivery of all ZECs produced by our participating facilities during each delivery period. ZECs delivered to Illinois utilities in excess of the annual cost cap may be paid in subsequent years if the payments do not exceed the prescribed annual cost cap for that year. The contract liability balance as of December 31, 2024 primarily related to equipment service plans. The balance as of December 31, 2023 primarily related to equipment services plans and the Mystic COS.\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the contract liabilities reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets: \n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance as of January 1\n$\n40\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n75\n \nConsideration received\n120\n \n331\n \n339\n \nRevenues recognized\n(\n127\n)\n(\n338\n)\n(\n367\n)\nEnding balance as of December 31\n$\n33\n \n$\n40\n \n$\n47\n \nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nThe following table shows the amounts of future revenues expected to be recorded in each year for performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of December 31, 2024. This disclosure only includes contracts for which the total consideration is fixed and determinable at contract inception. The average contract term varies by customer type and commodity but ranges from one month to several years. This disclosure excludes mark-to-market derivatives and certain power and gas sales contracts which contain variable volumes and/or variable pricing.\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029 and thereafter\nTotal\nRemaining performance obligations\n$\n251\n \n$\n211\n \n$\n147\n \n$\n95\n \n$\n211\n \n$\n915\n \nTransaction Price Allocated to Previously Satisfied Performance Obligations \nOur Clinton and Quad Cities units contract with certain utilities in Illinois that require delivery of all ZECs produced during each planning year (June through May), with total compensation limited by an annual cap for each planning year designed to limit the cost of ZECs to each utility's customers. ZECs delivered that, if paid, would result in the annual cap being exceeded may be paid in subsequent years at the vintage year price as long as the payments would not exceed the annual cap in the year paid. In each planning year since the program commenced in June 2017, we delivered ZECs to the utilities in excess of the annual compensation cap.\nThe ZEC price and annual compensation cap effective for each planning year are administratively determined by the IPA. For the June 2023 through May 2024 planning year, the ZEC price was established at $0.30 per ZEC, subject to an annual cap of $224 million. ZECs generated and delivered during the planning year did not exceed \n107\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nthe annual cap, providing capacity to compensate for ZECs delivered in prior planning years in excess of the compensation cap. In 2023, we recognized $\n218\n million of revenue as a receivable for ZECs delivered in prior planning years, with payment received in the third quarter of 2024. For the June 2024 through May 2025 planning year, the ZEC price has been established at $9.38 per ZEC, subject to an annual cap of $222 million. Revenue recognized in 2024 for ZECs delivered in prior planning years was not material.\nRevenue Disaggregation \nWe disaggregate the revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. See Note 5 — Segment Information for the presentation of revenue disaggregation.\n5.    \nSegment Information \nOperating segments are determined based on information used by the CODM in deciding how to evaluate performance and allocate resources. We have \nfive\n reportable segments consisting of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and all other power regions referred to collectively as “Other Power Regions.” \nThe basis for our reportable segments is the integrated management of our electricity business that is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple supply sources to provide electricity through various distribution channels (wholesale and retail). Our hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned to these same geographic regions. Descriptions of each of our \nfive\n reportable segments are as follows:\n•\nMid-Atlantic \nrepresents operations in the eastern half of PJM, which includes New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, the District of Columbia, and parts of Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\n•\nMidwest\n represents operations in the western half of PJM and the United States footprint of MISO, excluding MISO’s Southern Region.\n•\nNew York\n represents operations within NYISO.\n•\nERCOT\n represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas that covers a majority of the state of Texas.\n•\nOther Power Regions:\n•\nNew England\n represents operations within ISO-NE.\n•\nSouth\n represents operations in FRCC, MISO’s Southern Region, and the remaining portions of SERC not included within MISO or PJM.\n•\nWest \nrepresents operations in WECC, which includes CAISO.\n•\nCanada \nrepresents operations across the entire country of Canada and includes AESO, OIESO, and the Canadian portion of MISO.\nConstellation's CEO is considered the CODM and evaluates the performance of our electric business activities and allocates resources based on segment RNF, primarily through review of budget-to-actual variance analyses. RNF is Operating revenues net of Purchased power and fuel expenses. We believe this is a useful measurement of operational performance, although it is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. In our evaluation of operating segments, we noted the CODM reviews a variety of performance and profitability measures at a consolidated level with a primary focus on RNF reporting at the regional level. Our operating revenues include all sales to third parties as well as government assistance. Purchased power and fuel expenses are considered the significant segment expense. Purchased power costs include all costs associated with the procurement and supply of electricity including capacity, energy, and ancillary services. Fuel expense includes the fuel costs for our owned generation and fuel costs associated with tolling agreements. The results of our other business activities are not regularly reviewed by the CODM and are therefore not classified as operating segments or included in the regional reportable segment amounts. These activities include wholesale \n108\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 — Segment Information\nand retail sales of natural gas, energy-related sales in the United Kingdom, as well as sales of other energy-related products and sustainable solutions that are not significant to our overall results of operations. Further, our unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedging activities and our amortization of certain intangible assets and liabilities relating to commodity contracts recorded at fair value from mergers and acquisitions are also excluded from the regional reportable segment amounts. The CODM does not use a measure of total assets in making decisions regarding allocating resources to or assessing the performance of these reportable segments.\nThe following tables disaggregate the revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The disaggregation of revenues reflects our power sales by geographic region. \nThe following tables, which relate directly to our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, provide the reconciliation of operating revenues, purchased power and fuel expenses, and RNF for reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.  \n \n2024\n \nRevenues from contracts with customers\nOther\nrevenues\n(a)\nTotal Operating revenues\nTotal Purchased power and fuel expenses\nTotal RNF\nMid-Atlantic\n$\n5,429\n \n$\n93\n \n$\n5,522\n \n$\n(\n2,442\n)\n$\n3,080\n \nMidwest\n3,848\n \n957\n \n4,805\n \n(\n1,603\n)\n3,202\n \nNew York\n1,937\n \n113\n \n2,050\n \n(\n597\n)\n1,453\n \nERCOT\n1,053\n \n497\n \n1,550\n \n(\n503\n)\n1,047\n \nOther Power Regions \n4,749\n \n757\n \n5,506\n \n(\n4,238\n)\n1,268\n \nTotal Reportable Segments\n17,016\n \n2,417\n \n19,433\n \n(\n9,383\n)\n10,050\n \nOther\n(b)\n1,948\n \n2,187\n \n4,135\n \n(\n2,036\n)\n2,099\n \nTotal Consolidated Results\n$\n18,964\n \n$\n4,604\n \n$\n23,568\n \n$\n(\n11,419\n)\n$\n12,149\n \n109\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 — Segment Information\n \n2023\n \nRevenues from contracts with customers\nOther\nrevenues\n(a)\nTotal Operating revenues\nTotal Purchased power and fuel expenses\nTotal RNF\nMid-Atlantic\n$\n5,453\n \n$\n(\n315\n)\n$\n5,138\n \n$\n(\n2,214\n)\n$\n2,924\n \nMidwest\n4,846\n \n(\n188\n)\n4,658\n \n(\n1,403\n)\n3,255\n \nNew York\n1,910\n \n111\n \n2,021\n \n(\n770\n)\n1,251\n \nERCOT\n1,232\n \n114\n \n1,346\n \n(\n764\n)\n582\n \nOther Power Regions \n4,956\n \n895\n \n5,851\n \n(\n4,611\n)\n1,240\n \nTotal Reportable Segments\n18,397\n \n617\n \n19,014\n \n(\n9,762\n)\n9,252\n \nOther\n(b)\n2,444\n \n3,460\n \n5,904\n \n(\n6,239\n)\n(\n335\n)\nTotal Consolidated Results\n$\n20,841\n \n$\n4,077\n \n$\n24,918\n \n$\n(\n16,001\n)\n$\n8,917\n \n \n2022\n \nRevenues from contracts with customers\nOther\nrevenues\n(a)\nTotal Operating revenues\nTotal Purchased power and fuel expenses\nTotal RNF\nMid-Atlantic\n$\n5,264\n \n$\n(\n100\n)\n$\n5,164\n \n$\n(\n3,026\n)\n$\n2,138\n \nMidwest\n5,164\n \n(\n514\n)\n4,650\n \n(\n1,886\n)\n2,764\n \nNew York\n2,004\n \n(\n409\n)\n1,595\n \n(\n528\n)\n1,067\n \nERCOT\n954\n \n589\n \n1,543\n \n(\n1,136\n)\n407\n \nOther Power Regions \n5,035\n \n1,697\n \n6,732\n \n(\n5,811\n)\n921\n \nTotal Reportable Segments\n18,421\n \n1,263\n \n19,684\n \n(\n12,387\n)\n7,297\n \nOther\n(b)\n3,150\n \n1,606\n \n4,756\n \n(\n5,075\n)\n(\n319\n)\nTotal Consolidated Results\n(c)\n$\n21,571\n \n$\n2,869\n \n$\n24,440\n \n$\n(\n17,462\n)\n$\n6,978\n \n__________\n(a)\nIncludes revenues from nuclear PTCs beginning in 2024 as well as derivatives and leases.

The nuclear PTC provides a transferable credit up to $15 per MWh (a base credit of $3 per MWh with a five times multiplier provided certain prevailing wage requirements are met) and is subject to phase-out when annual gross receipts are between $25.00 per MWh and $43.75 per MWh. We have evaluated and expect to meet the annual prevailing wage requirements at all our nuclear units and are eligible for the five times multiplier. Both the amount of the PTC and the gross receipts thresholds adjust for inflation after 2024 through the duration of the program based on the GDP price deflator for the preceding calendar year. The benefits of the PTC may be realized through a credit against our federal income taxes or transferred via sale to an unrelated party.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income include a nuclear PTC benefit of approximately $\n2,080\n million in Operating revenues. Our estimate required the exercise of judgment in determining the amount of nuclear PTC expected for each of our nuclear units. The nuclear PTC continues to be the subject of additional guidance, which may be issued from the U.S. Treasury and IRS sometime in 2025, and may materially impact the total amount of the benefits we receive. \nNuclear PTCs are initially recorded within Other deferred debits and other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified as a reduction to Accounts payable and accrued expenses when used to reduce our federal income tax payable, or an increase in Cash and cash equivalents or Other current assets when sold, depending on the specific payment terms of each contract. \nIn 2024, we executed agreements for the sale of $\n1,750\n million of nuclear PTCs to unaffiliated third parties at a nominal discount, with approximately $\n1,570\n million of cash proceeds received upon sale (included within Cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows) and approximately $\n95\n million to be received in the first quarter of 2025. As of December 31, 2024, our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect approximately $\n185\n million of estimated nuclear PTCs within \nOther deferred debits and other assets\n, $\n95\n million within \nOther current assets\n, and a reduction to \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n of $\n150\n million for estimated nuclear PTCs that we have utilized as a credit against our current federal income taxes payable.\nMany of the state-sponsored programs providing compensation for the emissions-free attributes of generation from certain of our nuclear units include contractual or other provisions that require us to refund that compensation up to the amount of the nuclear PTC received or pass through the entirety of the nuclear PTC received. As of December 31, 2024, we have recognized approximately $\n1,030\n million of estimated payables within \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n or as offsets to Customer accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with programs requiring refunds or pass through of the nuclear PTC. We recognized a reduction to \nnet operating revenue\n of approximately $\n50\n million (pre-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2024 associated with these programs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. As with the actual amount of the PTC earned, any change resulting from additional guidance received may materially impact amounts due under state-sponsored programs.\n \n7.    \nAccounts Receivable \nAllowance for Credit Losses on Accounts Receivable \nThe following table presents the rollforward of allowance for credit losses on Customer accounts receivable, which does not include any allowance related to the sales of customer accounts receivable disclosed below.

On December 31, 2024, we amended the Facility. We will no longer sell receivables to the Purchasers and all outstanding receivables were assigned back to us. Prior to the amendment, the maximum funding limit of the Facility was $\n1.1\n billion. Under the Facility's prior terms, NER sold eligible short-term customer accounts receivable to the Purchasers in exchange for cash and subordinated interest. The transfers were reported as sales of receivables in the consolidated financial statements. The subordinated interest in collections upon the receivables sold to the Purchasers was referred to as the DPP, which was reflected in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets prior to the amendment. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements for terms of the amended Facility.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of the sale of certain receivables:\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nDerecognized receivables transferred at fair value\n$\n—\n \n$\n1,516\n \nLess: Cash proceeds received\n—\n \n300\n \nDPP\n(a)\n$\n—\n \n$\n1,216\n \n_________\n(a)\nAs a result of the Facility amendment, DPP of $\n1,529\n million was reclassified to Customer accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nLoss on sale of receivables\n(a)\n$\n61\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n69\n \n_________\n(a)\nReflected in Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

The collection and reinvestment of DPP is recognized in Cash flows from investing activities in the Collection of DPP, net line in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, which were $\n10,217\n million, $\n7,340\n million, and $\n4,964\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As a result of the receivables being assigned back to NER under the amended Facility, NER forgave any and all remaining DPP owed by the Purchasers. The reassignment of receivables and unwind of DPP will be treated as a non-cash activity and therefore have no impact in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \n112\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 7 — Accounts Receivable\nSee Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 21 — Variable Interest Entities for additional information on DPP and NER, respectively.\nOther Sales of Customer Accounts Receivables \nWe are required, under supplier tariffs, to sell customer receivables to certain utility companies.

The estimated useful lives of our nuclear stations generally include expectations for an additional \n20-year\n term beyond current license expiration, except for Calvert Cliffs, FitzPatrick, Limerick, NMP Unit 2, Salem, and STP where depreciation provisions correspond with the expiration of the current NRC operating license. Generally, our oil and gas plants have estimated useful lives of \n40\n-\n45\n year with wind and solar generating facilities having estimated useful lives of \n25\n and \n35\n years, respectively. The estimated useful lives of our hydroelectric facilities also generally align with their FERC operating licenses. Conowingo depreciation provisions are based on an estimated useful life through 2071, in anticipation that a 50-year license will be issued. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding license renewals for Peach Bottom and Conowingo.\nAnnual depreciation rates for electric generation were \n3.43\n%, \n3.26\n%, and \n3.46\n% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Nuclear fuel amortization is charged to fuel expense using the unit-of-production method and not included in the annual depreciation rates.

To estimate our nuclear decommissioning obligations we use a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models, and discount rates. We update our AROs annually, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on our review of updated cost studies and our annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios. \nThe financial statement impact for changes in the ARO, on an individual unit basis, due to the changes in and timing of estimated cash flows generally result in a corresponding change in the unit’s ARC in Property, plant, and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the ARO decreases for a Non-Regulatory Agreement Unit without any remaining ARC, the corresponding change is recorded as a decrease in Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, whereas the corresponding decrease for Regulatory Agreement Units without any remaining ARC results in an increase to the Payables related to Regulatory Agreement Units in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the nuclear decommissioning AROs reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2024:\n2024\n2023\nBeginning balance as of January 1\n$\n13,891\n \n$\n12,500\n \nNet (decrease) increase due to changes in, and timing of, estimated future cash flows\n(\n2,299\n)\n411\n \nAccretion expense\n640\n \n582\n \nCosts incurred related to decommissioning plants\n(a) \n(\n24\n)\n(\n31\n)\nAcquisition of joint ownership in STP\n(b) \n(\n22\n)\n429\n \nEnding balance as of December 31\n(c)\n$\n12,186\n \n$\n13,891\n \n__________\n114\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations\n(a)\nWe began decommissioning Crane upon permanently ceasing operations in 2019 and in 2024 commenced efforts to restart.

Generally, NDT funds established for a particular unit may not be used to fund the decommissioning obligations of any other unit.\nThe NDT funds associated with our nuclear units have been funded with amounts collected from the previous owners and their respective utility customers. PECO is authorized to collect funds, in revenues, through regulated rates for decommissioning the former PECO nuclear plants, and these collections are scheduled through the operating lives of these former PECO plants. The amounts collected from PECO customers are remitted to us and deposited into the NDT funds for the unit for which funds are collected. Every five years, PECO files a rate adjustment with the PAPUC that reflects PECO’s calculations of the estimated amount needed to decommission each of the former PECO units based on updated fund balances and estimated decommissioning costs.  The rate adjustment is used to determine the amount collectible from PECO customers. In March 2022, PECO filed its Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Adjustment with the PAPUC proposing an annual recovery from customers of approximately $\n4\n million. In August 2022, the PAPUC approved the filing, and the new rates became effective January 1, 2023.\nAdditionally, for the STP units, we maintain decommissioning trust funds for those units proportionate to our ownership. We also retain the authority through the PUCT to obtain additional decommissioning funding through AEP Texas and CenterPoint. Every five years, owners of each Texas jurisdictional nuclear generation unit are \n115\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations\nrequired to file an update of decommissioning costs with the PUCT in support of appropriate utility rates for decommissioning trust funding. In July 2023, the decommissioning cost update for our share of the STP decommissioning obligation was filed, proposing annual funding amounts from AEP Texas and CenterPoint totaling approximately $\n1\n million. In March 2024, the PUCT approved the filing, and AEP Texas and CenterPoint tariffs were adjusted accordingly in May and August 2024, respectively.\nAny shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning, determined for each generating station unit, are generally required to be funded by us, with the exception of STP and the former PECO units. We have recourse to collect additional amounts from the respective utility customers through the utility commissions for the former PECO units and STP in the event of a shortfall of NDT funds. Collection of additional amounts for the former PECO units are subject to certain limitations and thresholds, as prescribed by an order from the PAPUC that limits collection of amounts associated with the first $\n50\n million of any shortfall of trust funds compared to decommissioning costs, as well as \n5\n% of any additional shortfalls, on an aggregate basis for all former PECO units. The initial $\n50\n million and up to \n5\n% of any additional shortfalls would be borne by us. No such limitations exist for the STP units, however PUCT regulations require that any funds remaining in the trust after completion of decommissioning to be refunded to utility customers in a manner determined by the commission. Aside from the former PECO units and STP, no recourse exists to collect additional amounts from utility customers for any of our other nuclear units. \nWith respect to the Regulatory Agreement Units, any funds remaining in the NDTs after all decommissioning has been completed are required to be refunded to the respective utility customers, subject to certain limitations that allow sharing of excess funds with us related to the former PECO units. With respect to our other nuclear units, we retain any funds remaining after decommissioning. However, in connection with CENG's acquisition of the NMP and Ginna plants and settlements with certain regulatory agencies, certain conditions pertaining to NDT funds apply that, if met, could possibly result in obligations to make payments to certain third parties (clawbacks). For NMP and Ginna, the clawback provisions are triggered only in the event that the required decommissioning activities are discontinued or not started or completed in a timely manner. In the event that the clawback provisions are triggered for NMP, then, depending upon the triggering event, an amount equal to \n50\n% of the total amount withdrawn from the funds for non-decommissioning activities as defined in the agreement or \n50\n% of any excess funds in the trust funds above the amounts required for decommissioning (including SNF management and site restoration) is to be paid to the NMP sellers. In the event that the clawback provisions are triggered for Ginna, then an amount equal to any estimated cost savings realized by not completing any of the required decommissioning activities is to be paid to the Ginna sellers. We expect to comply with applicable regulations and timely commence and complete all required decommissioning activities.\nWe had NDT funds totali\nng $\n17,321\n million\n \nand $\n16,398\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of \nDecember 31, 2024, \n$\n16\n million\n of the NDT funds were current and included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023, \nnone\n of the NDT funds were reflected in Other current assets. See Note 22 — Supplemental Financial Information for additional information on activities of the NDT funds.\nAccounting Implications of the Regulatory Agreement Units\nSee Note 1 — Basis of Presentation for additional information on the accounting policy for Regulatory Agreement Units. \nFor the former PECO units and STP, given the symmetric settlement provisions that allow for continued recovery of decommissioning costs from the respective utility customers in the event of a shortfall and the obligation for us to ultimately return excess funds to the respective utility customers (on an aggregate basis for all seven former PECO units and on the underlying utility customer basis for STP) decommissioning-related activities are generally offset in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, regardless of whether the NDT funds are expected to exceed or fall short of the total estimated decommissioning obligation. The offset of decommissioning-related activities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income results in an equal adjustment to noncurrent payables or noncurrent receivables. Any changes to the existing PECO or STP regulatory agreements could impact our ability to offset decommissioning-related activities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, and the potential impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material.\n116\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations\nFor the former ComEd units, given no further recovery from ComEd customers is permitted and we retain an obligation to ultimately return any unused NDTs to ComEd customers (on a unit-by-unit basis), to the extent the related NDT investment balances are expected to exceed the total estimated decommissioning obligation for each unit, decommissioning-related activities are offset in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income which results in us recognizing a noncurrent payable. However, given the asymmetric settlement provision that does not allow for continued recovery from ComEd customers in the event of a shortfall, recognition of a receivable related to former ComEd Units is not permissible and accounting for decommissioning-related activities for that unit would not be offset, and the impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income could be material during such periods.\nThe following table presents our noncurrent payables to ComEd, PECO, CenterPoint, and AEP Texas reflected as Payables related to Regulatory Agreement Units in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nComEd\n$\n3,780\n \n$\n2,955\n \nPECO\n247\n \n278\n \nCenterPoint\n365\n \n338\n \nAEP Texas\n126\n \n117\n \nPayables related to Regulatory Agreement Units\n$\n4,518\n \n$\n3,688\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, decommissioning-related activities for all of the former ComEd units, except for Zion (see Zion Station Decommissioning below), are currently offset in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nThe decommissioning-related activities for the Non-Regulatory Agreement Units are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income within Operating and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization expense, and Other, net.\nZion Station Decommissioning \nIn 2010, we completed an asset sale agreement under which ZionSolutions assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station and we transferred to ZionSolutions substantially all the Zion Station’s assets, including the related NDT funds. In November 2023, ZionSolutions completed its contractual obligations and transferred the NRC license back to us. We will store the SNF at Zion Station until it is transferred to the DOE for ultimate disposal and complete all remaining decommissioning activities associated with the SNF dry storage facility.\nAny shortage of funds necessary to maintain the SNF and decommission the SNF storage facility is ultimately required to be funded by us. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the ARO associated with Zion's SNF storage facility \nis $\n163\n million\n and $\n139\n million, respectively, and the NDT funds available to fund this obligation ar\ne $\n63\n million\n and $\n62\n million, respectively.\nNRC Minimum Funding Requirements\nNRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts for radiological decommissioning of the facility at the end of its life. The estimated decommissioning obligations are calculated using an NRC methodology that is different from the ARO recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily due to differences in the type of costs included in the estimates, the basis for estimating such costs, and assumptions regarding the decommissioning alternatives to be used, potential license renewals, decommissioning cost escalation, and the growth rate in the NDT funds. Under NRC regulations, if the minimum funding requirements for radiological decommissioning calculated under the NRC methodology are greater than the future value of the NDT funds, also calculated under the NRC methodology, then the NRC requires resolution of the shortfalls which could include further funding or other financial guarantees.\n117\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations\nKey assumptions used in the minimum funding calculation for radiological decommissioning costs using the NRC methodology at December 31, 2024 include: (1) consideration of costs only for the removal of radiological contamination at each unit; (2) the option on a unit-by-unit basis to use generic, non-site specific cost estimates; (3) consideration of only one decommissioning scenario for each unit; (4) the plants cease operation at the end of their current license lives (with no assumed license renewals for those units that have not already received renewals); (5) the assumption of current nominal dollar cost estimates that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of decommissioning, nor discounted using the CARFR; and (6) assumed annual after-tax returns on the NDT funds of \n2\n%\n (\n3\n%\n for the former PECO units, as specified by the PAPUC).\nIn contrast, the key criteria and assumptions used by us to determine the ARO and to forecast the target growth in the NDT funds as of December 31, 2024 include: (1) the use of site specific cost estimates that are updated at least once every five years; (2) the inclusion in the ARO estimate of all legally unavoidable costs required to decommission the unit (e.g., radiological decommissioning and full site restoration for certain units, on-site SNF maintenance and storage subsequent to ceasing operations and until DOE acceptance, and disposal of certain LLRW); (3) as applicable, the consideration of multiple scenarios where decommissioning and site restoration activities, as applicable, are completed under possible scenarios ranging from \n10\n to \n70\n years after the cessation of plant operations or the end of the current licensed operating life; (4) the consideration of multiple end of life scenarios; (5) the measurement of the obligation at the present value of the future estimated costs and an annual accretion of the ARO; and (6) an estimated targeted annual pre-tax return on the NDT funds of \n6.3\n%\n to \n7.1\n%\n (as compared to a historical 5-year annual average pre-tax return of\n approximately \n6.5\n%\n).\nWe are required to provide to the NRC a biennial report by unit (annually for units that have been retired or are within five years of license expiration), based on values as of December 31, addressing our ability to meet the NRC minimum funding levels. Depending on the value of the trust funds, we may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through surety bonds, letters of credit, or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met. As a result, our cash flows and financial position may be significantly adversely affected.\nWe filed our biennial decommissioning funding status report with the NRC in March 2023 for all units, including our shutdown units, except for Zion Station which was included in a separate report to the NRC submitted by ZionSolutions, LLC. The status report demonstrated adequate decommissioning funding assurance based on trust fund values as of December 31, 2022 for all units except for Peach Bottom Unit 1. As a former PECO plant, financial assurance for decommissioning Peach Bottom Unit 1 is provided by the NDT fund, collections from PECO customers, and the ability to adjust those collections in accordance with the approved PAPUC tariff. See NDT Funds section above for additional information. Additionally, the STP units demonstrated adequate decommissioning funding assurance as of December 31, 2022 in the decommissioning funding status report filed with the NRC by STPNOC in March 2023. \nIn March 2024, we filed our annual decommissioning funding status report with the NRC for our shutdown units, including Zion Station which was transferred back to us in November 2023. The status report demonstrated adequate decommissioning funding assurance based on trust fund values as of December 31, 2023 for all shutdown units except for Peach Bottom Unit 1. Financial assurance for decommissioning Peach Bottom Unit 1 is provided by collections from PECO customers. Additionally in March 2024, STPNOC filed the decommissioning funding status report for STP. The status report demonstrated adequate funding assurance as of December 31, 2023.\nWe will file the next decommissioning funding status report with the NRC in \nM\narch 2025. This report will reflect the status of decommissioning funding as of December 31, 2024 for all units, except for STP which will be filed separately by STPNOC. We expect the funding status reports to demonstrate adequate funding assurance based on the value of trust funds as of December 31, 2024, for all units except for Peach Bottom Unit 1. Financial assurance for decommissioning Peach Bottom Unit 1 is provided by the collections from PECO customers as mentioned above.\nAs the future values of trust funds change due to market conditions, the NRC minimum funding status of our units will change. In addition, if changes occur to the regulatory agreements with the PAPUC or the PUCT that currently allow amounts to be collected from utility customers for decommissioning the former PECO and STP units, the NRC minimum funding status of those plants could change at subsequent NRC filing dates.\n118\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations\nNon-Nuclear Asset Retirement Obligations \nWe have AROs for plant closure costs associated with our natural gas, oil, and renewable generating facilities, including asbestos abatement, removal of certain storage tanks, restoring leased land to the condition it was in prior to construction of renewable generating stations, disposal of hazardous materials, and other decommissioning-related activities.

See discussion below under the Tax Matters Agreement for responsibility of taxes of these open years.\nConstellation participates in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process which provides the opportunity to resolve complex tax matters with the IRS prior to filing its federal income tax returns with a goal to achieve certainty with respect to tax matters. Constellation entered the program for the 2024 tax year.\nOther Tax Matters\nTax Matters Agreement\nIn connection with the separation, we entered a TMA with Exelon. The TMA governs the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations between us and Exelon after the separation with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax returns, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns.\nResponsibility and Indemnification for Taxes\n.\n  As a former subsidiary of Exelon, we have joint and several liability with Exelon to the IRS and certain state jurisdictions relating to the taxable periods that we were included \n124\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\n Note 13 — Income Taxes\nin federal and state filings. However, the TMA specifies the portion of this tax liability for which we will bear contractual responsibility, and we and Exelon agreed to indemnify each other against any amounts for which such indemnified party is not responsible. Specifically, we will be liable for taxes due and payable in connection with tax returns that we are required to file. We will also be liable for our share of certain taxes required to be paid by Exelon with respect to taxable years or periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the separation to the extent that we would have been responsible for such taxes under the Exelon tax sharing agreement then existing. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect $\n39\n million and $\n37\n million in Other deferred credits and other liabilities, respectively, for tax liabilities where we maintain contractual responsibility to Exelon. There were \nno\n payables in Accounts payable and accrued expenses for both periods.\nTax Refunds and Attributes\n.  \nThe TMA provides for the allocation of certain pre-closing tax attributes between us and Exelon. Tax attributes will be allocated in accordance with the principles set forth in the existing Exelon tax sharing agreement, unless otherwise required by law. Under the TMA, we will be entitled to refunds for taxes for which we are responsible. In addition, it is expected that Exelon will have tax attributes that may be used to offset Exelon’s future tax liabilities. A significant portion of such attributes were generated by our business. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, we had $\n138\n million and $\n336\n million in Other accounts receivable and $\n201\n million and $\n178\n million in Other deferred debits and other assets for the reclassified tax attributes expected to be utilized by Exelon after separation in accordance with the terms of the TMA.\n \n14.    \nRetirement Benefits \nDefined Benefit Pension and OPEB\nThe majority of current employees participate in the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans that we sponsor.  As the plan sponsor, our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect underfunded pension and OPEB liabilities equal to an excess of either the PBO or APBO over the fair value of the plan assets, consistent with a single employer benefit plan. Newly hired employees are generally not eligible for either pension or OPEB benefits; instead, these employees are eligible to receive an enhanced non-discretionary fixed employer contribution under our sponsored defined contribution savings plan.\nBenefit Obligations, Plan Assets, and Funded Status\nAs of February 1, 2022, we assumed from Exelon the PBO, APBO, and plan assets for our plan participants in connection with the separation. The defined benefit pension and OPEB plans were remeasured to determine the obligations and related plan assets to be transferred to us as of that date. The pension assets allocated to us were based on the rules prescribed by ERISA for transfers of assets in connection with a pension plan separation. A portion of the Exelon OPEB plan assets, which are held in VEBA trusts, were also allocated to us separately for each funding vehicle based on the ratio of the APBO assumed by us to the total APBO attributed to each funding vehicle. As a result of the remeasurement completed at separation we recognized $\n2,006\n million (after-tax) in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for actuarial losses and prior service costs that had accrued over the lives of the plans prior to separation, primarily based on our proportionate share of the total projected pension and OPEB obligations at Exelon prior to separation.\nWe use a December 31 measurement date for our pension and OPEB obligations and the related plan assets. The actuarial losses experienced upon remeasurement as of December 31, 2024 were offset against AOCI, net of deferred taxes.

The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is impacted by several assumptions and inputs, as shown below, among other factors. When developing the required assumptions, we consider historical information as well as future expectations.\nDiscount Rate.\n  The discount rates are determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high-quality non-callable (or callable with make whole provisions) bonds with similar maturities to the related pension and OPEB obligations. The spot rates are used to discount the estimated future benefit distribution amounts under the pension and OPEB plans. The discount rate is the single level rate that \n128\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nproduces the same result as the spot rate curve. We utilize an analytical tool developed by our actuaries to determine the discount rates.\nExpected Rate of Return.\n  To determine the EROA, we use third-party expectations for future long-term capital market performance, weighted by our target asset class allocations. \nMortality.\n  The mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. Upon remeasurement as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we utilized the mortality tables and projection scales released by the SOA.\nThe following assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations for the plans as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Assumptions used to determine year-end benefit obligations are the assumptions used to estimate the subsequent year’s net periodic benefit costs.\nPension Benefits\nOPEB\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDiscount rate\n(a)\n5.66\n \n%\n5.17\n \n%\n5.63\n \n%\n5.15\n \n%\nInvestment crediting rate\n(b)\n5.72\n \n%\n5.07\n \n%\nN/A\nN/A\nRate of compensation increase\n(c)\n4.25\n \n%\n4.25\n \n%\n4.25\n \n%\n4.25\n \n%\nMortality table\nPri-2012 table with MP-2021 improvement scale (adjusted)\nPri-2012 table with MP-2021 improvement scale (adjusted)\nPri-2012 table with MP-2021 improvement scale (adjusted)\nPri-2012 table with MP-2021 improvement scale (adjusted)\nHealthcare cost trend on covered charges\nN/A\nN/A\n7.00\n% initial, \n5.00\n% ultimate\nInitial and ultimate rate of \n5.00\n%\n__________\n(a)\nThe discount rates above represent the blended rates used to calculate the majority of Constellation's pension and OPEB costs.\n(b)\nThe investment crediting rate above represents a weighted average rate.\n(c)\nIncludes \n4.25\n% average for the four-year period (2025-2028) and \n3.75\n% average thereafter. \n129\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 — Retirement Benefits\nThe following assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the plans for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nPension Benefits\nOPEB\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nDiscount rate\n(a)\n5.17\n \n%\n5.52\n \n%\n5.15\n \n%\n5.50\n \n%\nInvestment crediting rate\n(b)\n5.07\n \n%\n5.15\n \n%\nN/A\nN/A\nExpected return on plan assets\n(c)\n6.50\n \n%\n6.50\n \n%\n6.50\n \n%\n6.51\n \n%\nRate of compensation increase\n(d)\n4.25\n \n%\n3.75\n \n%\n4.25\n \n%\n3.75\n \n%\nMortality table\nPri-2012 table with MP-2021 improvement scale (adjusted)\nPri-2012 table with MP-2021 improvement scale (adjusted)\nPri-2012 table with MP-2021 improvement scale (adjusted)\nPri-2012 table with MP-2021 improvement scale (adjusted)\nHealthcare cost trend on covered charges\nN/A\nN/A\nInitial and ultimate rate of \n5.00\n% \nInitial and ultimate rate of \n5.00\n%\n__________\n(a)\nThe discount rates above represent the blended rates used to calculate the majority of Constellation's pension and OPEB costs.\n(b)\nThe investment crediting rate above represents a weighted average rate.\n(c)\nApplicable to our pension and OPEB plans with plan assets, with the OPEB rate representing a weighted average.\n(d)\nIncludes \n4.25\n% average for the five-year period (2025-2028) and \n3.75\n% average thereafter. \nContributions\nWe consider various factors when making qualified pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act, and management of the pension obligation. The Pension Protection Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). The projected contributions below reflect a funding strategy to make levelized annual contributions to offset some of the growth of the liability (e.g., from service cost). Based on this funding strategy and current market conditions, which are both subject to change, we made our annual qualified pension contribution in February 2025.\nOur non-qualified pension plans are not funded, given that they are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements. OPEB plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, though we have funded some of our plans. Annually, we evaluate whether additional funding for those plans is needed, and the OPEB values below reflect both plan contributions (if applicable) and benefit payments for unfunded plans.\nThe following table provides our contributions paid to our qualified pension plans, non-qualified pension plans, and OPEB plans for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPension contributions\n(a)\n$\n177\n \n$\n26\n \n$\n212\n \nOPEB contributions\n7\n \n28\n \n26\n \nTotal contributions\n$\n184\n \n$\n54\n \n$\n238\n \n__________\n(a)\nIn 2024 and 2023, our annual qualified pension contributions were $\n161\n million and $\n21\n million, respectively.

We have developed and implemented a liability hedging investment strategy for the majority of our qualified pension plans which has reduced the volatility of these pension assets relative to the associated pension obligations. We are likely to continue to gradually increase the liability hedging portfolios as the funded statuses of the plans improve. The overall objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns that will satisfy the liquidity requirements of the plans’ liabilities while striving to minimize the risk of significant losses. Trust assets for our OPEB plans are managed in a diversified investment strategy that prioritizes maximizing liquidity and returns while minimizing asset volatility.\nActual asset returns have an impact on the costs reported for the pension and OPEB plans. The actual asset returns across our pension and OPEB plans for the year ended December 31, 2024 were \n0.70\n% and \n6.80\n%, respectively, compared to an expected long-term return assumption of \n6.50\n% and \n6.50\n%, respectively. We used an EROA of \n6.50\n% and \n6.00\n% to estimate our 2025 pension and OPEB costs.\nOur pension and OPEB plan target asset allocations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAsset Category\nPension Benefits\nOPEB\nPension Benefits\nOPEB\nEquity securities\n21\n \n%\n20\n \n%\n21\n \n%\n17\n \n%\nFixed income securities\n54\n \n%\n66\n \n%\n54\n \n%\n70\n \n%\nAlternative investments\n(a)\n25\n \n%\n14\n \n%\n25\n \n%\n13\n \n%\nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n__________\n(a)\nAlternative investments include private equity, hedge funds, real assets, and private credit.\nWe evaluated our pension and OPEB plans’ asset portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2024. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual fund.

See Cash Equivalents and NDT Fund Investments in Note 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for further information.\nPension and OPEB assets also include investments in hedge funds. Hedge fund investments include those that employ a broad range of strategies to enhance returns and provide additional diversification. The fair value of hedge funds is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, hedge funds are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. We have the ability to redeem these investments at NAV or its equivalent subject to certain restrictions, which may include a lock-up period or a gate.\nDefined Contribution Savings Plan\nWe sponsor the Constellation Employee Savings Plan, a 401(k) defined contribution savings plan. The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. We match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. In addition, certain employees are eligible for a fixed non-discretionary employer contribution in lieu of a pension benefit. The employer contributions to the savings plan were $\n117\n million, $\n106\n million, and $\n90\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n15.    \nDerivative Financial Instruments \nWe use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk related to ongoing business operations.\nAuthoritative guidance requires that derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value of the derivative recognized in earnings immediately. Other accounting treatments are available through special election and designation, provided they meet specific, restrictive criteria both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis. These alternative permissible accounting treatments include NPNS, cash flow hedges, and fair value hedges. All derivative instruments, excluding NPNS and cash flow hedges, are recorded at fair value through earnings. For all NPNS derivative instruments, accounts receivable or accounts payable are recorded when derivatives settle, and revenue or expense is recognized in earnings as the underlying physical commodity is delivered.\nAuthoritative guidance about offsetting assets and liabilities requires the fair value of derivative instruments to be shown in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on a gross basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements and qualify for net presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A master netting agreement is an agreement between two counterparties that may have derivative and non-derivative contracts with each other providing for the net settlement of all referenced contracts via one payment stream, which takes place as the contracts deliver, when collateral is requested or in the event of default. In the tables below, which present fair value balances, our energy-related economic hedges and proprietary trading derivatives are shown gross. The impact of the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty that are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, as well as netting of cash collateral, including margin on exchange positions, is aggregated in the collateral and netting columns.\nOur use of cash collateral is generally unrestricted unless we were downgraded below investment grade. As our senior unsecured debt rating is currently rated at BBB+ and Baa1 by S&P and Moody's, respectively, it would take a three-notch downgrade by S&P or Moody's for our rating to go below investment grade.\nCommodity Price Risk \nWe employ established policies and procedures to manage our risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices by entering physical and financial derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards, options, and short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products. We believe these instruments, which are either determined to be non-derivative or classified as economic hedges, mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.\n133\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments\nTo the extent the amount of energy we produce or procure differs from the amount of energy we have contracted to sell, we are exposed to market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, natural gas, and other commodities. We use a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the commodity price risk of our electric generation facilities, including power and gas sales, fuel and power purchases, natural gas transportation and pipeline capacity agreements, and other energy-related products marketed and purchased. To manage these risks, we may enter fixed-price derivative or non-derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from expected sales of power and gas and purchases of power and fuel. The objectives for executing such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return. We are also exposed to differences between the locational settlement prices of certain economic hedges and the hedged generating units. This price difference is actively managed through other instruments which include derivative congestion products, whose changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period, and auction revenue rights, which are accounted for on an accrual basis.\nIn general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on owned and contracted generation positions that have not been hedged. Beginning in 2024, our existing nuclear fleet is eligible for the nuclear PTC provided by the IRA, an important tool in managing commodity price risk for each nuclear unit not already receiving state support. The nuclear PTC provides increasing levels of support as unit revenues decline below levels established in the IRA and is further adjusted for inflation after 2024 through the duration of the program based on the GDP price deflator for the preceding calendar year. See Note 6 — Government Assistance for additional information on the nuclear PTC. \nIn locations and periods where our load serving activities do not naturally offset existing generation portfolio risk, remaining commodity price exposure is managed through portfolio hedging activities. Portfolio hedging activities are generally concentrated in the prompt three years, when customer demand and market liquidity enable effective price risk mitigation. During this prompt three-year period, we seek to mitigate the price risk associated with our load serving contracts, non-nuclear generation, and any residual price risk for our nuclear generation that the nuclear PTC and state programs may not fully mitigate. We also enter transactions that further optimize the economic benefits of our overall portfolio.\nAdditionally, we are exposed to certain market risks through our proprietary trading activities. The proprietary trading activities are a complement to our energy marketing portfolio but represent a small portion of our overall energy marketing activities and are subject to limits established by the Executive Committee. Proprietary trading includes all contracts executed with the intent of benefiting from shifts or changes in market prices as opposed to those executed with the intent of hedging or managing risk. Gains and losses associated with proprietary trading are reported as Operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and are included in the Net fair value changes related to derivatives line in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, net pre-tax commodity mark-to-market gains and losses associated with proprietary trading activities were\n not material.\n134\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe following tables provide a summary of the derivative fair value balances recorded as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nDecember 31, 2024\nEconomic Hedges\nProprietary Trading\nCollateral \n(a)(b)\nNetting\n(a)\nTotal\nMark-to-market derivative assets (current)\n$\n5,518\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n152\n \n$\n(\n4,860\n)\n$\n810\n \nMark-to-market derivative assets (noncurrent)\n3,672\n \n—\n \n120\n \n(\n3,421\n)\n371\n \nTotal mark-to-market derivative assets\n9,190\n \n—\n \n272\n \n(\n8,281\n)\n1,181\n \nMark-to-market derivative liabilities (current)\n(\n5,498\n)\n—\n \n173\n \n4,860\n \n(\n465\n)\nMark-to-market derivative liabilities (noncurrent)\n(\n3,961\n)\n—\n \n141\n \n3,421\n \n(\n399\n)\nTotal mark-to-market derivative liabilities\n(\n9,459\n)\n—\n \n314\n \n8,281\n \n(\n864\n)\nTotal mark-to-market derivative net assets (liabilities)\n$\n(\n269\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n586\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n317\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nMark-to-market derivative assets (current)\n$\n7,927\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n703\n \n$\n(\n7,472\n)\n$\n1,160\n \nMark-to-market derivative assets (noncurrent)\n3,345\n \n—\n \n330\n \n(\n2,682\n)\n993\n \nTotal mark-to-market derivative assets\n11,272\n \n2\n \n1,033\n \n(\n10,154\n)\n2,153\n \nMark-to-market derivative liabilities (current)\n(\n9,019\n)\n(\n2\n)\n922\n \n7,472\n \n(\n627\n)\nMark-to-market derivative liabilities (noncurrent)\n(\n3,545\n)\n—\n \n445\n \n2,682\n \n(\n418\n)\nTotal mark-to-market derivative liabilities\n(\n12,564\n)\n(\n2\n)\n1,367\n \n10,154\n \n(\n1,045\n)\nTotal mark-to-market derivative net assets (liabilities)\n$\n(\n1,292\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n2,400\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,108\n \n_________\n(a)\nWe net all available amounts allowed in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with authoritative guidance for derivatives.

The notional amounts were $\n592\n million and $\n562\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe mark-to-market derivative assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and the mark-to-market gains and losses associated with management of interest rate and foreign currency risk for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were not material. The mark-to-market gains and losses associated with management of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk are also included in the Net fair value changes related to derivatives line in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n135\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments\nCredit Risk\nWe would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties on executed derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts as of the reporting date.\nFor commodity derivatives, we enter enabling agreements that allow for payment netting with our counterparties, which reduces our exposure to counterparty risk by providing for the offset of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. Typically, each enabling agreement is for a specific commodity and, with respect to each individual counterparty, netting is limited \nto t\nransactions involving that specific commodity product, except where master netting agreements exist with a counterparty that allows for cross product netting. In addition to payment netting language in the enabling agreement, our credit department establishes credit limits, margining thresholds and collateral requirements for each counterparty, which are defined in the derivative contracts. Counterparty credit limits are based on an internal credit review process that considers a variety of factors, including the results of a scoring model, leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings by credit rating agencies, and other risk management criteria. To the extent that a counterparty’s margining thresholds are exceeded, the counterparty is required to post collateral with us, as specified in each enabling agreement. Our credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis.\nThe following tables provide information on the credit exposure for all derivative instruments, NPNS and payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of December 31, 2024. The tables further delineate that exposure by credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties. The amounts in the tables below exclude credit risk exposure from individual retail counterparties and exposure through RTOs, ISOs, as well as NYMEX, ICE, NASDAQ, NGX, and Nodal commodity exchanges.\nRating as of December 31, 2024\nTotal Exposure Before Credit Collateral\nCredit Collateral\n(a)\nNet Exposure\nNumber of Counterparties Greater than 10% of Net Exposure\nNet Exposure of Counterparties Greater than 10% of Net Exposure\nInvestment grade\n$\n842\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n832\n \n—\n \n$\n—\n \nNon-investment grade\n25\n \n3\n \n22\n \n—\n \n—\n \nNo external ratings\nInternally rated — investment grade\n178\n \n2\n \n176\n \n—\n \n—\n \nInternally rated — non-investment grade\n137\n \n27\n \n110\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n1,182\n \n$\n42\n \n$\n1,140\n \n—\n \n$\n—\n \n__________\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2024, credit collateral held from counterparties where we had credit exposure included $\n3\n million of cash and $\n39\n million of letters of credit. \nNet Credit Exposure by Type of Counterparty\nAs of December 31, 2024\nInvestor-owned utilities, marketers, power producers\n$\n899\n \nEnergy cooperatives and municipalities\n108\n \nFinancial Institutions\n62\n \nOther\n71\n \nTotal\n$\n1,140\n \nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\nAs part of the normal course of business, we routinely enter physically or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of capacity, electricity, fuels, emissions allowances, and other energy-related products. Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral. We also enter commodity transactions on exchanges where the exchanges act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. This collateral may be \n136\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments\nposted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon our credit ratings from S&P and Moody's. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. These credit-risk-related contingent features stipulate that if we were to be downgraded or lose our investment grade credit ratings (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), we would be required to provide additional collateral. This incremental collateral requirement allows for the offsetting of derivative instruments that are assets with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists under applicable master netting agreements. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. In this case, we believe an amount of several months of future payments (e.g., capacity payments) rather than a calculation of fair value is a reasonable estimate for the contingent collateral obligation, which has been factored into the disclosure below.\nThe aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a liability position that are not fully collateralized (excluding transactions on the exchanges that are fully collateralized) is detailed in the table below:\nAs of December 31,\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\n2024\n2023\nGross fair value of derivative contracts containing this feature\n$\n(\n1,346\n)\n$\n(\n1,894\n)\nOffsetting fair value of contracts under master netting arrangements\n602\n \n925\n \nNet fair value of derivative contracts containing this feature\n$\n(\n744\n)\n$\n(\n969\n)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we posted or held the following amounts of cash collateral and letters of credit on derivative contracts with external counterparties, after giving consideration to offsetting derivative and non-derivative positions under master netting agreements.\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nCash collateral posted\n(a)\n$\n635\n \n$\n2,449\n \nLetters of credit posted\n(a)\n890\n \n777\n \nCash collateral held\n(a)\n49\n \n64\n \nLetters of credit held\n(a)\n91\n \n61\n \nAdditional collateral required in the event of a credit downgrade below investment grade (at BB+/Ba1)\n(b)(c)(d)\n1,949\n \n1,914\n \n_________\n(a)\nThe cash collateral and letters of credit amounts are inclusive of NPNS contracts.\n(b)\nCertain of our contracts contain provisions that allow a counterparty to request additional collateral when there has been a subjective determination that our credit quality has deteriorated, generally termed “adequate assurance”. Due to the subjective nature of these provisions, we estimate the amount of collateral that we may ultimately be required to post in relation to the maximum exposure with the counterparty.\n(c)\nThe downgrade collateral is inclusive of all contracts in a liability position regardless of accounting treatment and excludes any contracts with individual retail counterparties.\n(d)\nA loss of investment grade credit rating would require a three-notch downgrade from their current levels of BBB+ and Baa1 at S&P and Moody's, respectively.\nWe routinely enter supply forward contracts with certain utilities with one-sided collateral postings only from us. If market prices fall below the benchmark price levels in these contracts, the utilities are not required to post collateral. However, when market prices rise above the benchmark price levels, we are required to post collateral once certain unsecured credit limits are exceeded.\n137\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements\n16.    \nDebt and Credit Agreements \nShort-Term Borrowings\nWe meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. We may use our credit facility for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit.\nCredit Agreements \nIn February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement establishing a $\n3.5\n billion \nfive-year\n revolving credit facility (RCF) at a variable interest rate of SOFR plus \n1.275\n% and we entered into a $\n1\n billion \nfive-year\n liquidity facility with the primary purpose of supporting our letter of credit issuances. In June 2024, we amended the RCF to increase the available aggregate commitment to $\n4.5\n billion and extend the maturity date from January 2027 to June 2029. The RCF may be drawn down in the form of loans and/or to support commercial paper and letters of credit issuances. \nThe RCF fixed facility fee rate is \n0.175\n% and borrowings under the RCF bear interest at a rate based upon either the Daily Simple SOFR rate or a Term SOFR rate, plus an adder based upon our credit ratings. The adders for the Daily Simple SOFR-based borrowings and Term SOFR borrowings are \n7.5\n basis points and \n107.5\n basis points, respectively. The letters of credit bear interest at a rate of \n1.075\n%. \nIf we were to lose our investment grade credit rating, the maximum adders for Daily Simple SOFR rate borrowings and Term SOFR rate borrowings would be \n100\n basis points and \n200\n basis points, respectively. The credit agreements also require us to pay facility fees based upon the aggregate commitments. The fees vary depending upon our credit rating.\nAccounts Receivable Facility\nIn December 2024, we amended the Facility to provide NER access to revolving loans from a number of financial institutions (Lenders) secured by certain customer accounts receivable. As part of the amendment, the maximum funding limit of the of the Facility was increased from $\n1.1\n billion to $\n1.5\n billion and the maturity date was extended to December 2027. Under previous terms of the Facility, certain customer accounts receivable were sold to the Purchasers. Immediately following the amendment, all receivables previously sold were assigned back to us and receivables will no longer be sold to the Purchasers under the amendment. Subsequent to the amendment, draws and repayments related to the Facility will be reflected as Proceeds from short-term borrowings and Repayments of short-term borrowings, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Draws on the facility bear interest at a commercial paper rate or a Daily One Month Term SOFR or Term SOFR rate, plus an adder of \n0.10\n% per annum. Interest is payable monthly. There were no draws on the Facility as of December 31, 2024. \nThe amended Facility requires the balance of eligible receivables to be maintained at or above the balance of cash proceeds received from the Lenders. To the extent the eligible receivables decrease below such balance, we are required to repay cash to the Lenders. When eligible receivables exceed cash proceeds, we have the ability to increase the cash proceeds received up to the maximum funding limit.\n138\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023 we had the following aggregate bank commitments, credit facility borrowings and available capacity under our respective credit facilities:\nDecember 31, 2024\nFacility Type\nAggregate Bank\nCommitment\nFacility Draws\nOutstanding\nLetters of Credit\nOutstanding\nCommercial Paper\n(a)\nTotal Available Capacity\nRevolving Credit Facility\n$\n4,500\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n51\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4,449\n \nBilaterals\n(b)\n1,850\n \n—\n \n1,095\n \n—\n \n755\n \nAccounts Receivable Facility\n1,500\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,500\n \nLiquidity Facility\n971\n \n—\n \n907\n \n—\n \n21\n \n(c)\nProject Finance\n137\n \n—\n \n120\n \n—\n \n17\n \nTotal\n$\n8,958\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,173\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n6,742\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nRevolving Credit Facility\n$\n3,500\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n60\n \n$\n1,107\n \n$\n2,333\n \nBilaterals\n1,500\n \n—\n \n878\n \n—\n \n622\n \nLiquidity Facility\n971\n \n—\n \n720\n \n—\n \n191\n \n(c)\nProject Finance\n137\n \n—\n \n117\n \n—\n \n20\n \nTotal\n$\n6,108\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,775\n \n$\n1,107\n \n$\n3,166\n \n__________\n(a)\nOur commercial paper program is supported by the revolving credit agreement.

The lenders do not have recourse against us in the event of a default. If a specific project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific nonrecourse debt covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. In these instances, if such repayment was not satisfied, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. The potential requirement to satisfy the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives.\nAntelope Valley Solar Ranch One.  \nIn December 2011, the DOE Loan Programs Office issued a guarantee for up to $\n646\n million for a nonrecourse loan from the Federal Financing Bank to support the financing of the construction of the Antelope Valley facility. The project became fully operational in 2014. The loan will mature in January 2037. Interest rates on the loan were fixed upon each advance at a spread of 37.5 basis points above U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity. The advances were completed in December 2015 and the outstanding loan balance bears interest at an average blended interest rate of \n2.82\n%. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $\n365\n million and $\n390\n million were outstanding, respectively. In addition, we have issued letters of credit to support the equity investment in the project, with $\n36\n million outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information on interest rate swaps.\n17.    \nFair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities \nWe measure and classify fair value measurements in accordance with the hierarchy as defined by GAAP. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to liquidate as of the reporting date\n•\nLevel 2 — inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data\n•\nLevel 3 — unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models or third-party valuations for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability\nFair Value of Financial Liabilities Recorded at Amortized Cost\nThe following tables present the carrying amounts and fair values of our long-term debt and the SNF obligation as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. We have no financial liabilities classified as Level 1. \nThe carrying amounts of the short-term liabilities as presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are representative of their fair value (Level 2) because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCarrying Amount\nFair Value\nCarrying Amount\nFair Value\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLong-Term Debt, including amounts due within one year\n$\n8,412\n \n$\n7,805\n \n$\n716\n \n$\n8,521\n \n$\n7,617\n \n$\n7,140\n \n$\n774\n \n$\n7,914\n \nSNF Obligation\n1,366\n \n1,278\n \n—\n \n1,278\n \n1,296\n \n1,222\n \n—\n \n1,222\n \n142\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nWe use the following methods and assumptions to estimate fair value of our financial liabilities recorded at carrying cost:\nType\nLevel\nValuation\nLong-term Debt, including amounts due within one year\nTaxable Debt Securities\n2\nThe fair value is determined by a valuation model that is based on a conventional discounted cash flow methodology and utilizes assumptions of current market pricing curves. We obtain credit spreads based on trades of our existing debt securities as well as other issuers in the utility sector with similar credit ratings. The yields are then converted into discount rates of various tenors that are used for discounting the respective cash flows of the same tenor for each bond or note.\nVariable Rate Financing Debt\n2\nDebt rates are reset on a regular basis and the carrying value approximates fair value.\nGovernment-Backed Fixed Rate Project Financing Debt\n3\nThe fair value is similar to the process for taxable debt securities. Due to the lack of market trading data on similar debt, the discount rates are derived based on the original loan interest rate spread to the applicable U.S. Treasury rate as well as a current market curve derived from government-backed securities.\nNon-Government-Backed Fixed Rate Nonrecourse Debt\n3\nFair value is based on market and quoted prices for its own and other nonrecourse debt with similar risk profiles. Given the low trading volume in the nonrecourse debt market, the price quotes used to determine fair value will reflect certain qualitative factors, such as market conditions, investor demand, new developments that might significantly impact the project cash flows or off-taker credit, and other circumstances related to the project.\nSNF Obligation \nSNF Obligation\n2 \nThe carrying amount is derived from a contract with the DOE to provide for disposal of SNF from certain of our nuclear generating stations. See Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies for further details. When determining the fair value of the obligation, the future carrying amount of the SNF obligation is calculated by compounding the current book value of the SNF obligation at the 13-week U.S. Treasury rate. The compounded obligation amount is discounted back to present value using our discount rate, which is calculated using the same methodology as described above for the taxable debt securities, and an estimated maturity date of 2040 and 2035 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n143\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe following tables present assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\nCash equivalents\n(a)\n$\n120\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n120\n \n$\n42\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n42\n \nNDT fund investments\nCash equivalents\n(b)\n187\n \n163\n \n—\n \n350\n \n356\n \n87\n \n—\n \n443\n \nEquities\n5,230\n \n1,897\n \n—\n \n7,127\n \n4,574\n \n1,990\n \n1\n \n6,565\n \nFixed income\n2,089\n \n1,462\n \n368\n \n3,919\n \n2,043\n \n1,523\n \n277\n \n3,843\n \nPrivate credit\n—\n \n—\n \n134\n \n134\n \n—\n \n—\n \n151\n \n151\n \nAssets measured at NAV\n— \n— \n— \n5,791\n \n— \n— \n— \n5,396\n \nNDT fund investments subtotal\n(c)\n7,506\n \n3,522\n \n502\n \n17,321\n \n6,973\n \n3,600\n \n429\n \n16,398\n \nRabbi trust investments\n58\n \n41\n \n1\n \n100\n \n48\n \n33\n \n1\n \n82\n \nInvestments in equities\n389\n \n—\n \n—\n \n389\n \n372\n \n—\n \n—\n \n372\n \nMark-to-market derivative assets\nEconomic hedges\n1,278\n \n5,306\n \n2,641\n \n9,225\n \n2,330\n \n5,821\n \n3,143\n \n11,294\n \nProprietary trading\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n2\n \nEffect of netting and allocation of collateral\n(\n1,097\n)\n(\n4,790\n)\n(\n2,123\n)\n(\n8,010\n)\n(\n1,996\n)\n(\n5,195\n)\n(\n1,931\n)\n(\n9,122\n)\nMark-to-market derivative assets subtotal\n181\n \n516\n \n518\n \n1,215\n \n334\n \n626\n \n1,214\n \n2,174\n \nDPP consideration\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,216\n \n—\n \n1,216\n \nTotal assets measured at fair value\n8,254\n \n4,079\n \n1,021\n \n19,145\n \n7,769\n \n5,475\n \n1,644\n \n20,284\n \nLiabilities\nMark-to-market derivative liabilities\nEconomic hedges\n(\n1,222\n)\n(\n5,462\n)\n(\n2,778\n)\n(\n9,462\n)\n(\n2,681\n)\n(\n7,154\n)\n(\n2,736\n)\n(\n12,571\n)\nProprietary trading\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nEffect of netting and allocation of collateral\n1,180\n \n5,157\n \n2,259\n \n8,596\n \n2,587\n \n6,542\n \n2,393\n \n11,522\n \nMark-to-market derivative liabilities subtotal\n(\n42\n)\n(\n305\n)\n(\n519\n)\n(\n866\n)\n(\n94\n)\n(\n612\n)\n(\n345\n)\n(\n1,051\n)\nDeferred compensation obligation\n—\n \n(\n93\n)\n—\n \n(\n93\n)\n—\n \n(\n69\n)\n—\n \n(\n69\n)\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value\n(\n42\n)\n(\n398\n)\n(\n519\n)\n(\n959\n)\n(\n94\n)\n(\n681\n)\n(\n345\n)\n(\n1,120\n)\nTotal net assets\n$\n8,212\n \n$\n3,681\n \n$\n502\n \n$\n18,186\n \n$\n7,675\n \n$\n4,794\n \n$\n1,299\n \n$\n19,164\n \n__________\n(a)\nCEG Parent has $\n130\n million and $\n54\n million of Level 1 cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The fair values are based on observable market prices and, therefore, are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.\nNDT Fund Investments.  \nThe trust fund investments have been established to satisfy our nuclear decommissioning obligations as required by the NRC. The NDT funds hold debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds and mutual funds, which are included in equities and fixed income. Our NDT fund investments policies outline investment guidelines for the trusts and limit the trust funds’ exposures to investments in highly illiquid markets and other alternative investments, including private credit, private equity, and real assets. Investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed income securities are considered cash equivalents and included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1 or Level 2.\n146\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nEquities.\n These investments consist of individually held equity securities, equity mutual funds, and equity commingled funds in domestic and foreign markets. With respect to individually held equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are generally obtained from direct feeds from market exchanges, which we are able to independently corroborate. Equity securities held individually, including real estate investment trusts, rights, and warrants, are primarily traded on exchanges that contain only actively traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges. The equity securities that are held directly by the trust funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level 1. Certain equity securities have been categorized as Level 2 because they are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities. Certain private placement equity securities are categorized as Level 3 because they are not publicly traded and are priced using significant unobservable inputs.\nEquity commingled funds and mutual funds are maintained by investment companies, and fund investments are held in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For equity commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets on the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments can typically be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions.\nFixed income.\n For fixed income securities, which consist primarily of corporate debt securities, U.S. government securities, foreign government securities, municipal bonds, asset and mortgage-backed securities, commingled funds, mutual funds, and derivative instruments, the trustees obtain multiple prices from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class, or issue for each security. With respect to individually held fixed income securities, the trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine that another price source is preferable. We have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, we selectively corroborate the fair values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain private placement fixed income securities have been categorized as Level 3 because they are priced using certain significant unobservable inputs and are typically illiquid. The remaining fixed income securities, including certain other fixed income investments, are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized as Level 2. This includes equity investments sold short during the period, which represent liabilities.\nOther fixed income investments primarily consist of fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds, which are maintained by investment companies and hold fund investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments typically can be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions.\nDerivative instruments.\n These instruments, consisting primarily of futures and swaps to manage risk, are recorded at fair value. Over-the-counter derivatives are valued daily, based on quoted prices in active markets and trade in open markets, and have been categorized as Level 1. Derivative instruments other than over-the-counter derivatives are valued based on external price data of comparable securities and have been categorized as Level 2.\nPrivate credit.\n Private credit investments primarily consist of investments in private debt strategies. These investments are generally less liquid assets with an underlying term of 3 to 5 years and are intended to be held to maturity. The fair value of these investments is determined by the fund manager or administrator using a combination of valuation models including cost models, market models, and income models and typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan. Private credit investments held directly by us are categorized as Level 3 because they are based largely on inputs that are unobservable and utilize complex valuation models. \n147\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFor certain private credit funds, the fair value is determined using a combination of valuation models including cost models, market models, and income models and typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan. These investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy because their fair value is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient.\nPrivate equity.\n These investments include those in limited partnerships that invest in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange such as leveraged buyouts, growth capital, venture capital, distressed investments, and investments in natural resources. These investments typically cannot be redeemed and are generally liquidated over a period of 8 to 10 years from the initial investment date, which is based on our understanding of the investment funds. Private equity valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include unobservable inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows, and market-based comparable data. These valuation inputs are unobservable. The fair value of private equity investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nReal assets.\n These investments are funds with a direct investment in pools of real estate properties or infrastructure assets. These funds are reported by the fund manager and are generally based on independent appraisals of the underlying investments from sources with professional qualifications, typically using a combination of market-based comparable data and discounted cash flows. These valuation inputs are unobservable. Certain real asset investments cannot be redeemed and are generally liquidated over a period of 8 to 25 years from the initial investment date, which is based on our understanding of the investment funds. The remaining liquid real asset investments are generally redeemable from the investment vehicle quarterly, with 30 to 90 days of notice. The fair value of real asset investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. \nWe evaluated our NDT portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2024. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual fund. As of December 31, 2024, there were no significant concentrations (generally defined as greater than 10 percent) of risk in the NDT assets. \nSee Note 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information on the NDT fund investments. \nRabbi Trust Investments.  \nThe Rabbi trusts were established to hold assets related to deferred compensation plans existing for certain active and retired members of executive management and directors. The Rabbi trusts' assets are included in investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and consist primarily of money market funds, mutual funds, and life insurance policies. Money market funds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and have been categorized as Level 1 given the clear observability of the prices. The life insurance policies are valued using the cash surrender value of the policies, net of loans against those policies, which is provided by a third-party. Certain life insurance policies, which consist primarily of mutual funds that are priced based on observable market data, have been categorized as Level 2 because the life insurance policies can be liquidated at the reporting date for the value of the underlying assets.\nDeferred Compensation Obligations.  \nOur deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into a notional investment account. We include such plans in other current and noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of our deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants’ notional investment accounts. The underlying notional investments are comprised primarily of equities, mutual funds, commingled funds, and fixed income securities which are based on directly and indirectly observable market prices. Since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active market, they are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe value of certain employment agreement obligations (which are included with the Deferred compensation obligation in the table above) are based on a known and certain stream of payments to be made over time and are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nInvestments in Equities.\n \nWe hold certain investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values in addition to those held within the NDT funds. These equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level 1.\n148\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nDeferred Purchase Price Consideration.  \nWe had DPP consideration for the sale of certain receivables of retail electricity. This amount was valued based on the sales price of the receivables net of allowance for credit losses (see Note 1 — Basis of Presentation\n \nfor additional details on our policy for credit losses).  Since the DPP consideration was based on the sales price of the receivables, it was categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 7 — Accounts Receivable for additional information on the sale of certain customer accounts receivables.\nMark-to-Market Derivatives.\n  Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain derivatives’ pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers, over-the-counter, or exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask, mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that we believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads, and contract duration. The remainder of derivative contracts are valued using the Black model, an industry standard option valuation model. The Black model considers inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, including assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness, and credit spread. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps, and options, model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. Our derivatives are predominantly at liquid trading points. For derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. These valuations may include an estimated basis adjustment from an illiquid trading point to a liquid trading point for which active price quotations are available. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3.\nFor valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is categorized in Level 3. This includes derivatives valued using indicative price quotations whose contract tenure extends into unobservable periods. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility, and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. We consider credit and non-performance risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Level 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data, in our assessment of credit and non-performance risk by counterparty. Due to master netting agreements and collateral posting requirements, the impacts of credit and non-performance risk were not material to the consolidated financial statements.\nDisclosed below is detail surrounding our significant Level 3 valuations. The calculated fair value includes marketability discounts for margining provisions and other attributes. The Level 3 balance generally consists of forward sales and purchases of power and natural gas and certain transmission congestion contracts. We utilize various inputs and factors including market data and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. The inputs and factors include forward commodity prices, commodity price volatility, contractual volumes, delivery location, interest rates, credit quality of counterparties, and credit enhancements. \nFor commodity derivatives, the primary input to the valuation models is the forward commodity price curve for each instrument. All locations are reviewed and verified by risk management considering published exchange transaction prices, executed bilateral transactions, broker quotes, and other observable or public data sources. The relevant forward commodity curve used to value each of the derivatives depends on a number of factors, including commodity type, delivery location, and delivery period. Price volatility varies by commodity and location. When appropriate, we discount future cash flows using risk-free interest rates with adjustments to reflect the credit quality of each counterparty for assets and our own credit quality for liabilities. The level of observability of a forward commodity price varies generally due to the delivery location and delivery period. Certain delivery locations including PJM West Hub (for power) and Henry Hub (for natural gas) are more liquid and prices are observable for up to three years in the future. The observability period of volatility is generally shorter than the underlying power curve used in option valuations. The forward curve for a less liquid location is estimated by using the forward curve from the liquid location and applying a spread to represent the cost to transport the commodity to the delivery location. This spread does not typically represent a majority of the instrument’s market price. As a result, the change in fair value is closely tied to liquid market movements and not a change in the applied spread. The change in fair value associated with a change in the spread is generally immaterial. An \n149\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 — Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\naverage spread calculated across all Level 3 power and gas delivery locations is approximately $\n48.71\n and $\n3.68\n for power and natural gas, respectively as of December 31, 2024. Many of the commodity derivatives are short term in nature and thus a majority of the fair value may be based on observable inputs even though the contract as a whole must be classified as Level 3. \nSee Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information on mark-to-market derivatives.\nThe following table presents the significant inputs to the forward curve used to value these positions:\nType of trade\nFair Value as of December 31, 2024\nFair Value as of December 31, 2023\nValuation Technique\nUnobservable Input\n2024 Range & Arithmetic Average\n2023 Range & Arithmetic Average\nMark-to-market derivatives—Economic hedges\n(a)(b)\n$\n(\n137\n)\n$\n407\n \nDiscounted Cash Flow\nForward power price\n$\n2.57\n-\n$\n140\n$\n49\n$\n9.64\n-\n$\n216\n$\n48\nForward gas price\n$\n2.09\n-\n$\n15\n$\n3.68\n$\n1.20\n-\n$\n14\n$\n3.09\nOption Model\nVolatility percentage\n23\n%\n-\n141\n%\n57\n%\n23\n%\n-\n200\n%\n87\n%\n__________\n(a)\nThe valuation techniques, unobservable inputs, ranges, and arithmetic averages are the same for the asset and liability positions.\n(b)\nThe fair values do not include cash collateral posted (received) on Level 3 positions of $\n136\n million and $\n462\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe inputs listed above, which are as of the balance sheet date, would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our commodity derivatives are forward commodity prices and for options is price volatility. Increases (decreases) in the forward commodity price in isolation would result in significantly higher (lower) fair values for long positions (contracts that give us the obligation or option to purchase a commodity), with offsetting impacts to short positions (contracts that give us the obligation or right to sell a commodity). Increases (decreases) in volatility would increase (decrease) the value for the holder of the option (writer of the option). Generally, a change in the estimate of forward commodity prices is unrelated to a change in the estimate of volatility of prices. An increase to the heat rate or renewable factors would increase the fair value accordingly. Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.\n18.    \nCommitments and Contingencies\nCommercial Commitments.  \nCommercial commitments as of December 31, 2024, representing commitments potentially triggered by future events, were as follows:\nExpiration within\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030 and beyond\nTotal\nLetters of credit\n$\n1,924\n \n$\n127\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n120\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2,173\n \nSurety bonds\n(a)\n526\n \n1\n \n—\n \n214\n \n—\n \n—\n \n741\n \nTotal commercial commitments \n$\n2,450\n \n$\n128\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n334\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2,914\n \n__________\n(a)\nSurety bonds — Guarantees issued related to contract and commercial agreements, excluding bid bonds.\nNuclear Insurance \nWe are subject to liability, property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at any of our nuclear stations. Our financial exposure to these risks is mitigated through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions.\nThe Price-Anderson Act was enacted to ensure the availability of funds for public liability claims arising from an incident at any of the U.S. licensed nuclear facilities and to limit the liability of nuclear reactor owners for such \n150\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\nclaims from any single incident. As of December 31, 2024, the current liability limit per incident is $\n16.3\n billion and is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and changes in the number of licensed reactors at least once every five years with the last adjustment effective January 1, 2024. In accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, we maintain financial protection at levels equal to the amount of liability insurance available from private sources through the purchase of private nuclear energy liability insurance for public liability claims that could arise in the event of an incident. Effective January 1, 2024, the required amount of nuclear energy liability insurance purchased is $\n500\n million for each operating site. Claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool, as required by the Price Anderson-Act, which could provide up to approximately an additional $\n15.8\n billion per incident at any U.S. nuclear power reactor in funds available for public liability claims. Participation in this secondary financial protection pool requires the operator of each reactor to fund its proportionate share of costs for any single incident at any U.S. nuclear power reactor that exceeds the primary layer of financial protection. Our share of this secondary layer would be approximately $\n3.5\n billion, based on our ownership interest in the insured nuclear reactors, however, any amounts payable under this secondary layer would be capped at $\n520\n million per incident within one calendar year.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay public liability claims exceeding the $\n16.3\n billion limit for a single incident.\nWe are required by the NRC to maintain minimal levels of property insurance that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the NRC that we possess an equivalent amount of protection covering the licensee's obligation, in the event of an accident at the licensee's reactor, to stabilize and decontaminate the reactor and the reactor station site at which the reactor experiencing the accident is located. The insurance maintained for each facility is currently provided through insurance policies purchased from NEIL, an industry mutual insurance company of which we are a member. Currently, NRC requires that we maintain a minimum coverage limit for each reactor site of $\n1.06\n billion, and we currently have coverage of $\n1.5\n billion for each site.\nNEIL may declare distributions to its members as a result of favorable operating experience. In recent years, NEIL has made distributions to its members. Our portion of the annual distribution declared by NEIL is estimated to be $\n43\n million for 2024, and was $\n59\n million and $\n30\n million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The distributions were recorded as a reduction to Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nPremiums paid to NEIL by its members are also subject to a potential assessment for adverse loss experience in the form of a retrospective premium obligation. NEIL has never assessed this retrospective premium since its formation in 1973, and we cannot predict the level of future assessments, if any. The current maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for our interests is approximately $\n268\n million. NEIL requires its members to maintain an investment grade credit rating or to ensure collectability of their annual retrospective premium obligation by providing a financial guarantee, letter of credit, deposit premium, or some other means of assurance.\nNEIL provides “all risk” property damage, decontamination, and premature decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. If the decision is made to decommission the facility, a portion of the insurance proceeds will be allocated to a fund, which we are required by the NRC to maintain, to provide for decommissioning the facility. In the event of an insured loss, we are unable to predict the timing of the availability of insurance proceeds to us and the amount of such proceeds that would be available. In the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause accidental property damage within a twelve-month period from the first accidental property damage under one or more policies for all insured plants, the maximum recovery by us will be an aggregate of $\n3.2\n billion plus such additional amounts as the insurer may recover for all such losses from reinsurance, indemnity and any other source, applicable to such losses.\nFor our insured losses, we are self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recoverable from insurers or the nuclear industry, could also be borne by us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n151\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\nSpent Nuclear Fuel Obligation \nUnder the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), the DOE is responsible for the development of a geologic repository for and the disposal of SNF and high-level radioactive waste. As required by the NWPA, we are a party to contracts with the DOE (Standard Contracts) to provide for disposal of SNF from our nuclear generating stations. In accordance with the NWPA and the Standard Contracts, we had previously paid the DOE one mill ($0.001) per kWh of net nuclear generation for the cost of SNF disposal. The DOE reduced the SNF disposal fee to zero in May 2014. Until a new fee structure is in effect, we will not accrue any further costs related to SNF disposal fees. This fee may be adjusted prospectively to ensure full cost recovery.\nWe currently assume the DOE will begin accepting SNF in 2040 and use that date for purposes of estimating the nuclear decommissioning AROs. The SNF acceptance date assumption is based on management’s estimate of the amount of time required for DOE to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure for long-term SNF storage.\nThe NWPA and the Standard Contracts required the DOE to begin taking possession of SNF generated by nuclear generating units no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE, however, failed to meet that deadline and its performance has been, and is expected to remain, delayed. In August 2004, we and the DOJ, in close consultation with the DOE, reached a settlement under which the government agreed to reimburse us, subject to certain damage limitations based on the extent of the government’s breach, for costs associated with storage of SNF at our nuclear stations pending the DOE’s fulfillment of its obligations. That settlement agreement does not expire until all SNF has been collected from the sites that it covers. Calvert Cliffs, Ginna, NMP, Fitzpatrick, and STP each have separate settlement agreements in place with the DOE which were extended during 2023 to provide for the reimbursement of SNF storage costs through December 31, 2025. We and the DOE have the option to extend those settlements every three years upon mutual consent.\nUnder the settlement agreements, we received total cumulative cash reimbursements of $\n2,099\n million through December 31, 2024 for costs incurred. After considering the amounts due to co-owners of certain nuclear stations and to the current owner of Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, we received net cumulative cash reimbursements of $\n1,829\n million. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of SNF storage costs for which reimbursement has been or will be requested from the DOE under the DOE settlement agreements is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDOE receivable - current\n(a)\n$\n124\n \n$\n229\n \nDOE receivable - noncurrent\n(b)\n42\n \n40\n \nAmounts owed to co-owners\n(c)\n(\n40\n)\n(\n23\n)\n__________\n(a)\nRecorded in Other accounts receivable.\n(b)\nRecorded in Other deferred debits and other assets.\n(c)\nRecorde\nd primarily in \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses and \nOther accounts receivable. Represents amounts owed to the co-owners of Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, and NMP Unit 2 generating facilitie\ns\n.\nThe Standard Contracts with the DOE also required the payment to the DOE of a one-time fee applicable to nuclear plants that generated SNF prior to April 7, 1983. \nThe below table outlines the SNF liability recorded as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nFormer ComEd units\n(a)\n$\n1,219\n \n$\n1,158\n \nFitzpatrick\n(b)\n147\n \n138\n \nTotal SNF Obligation\n$\n1,366\n \n$\n1,296\n \n__________\n(a)\nComEd previously elected to defer payment of the one-time fee of $\n277\n million for its units that began operations before April 7, 1983, with interest to the date of payment, until just prior to the first delivery of SNF to the DOE. The unfunded liabilities for SNF disposal costs, including the one-time fee, were transferred to us as part of Exelon’s 2001 corporate restructuring. See Note 10 — Asset Retirement Obligations for additional detail on Zion Station’s SNF obligation which is included in the table above.   \n(b)\nA prior owner of FitzPatrick elected to defer payment of the one-time fee of $\n34\n million, with interest to the date of payment, for the FitzPatrick unit. As part of the FitzPatrick acquisition on March 31, 2017, we assumed a SNF liability for \n152\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\nthe DOE one-time fee obligation with interest related to FitzPatrick along with an offsetting asset, included in Other deferred debits and other assets, for the contractual right to reimbursement from NYPA, a prior owner of FitzPatrick, for amounts paid for the FitzPatrick DOE one-time fee obligation.\nInterest for our SNF liabilities accrues at the 13-week Treasury Rate. The 13-week Treasury Rate in effect for calculation of the interest accrual at December 31, 2024 was \n4.553\n% for the deferred amount transferred from ComEd and \n4.615\n% for the deferred FitzPatrick amount.\nThe following table summarizes sites for which we do not have an outstanding SNF Obligation:\nDescription\nSites\nFees have been paid or began operations after April 7, 1983\nFormer PECO units, Braidwood, Byron, Calvert Cliffs, Clinton, LaSalle Unit 2, NMP Unit 2, and STP\nOutstanding SNF Obligation remains with former owners\nNMP Unit 1, Ginna, and Crane\nEnvironmental Remediation Matters\nGeneral.\n \nOur operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial expenditures to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, we are generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by us. We own or lease several real estate parcels, including parcels on which our operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. In addition, we are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. Unless otherwise disclosed, we cannot reasonably estimate whether we will incur significant liabilities for additional investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by us, environmental agencies or others. Additional costs could have a material, unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had accrued undiscounted amounts for environmental liabilities of $\n60\n million and $\n61\n million, respectively, in Accounts payable and accrued expenses and $\n169\n million and $\n88\n million, respectively, in Other deferred credits and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCotter Corporation.  \nThe EPA has advised Cotter Corporation (N.S.L.) (Cotter), a former ComEd subsidiary, that it is potentially liable in connection with radiological contamination at two sites in Missouri. In 2000, ComEd sold Cotter to an unaffiliated third-party. As part of the sale, ComEd agreed to indemnify Cotter for any liability arising from these two Missouri superfund sites, West Lake Landfill and Latty Avenue. In connection with Exelon’s 2001 corporate restructuring, this responsibility to indemnify Cotter was transferred to us, and ultimately retained by us per the terms of our separation from Exelon. Refer to Note 1 — Basis of Presentation for additional information on the separation.\nWest Lake Landfill.\n Including Cotter, there are \nthree\n PRPs currently participating in the West Lake Landfill remediation proceeding.\nWest Lake Landfill; Operable Unit 1 (OU1); Landfill Remediation. \nIn September 2018, the EPA issued its Record of Decision Amendment (RODA) for the selection of a final remedy that requires partial excavation of the radiological materials and capping the landfill. The EPA and the PRPs have entered into a Consent Agreement to perform the Remedial Design, which is expected to be completed in 2025. In March 2019, the PRPs received Special Notice Letters from the EPA to perform the Remedial Action work. The total estimated cost of the remedy, considering the current EPA technical requirements, is approximately $\n530\n million, including cost escalation on an undiscounted basis. \nWest Lake Landfill; Operable Unit 3 (OU3); Groundwater Study. \nIn September 2018, the \nthree\n identified PRPs, including Cotter, signed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for the performance by the PRPs of the groundwater Remedial Investigation Feasibility Study (RI/FS). The purpose of this RI/FS is to define the nature and extent of any groundwater contamination from the West Lake Landfill site and evaluate remedial alternatives. We estimate the undiscounted cost for the groundwater RI/FS to be approximately $\n60\n million. At this time we cannot predict the likelihood, or the extent to which remediation activities, if any, may be \n153\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\nrequired and therefore cannot estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for response costs beyond those associated with the RI/FS component. \nWe determined a loss associated with the EPA's partial excavation and landfill cover remedy and the groundwater RI/FS is probable and have recorded a liability for each, both of which are included in the total amount as discussed above, that reflects management’s best estimate of Cotter’s allocable share of the cost among the PRPs. Given the joint and several nature of these two liabilities, the amount of our ultimate liability will depend on the actual costs incurred to implement the required remedy at OU1 and the required study at OU3, as well as on the nature and terms of any cost-sharing arrangements with the final group of PRPs. It is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost and Cotter's associated allocable share could differ significantly once these uncertainties are resolved, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nLatty Avenue and Vicinity Properties\n. In August 2011, Cotter was notified by the DOJ that Cotter is considered a PRP with respect to the government’s clean-up costs for contamination attributable to low-level radioactive residues at a former storage and reprocessing facility named Latty Avenue near St. Louis, Missouri. \nLatty Avenue was investigated and remediated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to funding under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. The PRPs reached a settlement of this matter and the government filed a motion for entry of a Consent Decree, which was entered by the Court on January 24, 2025. Payment of $\n50\n million plus statutory interest was made on January 30, 2025. The consent decree settles past and future responses costs incurred by the United States Army Corp of Engineers and DOE for their response actions conducted in connection with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances, including radioactive substances at Latty Avenue and certain additional adjacent properties. The settlement amount for this matter is included in the total amount of environmental liabilities recognized as of December 31, 2024, referenced previously. \nLitigation \nGeneral.  \nWe are involved in various other litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. We maintain accruals for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss, particularly where (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss.\nImpacts of the February 2021 Extreme Cold Weather Event and Texas-based Generating Assets Outages. \nBeginning on February 15, 2021, our Texas-based generating assets within the ERCOT market, specifically Colorado Bend II, Wolf Hollow II, and Handley, experienced outages as a result of extreme cold weather conditions. \nVarious lawsuits have been filed against us since the February 2021 event and outages. In March 2021, we, along with more than 150 power generators and transmission and distribution companies, were sued by approximately 160 individually named plaintiffs, purportedly on behalf of all Texans who allegedly suffered loss of life or sustained personal injury, property damage, or other losses as a result of the weather events. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to properly prepare for the cold weather and failed to properly conduct their operations, seeking compensatory as well as punitive damages. Thereafter, numerous other plaintiffs filed multiple lawsuits against more than 300 defendants, including us, involving similar allegations of liability and claims of personal injury and property damage all arising out of the February weather events. These additional lawsuits allege wrongful death, property damage, or other losses. Co-defendants in these lawsuits include ERCOT, transmission and distribution utilities and other generators. \nIn December 2021, approximately 130 insurance companies which insured Texas homeowners and businesses filed a subrogation lawsuit against multiple defendants alleging that defendants were at fault for the energy failure that resulted from the winter storm, causing significant property damage to the insureds. Subsequently, several hundred other insurance companies filed similar claims. All of these cases were combined in a Multi-District-Litigation (MDL) pending in Texas state court, which established a bellwether process to consider initial motions to dismiss by the different industry groups of defendants. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended \n154\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 — Commitments and Contingencies\ncomplaints in five bellwether cases in July 2022. In February 2023, the court granted the motions to dismiss pertaining to us in part and denied them in part, leaving the plaintiffs' negligence and nuisance claims to proceed. Since the motions to dismiss were partially denied, thousands of new claimants, many in multiple mass tort actions, filed lawsuits in various Texas state courts naming us, among hundreds of other defendants. The majority of these cases were transferred to the MDL. The MDL involves over 200 cases brought by approximately 30,000 plaintiffs, including more than 1,300 insurance companies, and we are defendants in the majority of them. We are also named in an alleged class action that seeks to assert claims on behalf of over 4.1 million Texans within ERCOT who lost power during Winter Storm Uri.\nIn December 2023, the Court of Appeals for the First District of Texas granted the power generator defendants' Petition for a Writ of Mandamus in the five bellwether cases and ordered the MDL court to dismiss the remaining claims against the power generator defendants, including our entities. The motions to dismiss in the five bellwether cases are expected to be applied to all the claims against the power generator defendants in the MDL. In January 2024, plaintiffs filed motions for en banc reconsideration of the order with the full court of appeals in all five bellwether cases. In November 2024, the court denied plaintiffs' motions. In January 2025, plaintiffs petitioned the Supreme Court of Texas for mandamus review, requesting that the court reinstate the MDL court's denial of the generator defendants' motions to dismiss and thereby permit plaintiffs' claims to proceed. \nIn addition to the cases pending in the MDL in Texas state court, in January 2025, the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma filed a lawsuit in state court against us, along with 10 other defendants, alleging antitrust and consumer protection act violations as well as unjust enrichment in connection with the sale, transport and marketing of natural gas to state agencies, municipalities and the people of the state of Oklahoma during the extreme cold weather event.  The Attorney General seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\nWe dispute liability and deny that we are responsible for any of plaintiffs’ alleged claims and are vigorously contesting them. No loss contingencies have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements with respect to these matters, nor can we currently estimate a range of loss. It is reasonably possible, however, that resolution of these matters could have a material, unfavorable impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAsbestos Personal Injury Claims.  \nWe maintain a reserve for claims associated with asbestos-related personal injury actions at certain facilities that are currently owned by us or were previously owned by ComEd, PECO, or BGE. The estimated liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis and exclude the estimated legal costs associated with handling these matters, which could be material.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded estimated liabilities of approximately $\n125\n million and $\n131\n million, respectively, in total for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $\n14\n million of this amount related to \n203\n open claims presented to us, while the remaining $\n111\n million is for estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims anticipated to arise through 2055, based on actuarial assumptions and analyses, which are updated on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, we monitor actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments and evaluate whether adjustments to the estimated liabilities are necessary.\n19.    \nShareholders' Equity\nShare Repurchase Program (CEG Parent)\nSince 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $\n3\n billion of the Company's outstanding common stock. Share repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, provided that the amounts spent do not exceed what is authorized. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and cancelled. The program does not obligate us to acquire a minimum number of shares during any period and our repurchase of CEG's common stock may be limited, suspended, or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. No other repurchase plans or programs have been authorized. As of December 31, 2024, there was $\n991\n million of remaining authority to repurchase shares of the Company's outstanding common stock.\nDuring 2024 and 2023, we repurchased from the open market approximately \n1.2\n million and \n10.6\n million shares, respectively, of our common stock for a total cost, inclusive of taxes and transaction costs, of $\n150\n million and $\n1\n billion, respectively. \n155\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 — Shareholders' Equity\nIn 2024, we entered into ASR agreements with financial institutions to initiate share repurchases of our common stock. Under the ASR agreements, we paid a specified amount to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of shares of common stock, which resulted in an immediate reduction in the number of our shares outstanding. Based on the terms of the ASR agreements below, we received an initial share delivery based on \n80\n% of the ASR agreements' cost. Upon settlement of the ASR agreements, the financial institution delivers additional incremental shares. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR agreement based on the average of the daily volume weighted average share price, less a discount.\nThe following table summarizes each ASR agreement for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n(in millions, except average price paid per share)\nASR Agreement Initiation\nTotal Cost\nInitial Shares Received\nASR Agreement Settlement\nAdditional Shares Received\n(a)\nTotal Number of Shares Purchased\nAverage Price Paid per Share\nMarch 2024\n$\n354\n \n1.7\n \nMay 2024\n0.2\n \n1.9\n \n$\n182.65\n \nMay 2024\n$\n505\n \n1.8\n \nJuly 2024\n0.6\n \n2.4\n \n$\n211.40\n \n__________\n(a)\nThe \n0.6\n million additional shares received and settled in July 2024 were rounded for footing.\nChanges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (All Registrants)\nThe following tables present changes in AOCI, net of tax, by component:\nGains (losses) on Cash Flow Hedges\nPension and OPEB Plan Items\n(a)\nForeign Currency Items\nTotal\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n23\n)\n$\n(\n31\n)\nSeparation-related adjustments\n—\n \n(\n2,006\n)\n—\n \n(\n2,006\n)\nOCI before reclassifications\n(\n1\n)\n186\n \n(\n3\n)\n182\n \nAmounts reclassified from AOCI\n—\n \n95\n \n—\n \n95\n \nNet current-period OCI\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1,725\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n1,729\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n(\n9\n)\n$\n(\n1,725\n)\n$\n(\n26\n)\n$\n(\n1,760\n)\nOCI before reclassifications\n(\n2\n)\n(\n453\n)\n2\n \n(\n453\n)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI\n1\n \n21\n \n—\n \n22\n \nNet current-period OCI\n(\n1\n)\n(\n432\n)\n2\n \n(\n431\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n(\n10\n)\n$\n(\n2,157\n)\n$\n(\n24\n)\n$\n(\n2,191\n)\nOCI before reclassifications\n—\n \n(\n176\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n186\n)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI\n4\n \n71\n \n—\n \n75\n \nNet current-period OCI\n4\n \n(\n105\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n111\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n(\n6\n)\n$\n(\n2,262\n)\n$\n(\n34\n)\n$\n(\n2,302\n)\n__________\n(a)\nAOCI amounts are included in the computation of net periodic pension and OPEB cost.

Our LTIP authorized \n20,000,000\n shares of common stock for these awards. The existing, unvested cash and stock-based awards issued through the Exelon LTIP were modified in connection with the separation to align with our performance metrics and maintain an equivalent value immediately before and after separation. The impact of this modification was not material to our stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOur employees were granted stock-based awards through the Exelon LTIP prior to separation, which primarily included performance share awards and restricted stock units. We also granted cash awards.\nThe following table presents the stock-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The information does not include expenses related to the cash awards as they are not considered stock-based compensation plans under the applicable authoritative guidance:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal stock-based compensation expense included in operating and maintenance expense\n$\n332\n \n$\n178\n \n$\n116\n \nIncome tax benefit\n(\n85\n)\n(\n45\n)\n(\n29\n)\nTotal after-tax stock-based compensation expense\n$\n247\n \n$\n133\n \n$\n87\n \nWe receive a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award on the distribution date for performance share awards and restricted stock units. The tax deduction related to performance share awards and restricted stock units was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, we recognize the tax benefit related to compensation costs. For performance share awards and restricted stock units, our realized tax benefit when distributed was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nPerformance Share Awards\nPerformance share awards are granted under the LTIP. The performance share awards are typically settled \n50\n% in common stock and \n50\n% in cash at the end of the \nthree-year\n performance period, subject to certain ownership thresholds that, if met, may result in cash settlement of the entire award.\nThe common stock portion of the performance share awards is considered an equity award and is valued based on our stock price on the grant date. The cash portion of the performance share awards is considered a liability award which is remeasured each reporting period based on the current stock price. As the value of the common stock and cash portions of the awards are based on the stock price during the performance period, coupled with changes in the total expected payout of the award, the compensation costs are subject to volatility until payment is made.\nFor nonretirement-eligible employees, performance share awards are recognized over the vesting period of \nthree years\n using the straight-line method. For performance share awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, the value of the performance shares is recognized ratably over the vesting period, which is the year of grant. We process forfeitures as they occur for employees who do not complete the requisite service period.\n157\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 20 — Stock-Based Compensation Plans\nThe following table summarizes our unvested performance share awards activity:\nShares\nWeighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (per share)\nUnvested at December 31, 2023\n836,325\n \n$\n61.47\n \nGranted\n257,792\n \n127.03\n \nChange in performance\n116,090\n \n130.06\n \nForfeited\n(\n11,526\n)\n96.27\n \nUndistributed vested awards\n(a)\n(\n663,055\n)\n207.72\n \nUnvested at December 31, 2024\n535,626\n \n$\n99.06\n \n__________\n(a)\nRepresents performance share awards that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2024 and 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average grant date fair value and the total fair value of performance share awards vested:\nDecember 31, 2024\n(a)\nDecember 31, 2023\n(a)\nWeighted average grant date fair value (per share)\n$\n127.03\n \n$\n83.26\n \nTotal fair value of performance shares vested\n138\n \n76\n \n__________\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and \n2023\n, \n$\n50\n million\n and $\n39\n million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested performance shares are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of \n1.5\n years and \n1.6\n years, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units are granted under the LTIP with the majority being settled in a specific number of shares of common stock after the service condition has been met. The corresponding cost is measured based on the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit issued. \nThe value of the restricted stock units is expensed over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for restricted stock units is generally \nthree\n to \nfive years\n. However, certain restricted stock unit awards become fully vested upon the employee reaching retirement eligibility. The value of the restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized ratably over the vesting period, which is the year of grant.

We have a \n51\n% equity ownership in CRP. See additional discussion below.\nSimilar structure to a limited partnership and the limited partners do not have kick-out rights with respect to the general partner.\nWe conduct the operational activities.\nBluestem Wind Energy Holdings, LLC - A Tax Equity structure which is consolidated by CRP.\nSimilar structure to a limited partnership and the limited partners do not have kick-out rights with respect to the general partner.\nWe conduct the operational activities.\nAntelope Valley - A solar generating facility, which is \n100\n% owned by us. Antelope Valley sells all of its output to PG&E through a PPA.\nThe PPA contract absorbs variability through a performance guarantee.\nWe conduct all activities.\nNER - A bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity which is \n100\n% owned by us, which purchases certain of our customer accounts receivable arising from the sale of retail electricity.\nNER’s assets will be available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of the creditors of NER. Refer to Note 7 —Accounts Receivable for additional information on the sale of receivables. \nEquity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations.\nWe conduct all activities.\nCRP\n - CRP is a collection of wind and solar project entities and some of these project entities are VIEs that are consolidated by CRP. While we or CRP own \n100\n% of the solar entities and \n100\n% of the majority of the wind entities, it has been determined that the wholly owned solar and wind entities are VIEs because the entities' customers absorb price variability from the entities through fixed price power and/or REC purchase agreements. Additionally, for the wind entities that have minority interests, it has been determined that these entities are VIEs because the governance rights of some investors are not proportional to their financial rights. We are the primary beneficiary of these solar and wind entities that qualify as VIEs because we control operations and direct all activities of the facilities. There is limited recourse to us related to certain solar and wind entities.\nIn 2017, our interests in CRP were contributed to and are pledged for the CR nonrecourse debt project financing structure. Refer to Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nOur variable interests in unconsolidated VIEs generally include equity investments and energy purchase and sale contracts. For the equity investments, the carrying amount of the investments is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Investments. For the energy purchase and sale contracts (commercial agreements), the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to our involvement with the VIEs are predominantly related to working capital accounts and generally represent the amounts owed by, or owed to us for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycles under the commercial agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had significant unconsolidated variable interests in several VIEs for which we were not the primary beneficiary. These interests include certain equity method investments and certain commercial agreements.\n160\nTable of Contents\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nNote 21 — Variable Interest Entities\nThe following table presents summary information about our significant unconsolidated VIE entities:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCommercial Agreement VIEs\nEquity Investment VIEs\nTotal\nCommercial Agreement VIEs\nEquity Investment VIEs\nTotal\nTotal assets\n(a)\n$\n617\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n617\n \n$\n704\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n704\n \nTotal liabilities\n(a)\n42\n \n—\n \n42\n \n77\n \n—\n \n77\n \nOther ownership interests in VIE\n(a)\n575\n \n—\n \n575\n \n627\n \n—\n \n627\n \n__________\n(a)\nThese items represent amounts on the unconsolidated VIE balance sheets, not in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that (a) information relating to our consolidated subsidiaries, is accumulated and made known to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, by other employees as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (b) this information is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people.\n165\nTable of Contents\nAccordingly, as of December 31, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe continually strive to improve our disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of our financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of our internal control over financial reporting. \nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is required to assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. As a result of that assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of December 31, 2024 and, therefore, concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in ITEM 8.
