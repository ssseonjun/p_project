The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n, \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n, and other information contained in this report. The forward-looking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve assumptions, risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including statements regarding our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, and financial performance. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” and those set forth in",
    "item1a": "Item 1A: “\nRisk Factors\n” of this report. Additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the Risk Management and Capital discussion of this report, as well as the “\nRegulatory Matters\n” section included in Item 1: Business of this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates \nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 - “\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference into this MD&A, describes the significant accounting policies we used in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAn accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL at December 31, 2024 represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments. Management estimates the ACL by projecting probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default, conditional on economic parameters, for the remaining contractual term. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. We utilize statistically-based models that employ assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of our loan portfolio. As part of our model risk oversight, we perform ongoing monitoring of model performance to assess modeling approaches and identify potential model enhancements, which may result in updates to our statistically based models from time-to-time.\nOne of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts. Key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted unemployment rates and GDP. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses, which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next.\nGiven the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. As a result, management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse, and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate.\n88\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nTo illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario contemplates elevated interest rates weakening credit-sensitive consumer spending and confidence, growing concerns about the impact of potential tariffs reducing consumer and business sentiment, and deepening fiscal disputes in Congress causing further sentiment decline. Concerns about the banking industry also impact consumer confidence, causing banks to tighten lending standards. Increased geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan briefly impact the supply chain for semiconductors and the threat of a wider conflict causes consumer confidence to fall. Additionally, the Russian invasion of Ukraine lasts longer than in the baseline scenario and concerns increase around the current conflict in the Middle East leading to a broader war in the region. The combination of still elevated interest rates, political tensions, and tightening lending standards cause the stock market to fall. The economy falls into a recession in the first quarter of 2025. In response to the recession, the Federal Reserve cuts the federal funds rate more aggressively with rates significantly below the baseline forecast starting in the first quarter of 2025. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate increases from baseline levels and remains elevated for a prolonged period. The rate in this adverse scenario is projected at 8.2% at the end of 2025, approximately 4.1% higher than the baseline scenario projection.\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our ACL at December 31, 2024, management calculated the difference between our quantitative ACL and this 100% adverse scenario. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of approximately $0.8 billion at December 31, 2024.\nThe resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following:\n•\nManagement uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process;\n•\nThe highly uncertain economic environment; \n•\nThe difficulty in predicting the inter-relationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios; and\n•\nThe sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework.\nWe regularly review our ACL for appropriateness by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. In doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. Large loan exposures may be addressed through a portfolio heterogeneity reserve. We also consider how significant changes in underwriting policies and procedures could impact the ACL, including consideration of material changes in portfolio growth rates or credit terms. Any changes to management and staffing that could impact lending, collections, or other relevant departments that could increase risk within the allowance process are also contemplated. Observed changes in the quality of the credit review process identified by the second and third line reviews are also given appropriate consideration.\nThere is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or our markets such as geopolitical instability, or risks of elevated interest rates for longer including a near-term recession, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the geopolitical instability and risks of elevated interest rates for longer will continue to negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, liquidity, and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n89\nTable of \nContents\nGoodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting requires that assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets and liabilities often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. This typically results in goodwill, the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value, which is subject to impairment testing at least annually. \nManagement reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value.\nBased on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of October 1, 2024, it was determined that the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its respective carrying value as of October 1, 2024; therefore, goodwill is considered not impaired. Huntington additionally performs sensitivity analyses around discount rate assumptions utilized in order to assess the reasonableness of the rates, and the resulting estimated fair values. As of October 1, 2024, a 100 basis point increase in discount rates would reduce estimated entity level fair value by approximately $3 billion and would not result in any goodwill impairment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments\nNote 2 - “\nAccounting Standards Update\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2024 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this MD&A and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInformation required by this item is set forth under the heading of “\nMarket Risk\n” in Item 7: MD&A, which is incorporated by reference into this item.\nItem 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nInformation required by this item is set forth in the \nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n (PCAOB ID \n238\n), \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n and \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n, which is incorporated by reference into this item. \n90\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT’S EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Management of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (Huntington or the Company) is responsible for the financial information and representations contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and other sections of this report. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In all material respects, they reflect the substance of transactions that should be included based on informed judgments, estimates, and currently available information. Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls, which includes the careful selection and training of qualified personnel, appropriate segregation of responsibilities, communication of written policies and procedures, and a broad program of internal audits. The costs of the controls are balanced against the expected benefits. During 2024, the audit committee of the board of directors met regularly with Management, Huntington’s internal auditors, and the independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, to review the scope of their audits and to discuss the evaluation of internal accounting controls and financial reporting matters. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have free access to, and meet confidentially with, the audit committee to discuss appropriate matters. Also, Huntington maintains a disclosure review committee. This committee’s purpose is to design and maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the financial and operating condition of Huntington is properly reported to its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief auditor, and the audit committee of the board of directors in connection with the preparation and filing of periodic reports and the certification of those reports by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. \nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Huntington’s Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). \nBased on that assessment, Management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on the next page.\n \nStephen D. Steinour – Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\nZachary Wasserman – Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 14, 2025 \n2024 Form 10-K     \n91\nTable of \nContents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the\n \nBoard of Directors and Shareholders of\nHuntington Bancshares Incorporated\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management's Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n92\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of the General Reserve of the Allowance for Credit Losses\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, management’s estimate of the allowance for credit losses of $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2024 includes a general reserve that consists of various risk-profile reserve components. The risk-profile components consider items unique to the Company’s structure, policies, processes, and portfolio composition, as well as qualitative measurements and assessments of the Company’s loan portfolios including, but not limited to, economic uncertainty, concentrations, portfolio composition, industry comparisons, and internal review functions. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the general reserve of the allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the general reserve, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the methodology and assumptions used to determine the general reserve, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to the valuation of the general reserve of the allowance for credit losses. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for determining the general reserve, including evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methodology, testing the completeness and accuracy of data utilized by management and evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions relating to the general reserve. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the general reserve involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering portfolio composition, relevant market data, and indicators of economic uncertainty. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methodology and assumptions related to the general reserve.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 14, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015.\n \n2024 Form 10-K     \n93\nTable of \nContents\nHuntington Bancshares Incorporated\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n \nAt December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nAssets\nCash and due from banks\n$\n1,685\n \n$\n1,558\n \nInterest-earning deposits with banks\n11,647\n \n8,765\n \nTrading account securities\n53\n \n125\n \nAvailable-for-sale securities\n27,273\n \n25,305\n \nHeld-to-maturity securities\n16,368\n \n15,750\n \nOther securities\n823\n \n725\n \nLoans held for sale (includes $\n652\n and $\n506\n respectively, measured at fair value)\n654\n \n516\n \nLoans and leases (includes $\n173\n and $\n174\n respectively, measured at fair value)\n130,042\n \n121,982\n \nAllowance for loan and lease losses\n(\n2,244\n)\n(\n2,255\n)\nNet loans and leases (1)\n127,798\n \n119,727\n \nBank owned life insurance\n2,793\n \n2,759\n \nAccrued income and other receivables\n2,190\n \n1,646\n \nPremises and equipment\n1,066\n \n1,109\n \nGoodwill\n5,561\n \n5,561\n \nServicing rights and other intangible assets\n677\n \n672\n \nOther assets (1)\n5,642\n \n5,150\n \nTotal assets\n$\n204,230\n \n$\n189,368\n \nLiabilities and shareholders’ equity\nLiabilities\nDeposits:\nDemand deposits—noninterest-bearing\n$\n29,345\n \n$\n30,967\n \nInterest-bearing\n133,103\n \n120,263\n \nTotal deposits\n162,448\n \n151,230\n \nShort-term borrowings\n199\n \n620\n \nLong-term debt (1) (includes $\n821\n and $\n0\n, respectively, measured at fair value)\n16,374\n \n12,394\n \nOther liabilities (1)\n5,427\n \n5,726\n \nTotal liabilities\n184,448\n \n169,970\n \nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities (Note 21)\nShareholders’ equity\nPreferred stock\n1,989\n \n2,394\n \nCommon stock\n15\n \n15\n \nCapital surplus\n15,484\n \n15,389\n \nLess treasury shares, at cost\n(\n86\n)\n(\n91\n)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n2,866\n)\n(\n2,676\n)\nRetained earnings \n5,204\n \n4,322\n \nTotal Huntington shareholders’ equity\n19,740\n \n19,353\n \nNon-controlling interest\n42\n \n45\n \nTotal equity\n19,782\n \n19,398\n \nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n204,230\n \n$\n189,368\n \nCommon shares authorized (par value of $\n0.01\n)\n2,250,000,000\n \n2,250,000,000\n \nCommon shares outstanding\n1,453,635,809\n \n1,448,319,953\n \nTreasury shares outstanding\n6,984,102\n \n7,403,008\n \nPreferred stock, authorized shares\n6,617,808\n \n6,617,808\n \nPreferred shares outstanding\n877,500\n \n881,587\n \n(1)\nIncludes VIE balances in net loans and leases, long-term debt, other assets, and other liabilities of $\n1.1\n billion, $\n1.0\n billion, $\n264\n million, and $\n109\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024, and VIE balances in other assets, and other liabilities of $\n82\n million and $\n57\n million, at December 31, 2023, respectively.

\nContents\nHuntington Bancshares Incorporated\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. \nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations \n— Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (Huntington or the Company) is a multi-state diversified regional bank holding company organized under Maryland law in 1966 and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Through its subsidiaries, including its bank subsidiary, The Huntington National Bank (the Bank), Huntington is engaged in providing full-service commercial and consumer deposit, lending, and other banking services to customers where the Bank has a local market presence and through select national businesses. These include, but are not limited to, payments, mortgage banking, indirect and direct consumer financing, investment banking, capital markets, advisory, equipment financing, distribution finance, investment management, trust, brokerage, insurance, and other financial products and services. \nBasis of Presentation \n— The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in accordance with GAAP and include the accounts of Huntington and its majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs in which Huntington has determined to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Entities in which Huntington holds a controlling financial interest are consolidated. For a voting interest entity, a controlling financial interest is generally where Huntington holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares. For a VIE, a controlling financial interest is where Huntington has the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE. For consolidated entities where Huntington holds less than a 100% interest, Huntington recognizes non-controlling interest (included in shareholders’ equity) for the equity held by minority shareholders and non-controlling profit or loss (included in income attributable to non-controlling interest) for the portion of the entity’s earnings attributable to minority interests. Investments in companies that are not consolidated are accounted for using the equity method when Huntington has the ability to exert significant influence. Investments in non-marketable equity securities for which Huntington does not have the ability to exert significant influence are generally accounted for using fair value or a cost measurement alternative adjusted for impairment and other changes in observable prices. Investments in private investment partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method or the cost measurement alternative are included in other assets and Huntington’s earnings in equity investments are included in other noninterest income. Investments accounted for under the cost measurement alternative and equity methods are periodically evaluated for impairment.\nUse of Estimates \n— The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that significantly affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Huntington utilizes processes that involve the use of significant estimates and the judgments of management in determining the amount of its allowance for credit losses, income taxes, as well as certain fair value measurements. As with any estimate, actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \nCash and cash equivalents \n— For statements of cash flows purposes, cash and cash equivalents are defined as the sum of cash and due from banks and interest-earning deposits at the FRB, included within interest-earning deposits with banks on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSecurities \n— Securities purchased with the intention of recognizing short-term profits or which are actively bought and sold are classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value. The unrealized gains or losses on trading account securities are recorded in other noninterest income. Debt securities purchased that Huntington has the positive intent and ability to hold to their maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost. All other debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recognized and measured at fair value with any change in the fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. All equity securities are classified as other securities. \nSecurities transactions are recognized on the trade date (the date the order to buy or sell is executed). The carrying value plus any related AOCI balance of sold securities is used to compute realized gains and losses. Interest on securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the effective interest method over the period to maturity, is included in interest income.\n100\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nNon-marketable equity securities include stock held for membership and regulatory purposes, such as FHLB stock and FRB stock, and other non-marketable equity securities. These securities are accounted for at cost, evaluated for impairment, and are included in other securities. Other securities also include mutual funds and other marketable equity securities. These securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in other noninterest income.\nLoans and Leases \n— Loans for which Huntington has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff, except loans for which the fair value option has been elected, are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of charge-offs, unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, premiums and discounts, and unearned income. Direct financing leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values, net of unearned and deferred income, and any initial direct costs incurred to originate these leases. Renewal options for leases are at the option of the lessee and are typically not included in the measurement of the lease receivable as they are not considered reasonably certain of exercise. Purchase options are typically at fair value, and as such those options are not considered in the measurement of lease receivables or in lease classification. Interest income is accrued as earned using the interest method. Huntington defers the fees it receives from the origination of loans and leases, as well as the direct costs of those activities. Huntington also acquires loans at premiums and/or discounts to their contractual values. Huntington amortizes loan discounts, premiums, and net loan origination fees and costs over the contractual lives of the related loans using the effective interest method.\nA borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty and receives a modification in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay or a term extension in the current period is disclosed as a modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Huntington may modify loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a way of managing risk and mitigating credit loss from the borrower. Huntington may make various types of modifications and may in certain circumstances use a combination of modification types in order to mitigate future loss.\nImpairment of the residual values of direct financing leases is evaluated quarterly, with impairment arising if the expected fair value is less than the carrying amount. Huntington assesses net investments in leases (including residual values) for impairment and recognizes losses in accordance with the impairment guidance for financial instruments. As such, net investments in leases may be reduced by an allowance for credit losses, with changes recognized as provision expense.\nFor leased equipment, the residual component of a direct financing lease represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Huntington uses industry data, historical experience, and independent appraisals to establish these residual value estimates. Upon expiration of a lease, residual assets are remarketed, resulting in an extension of the lease by the lessee, a lease to a new customer, or purchase of the residual asset by the lessee or another party. Huntington also purchases insurance guaranteeing the value of certain residual assets.\nLoans Held for Sale \n— Loans in which Huntington does not have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as loans held for sale. Loans held for sale are carried at (a) the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell, or (b) fair value where the fair value option is elected. The fair value option is generally elected for mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell.\n \nNonaccrual and Past Due Loans \n— Loans are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 30 days of the contractual due date.\nAny loan in any portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt. When a borrower with debt is discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the debt is not reaffirmed by the borrower, the loan is determined to be collateral dependent and placed on nonaccrual status, unless there is a co-borrower or the repayment is likely to occur based on objective evidence.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n101\nTable of \nContents\nWhen a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income. Commercial loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status at \n90\n-days past due. First-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at \n150\n-days past due. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of \n120\n-days past due or when the related first-lien loan has been identified as nonaccrual. Automobile, RV and marine, and other consumer loans are generally fully charged-off at \n120\n-days past due, and if not fully charged-off are placed on non-accrual. Residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at \n150\n-days past due, with the exception of residential mortgages guaranteed by government agencies which continue to accrue interest at the rate guaranteed by the government agency. \nCash receipts on NALs are applied against principal until the loan or lease has been collected in full, including the charged-off portion, after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income. However, for secured non-reaffirmed debt in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, payments are applied to principal and interest when the borrower has demonstrated a capacity to continue payment of the debt and collection of the debt is reasonably assured.\n Management monitors several factors to evaluate a borrower’s financial condition and their ability to make principal and interest payments. When, in management’s judgment, the borrower’s ability to make required principal and interest payments resumes and collectability is no longer in doubt, supported by sustained repayment history, the loan is returned to accrual status. For loans that are returned to accrual status, cash receipts are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan.\nCollateral-dependent Loans \n— Certain commercial and consumer loans for which repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the loan collateral are considered to be collateral-dependent. \nAllowance for Credit Losses \n— Huntington performs an ACL evaluation on its loan and lease portfolio and its HTM and AFS securities portfolios. The ACL on loan and lease portfolio and HTM securities are provided through an expected loss methodology referred to as CECL methodology. The ACL on AFS securities is provided when a credit loss is deemed to have occurred for securities which Huntington does not intend to sell or is not required to sell. The CECL methodology also applies to credit exposures on off-balance-sheet loan commitments, financial guarantees not accounted for as insurance, including standby letters of credit, and other similar instruments not recognized as derivative financial instruments. \nLoan and Lease portfolio -\n The ACL is deducted from the amortized cost basis of a financial asset or a group of financial assets so that the balance sheet reflects the net amount Huntington expects to collect. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, fair value hedge accounting adjustments, and deferred fees and costs. Subsequent changes (favorable and unfavorable) in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a provision for credit losses or a reversal of provision for credit losses. Management estimates the allowance by utilizing models dependent upon loan risk characteristics and economic parameters. Commercial loan risk characteristics include but are not limited to risk ratings, industry type and maturity type. Consumer loan risk characteristics include but are not limited to FICO scores, LTV, and loan vintages. The economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Huntington’s reasonable and supportable forecast period reverts to a historical norm based on inputs within approximately two to three years. The reversion period is dependent on the state of the economy at the beginning of the forecast. Historical credit experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, with adjustments made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency levels and terms, as well as for changes in the macroeconomic environment. The contractual terms of financial assets are adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions outside of Huntington’s control. \nThe ACL is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that are determined to have unique risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis by management. If a loan is determined to be collateral dependent or meets the criteria to apply the collateral dependent practical expedient, expected credit losses are determined based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, less costs to sell as appropriate. \nManagement believes the products within each of the entity’s portfolio classes exhibit similar risk characteristics. Huntington has identified its portfolio classes as disclosed in Note 4 - “\nLoans and Leases\n.” \n102\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nIn addition to the transaction reserve described above, Huntington also maintains a general reserve that consists of various risk-profile reserve components. The risk-profile components consider items unique to Huntington’s structure, policies, processes, and portfolio composition, as well as qualitative measurements and assessments of the loan portfolios including, but not limited to, economic uncertainty, concentrations, portfolio composition, industry comparisons and internal review functions.\nHuntington has elected to exclude accrued interest receivable from the measurement of its ACL given the well-defined non-accrual policies in place for all loan portfolios which results in timely reversal of outstanding interest through interest income. \nThe estimate for the off-balance sheet exposures, the AULC, is determined using the same procedures and methodologies as used for the loan and lease portfolio supplemented by the information related to future draws and related credit loss expectations. The AULC is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nHTM Securities\n - The allowance for HTM debt securities is estimated using a CECL methodology. Any expected credit loss is provided through the allowance for credit loss on HTM securities and is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the security so that the balance sheet reflects the net amount Huntington expects to collect. Nearly all of Huntington’s HTM debt securities are issued by U.S. government entities and agencies. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies, and have a long history of no credit losses. Accordingly, there is a zero credit loss expectation on these securities. \nAFS Securitie\ns - Huntington evaluates its AFS investment securities portfolio on a quarterly basis for indicators of impairment. Huntington assesses whether an impairment has occurred when the fair value of a debt security is less than the amortized cost at the balance sheet date. Management reviews the amount of unrealized loss, the credit rating history, market trends of similar security classes, time remaining to maturity, and the source of both interest and principal payments to identify securities which could potentially be impaired. For those debt securities that Huntington intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell, before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is considered to be impaired and is recognized in provision for credit losses. For those debt securities that Huntington does not intend to sell or is not more likely than not required to sell, prior to expected recovery of amortized cost basis, the credit portion of the impairment is recognized through an allowance in provision for credit losses while the noncredit portion is recognized in OCI. In determining the credit portion, Huntington uses a discounted cash flow analysis, which includes evaluating the timing and amount of the expected cash flows. Non-credit-related impairment results from other factors, including increased liquidity spreads and higher interest rates. \nCharge-off of Uncollectible Loans \n— Any loan in any portfolio may be charged-off prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred. Loss confirming events include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued delinquency, foreclosure, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment. Additionally, discharged, collateral dependent non-reaffirmed debt in Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a charge-off to estimated collateral value, less anticipated selling costs, unless the repayment is likely to occur based on objective evidence.\nCommercial loans and leases are generally either charged-off or written down to net realizable value at \n90\n-days past due. Automobile, RV and marine, and other consumer loans are generally charged-off at \n120\n-days past due. First-lien and junior-lien home equity loans are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at \n150\n-days past due and \n120\n-days past due, respectively. Residential mortgages are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral at \n150\n-days past due.\nCollateral\n — Huntington pledges assets as collateral as required for various transactions, including security repurchase agreements, public deposits, loan notes, derivative financial instruments, short-term borrowings, and long-term borrowings. Assets that have been pledged as collateral, including those that can be sold or repledged by the secured party, continue to be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nHuntington also accepts collateral, primarily as part of various transactions including derivative instruments and security resale agreements. Collateral received is excluded from the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n103\nTable of \nContents\nPremises and Equipment \n— Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Buildings and building improvements are depreciated over an average of \n30\n to \n40\n years and \n10\n to \n30\n years, respectively. Land improvements and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over an average of \n5\n to \n20\n years, while equipment is depreciated over a range of \n3\n to \n10\n years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset’s useful life or the lease term, including any renewal periods for which renewal is reasonably assured. Premises and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nMortgage Servicing Rights \n— Huntington recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans as an asset when servicing is contractually separated from the underlying mortgage loans by sale or securitization of the loans with servicing rights retained or when purchased. MSRs are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All MSR assets are recorded at fair value. Any change in the fair value of MSRs during the period is recorded in mortgage banking income.\n \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets —\n Under the acquisition method of accounting, the net assets of entities acquired by Huntington are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess cost of consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1\nst\n of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized either on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nOperating Leases (Lessee) \n—\n \nHuntington has elected not to include non-lease components in the measurement of right-of-use assets, and as such allocates the costs attributable to such components, where those costs are not separately identifiable, via per-square-foot costing analysis developed by the entity for owned and leased spaces. Huntington uses a portfolio approach to develop discount rates as its lease portfolio is comprised of substantially all branch space and office space used in the entity’s operations. That rate, an input used in the measurement of the entity’s right-of-use assets, leverages an incremental borrowing rate of appropriate tenor and collateralization.\nDerivative Financial Instruments \n— Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or a liability (in other assets and other liabilities, respectively) and measured at fair value. Accounting for changes in fair value of derivatives depends on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies in a hedging relationship. At inception a derivative contract can be designated as:\n•\na qualifying hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge);\n•\na qualifying hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset, liability or forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge); or\n•\na qualifying hedge of Huntington’s investment in non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities (net investment hedge). \nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that have been designated as net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, and reclassified into earnings during the period the foreign entity is substantially liquidated or other elements of the currency translation adjustment are reclassified into earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in current period earnings.\n104\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nFor those derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied, Huntington formally documents the hedging relationship and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, and, unless the hedge meets all of the criteria to assume there is no ineffectiveness, the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging instrument. Huntington typically assesses effectiveness using statistical regression at inception and on an ongoing basis.\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when:\n•\nthe derivative is no longer effective or expected to be effective in offsetting changes in the fair value, cash flows or changes in net investment of a hedged item (including firm commitments or forecasted transactions);\n•\nthe derivative expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised;\n•\nthe forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring by the end of the originally specified time period;\n•\nthe hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment; or\n•\nthe designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is removed.\nWhen hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value will be recorded in current period earnings unless re-designated.\nHuntington offsets the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and the fair value for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement.\nFair Value Measurements \n— The Company records or discloses certain of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value measurements are classified within one of three levels in a valuation hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\n•\nLevel 1\n – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2\n – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n•\nLevel 3\n – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nBank Owned Life Insurance —\n Huntington’s bank owned life insurance policies are recorded at their cash surrender value. Huntington recognizes tax-exempt income from the periodic increases in the cash surrender value of these policies and from death benefits. A portion of the cash surrender value is supported by holdings in separate accounts. Book value protection for the separate accounts is provided by the insurance carriers and a highly rated major bank.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n105\nTable of \nContents\nTransfers of Financial Assets and Securitizations \n— Transfers of financial assets in which we have surrendered control over the transferred assets are accounted for as sales. In assessing whether control has been surrendered, Huntington considers whether the transferee would be a consolidated affiliate, the existence and extent of any continuing involvement in the transferred financial assets, and the impact of all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with, or in contemplation of, the transfer, even if they were not entered into at the time of transfer. Control is generally considered to have been surrendered when (i) the transferred assets have been legally isolated from Huntington or any of its consolidated affiliates, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (ii) the transferee (or, if the transferee is an entity whose sole purpose is to engage in securitization or asset-backed financing that is constrained from pledging or exchanging the assets it receives, each third-party holder of its beneficial interests) has the right to pledge or exchange the assets (or beneficial interests) it received without any constraints that provide more than a trivial benefit to Huntington, and (iii) neither Huntington nor its consolidated affiliates and agents have (a) both the right and obligation under any agreement to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity, (b) the unilateral ability to cause the holder to return specific financial assets that also provides Huntington with a more-than-trivial benefit (other than through a cleanup call) or (c) an agreement that permits the transferee to require Huntington to repurchase the transferred assets at a price so favorable that it is probable that it will require Huntington to repurchase them.\nIf the sale criteria are met, the transferred financial assets are removed from the balance sheet and a gain or loss on sale is recognized. If the sale criteria are not met, the transfer is recorded as a secured borrowing in which the assets remain on the balance sheet and the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a liability. For the majority of financial asset transfers, it is clear whether or not Huntington has surrendered control. For other transfers, such as in the case of complex transactions or where Huntington have continuing involvement, we generally obtain a legal opinion as to whether the transfer results in a true sale by law.\nGains and losses on the loans and leases sold and servicing rights associated with loan and lease sales are determined when the related loans or leases are sold to either a securitization trust or third-party. For loan or lease sales with servicing retained, a servicing asset is recorded at fair value for the right to service the loans sold.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits —\n Huntington recognizes the funded status of the postretirement benefit plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net postretirement benefit cost charged to current earnings related to these plans is predominantly based on various actuarial assumptions regarding expected future experience.\nCertain employees are participants in various defined contribution and other non-qualified supplemental retirement plans. Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to current earnings. \nIn addition, Huntington maintains a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions to the plan are charged to current earnings.\nRevenue Recognition — \nHuntington earns a variety of revenue including interest and fees from customers as well as revenues from non-customers. Certain sources of revenue are recognized within interest or fee income and are outside of the scope of ASC 606. Other sources of revenue fall within the scope of ASC 606 and are generally recognized within noninterest income. \nHuntington recognizes revenue when the performance obligations related to the transfer of goods or services under the terms of a contract are satisfied. Some obligations are satisfied at a point in time while others are satisfied over a period of time. Revenue is recognized as the amount of consideration to which Huntington expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. When consideration includes a variable component, the amount of consideration attributable to variability is included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that significant revenue recognized will not be reversed when uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Generally, the variability relating to the consideration is explicitly stated in the contracts, but may also arise from Huntington’s customer business practices, for example, waiving certain fees related to customer’s deposit accounts. Huntington’s contracts generally do not contain terms that require significant judgement to determine the variability impacting the transaction price. \n106\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nControl is transferred to a customer either at a point in time or over time. A performance obligation is deemed satisfied when the control over goods or services is transferred to the customer. To determine when control is transferred at a point in time, Huntington considers indicators, including, but not limited to, the right to payment for the asset, transfer of significant risk and rewards of ownership of the asset and acceptance of the asset by the customer.\n \nRefer to Note 14 - “\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n” for details related to revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).\nIncome Taxes \n— Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future book and tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income at the time of enactment of such change in tax rates. \nAny interest or penalties due for payment of income taxes are included in the provision for income taxes. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is recorded. All positive and negative evidence is reviewed when determining how much of a valuation allowance is recognized on a quarterly basis. In determining the requirements for a valuation allowance, sources of possible taxable income are evaluated including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in appropriate carryback years, and tax-planning strategies. Huntington applies a more likely than not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties.\nShare-Based Compensation \n— Huntington uses the fair value based method of accounting for awards of HBAN stock granted to employees under various share-based compensation plans. Share-based compensation costs are recognized prospectively for all new awards granted under these plans. Compensation expense relating to stock options is calculated using a methodology that is based on the underlying assumptions of the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is charged to expense over the requisite service period (e.g., vesting period) taking into account retirement eligibility. Compensation expense relating to restricted stock awards is based upon the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and is charged to earnings over the requisite service period (e.g., vesting period) taking into account the retirement eligibility of the award.\nStock Repurchases \n— Acquisitions of Huntington stock are recorded at cost.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n107\nTable of \nContents\n2. \nACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE\nAccounting standards adopted in the current period\nStandard\nSummary of guidance\nEffects on financial Statements\nASU 2023-02 - Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method \n•\nPermits the election of the proportional amortization method for any tax equity investment that meets specific criteria. \n•\nRequires that the election be made on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis.\n•\nReceipt of tax credits must be accounted for using the flow through method.\n•\nRequires that a liability be recorded for delayed equity contributions. \n•\nExpands disclosure requirements for the nature of investments and financial statement effect. \n•\nHuntington adopted the standard effective January 1, 2024 on a modified retrospective basis.                                                                         \n•\nThe adoption did not result in a material impact on Huntington’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nASU 2023-07 - Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvement to Reportable Segments\n•\nRequires disclosure of the position and title of the CODM and significant segment expenses that the CODM is regularly provided.      \n•\nRequires the disclosure of other segment items representing the difference between segment revenue and expense and the profit and loss measure of the segment.   \n•\nAllows for the CODM to use more than one measure of segment profit and loss, as long as one measure is consistent with GAAP.\n•\nHuntington adopted the standard effective for the year ended December 31, 2024. \n•\nThe adoption did not result in a material impact on Huntington’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n•\nThe amendments have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented and segment expense categories are based on the categories identified at adoption. \n•\nRefer to Note 24 - “\nSegment Reporting\n” for additional disclosure information.\nAccounting standards yet to be adopted\nStandard\nSummary of guidance\nEffects on financial statements\nASU 2023-09 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n•\nRequires a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and reporting currency amounts between the reported amount of income tax expense (or benefit) to the amount of statutory federal income tax at current rates for specified categories using specified disaggregation criteria.\n•\nThe amount of net income taxes paid for federal, state, and foreign taxes, as well as the amount paid to any jurisdiction that net taxes exceed a 5% quantitative threshold. \n•\nThe amendments will require the disclosure of pre-tax income disaggregated between domestic and foreign, as well as income tax expense disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign. \n•\nEffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.\n•\nEarly adoption is permitted in any annual period where financial statements have not yet been issued.\n•\nThe amendments should be applied on a prospective basis but retrospective application is permitted.\n•\nHuntington does not expect adoption of the standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n108\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\n3. \nINVESTMENT SECURITIES AND OTHER SECURITIES\nDebt securities purchased in which Huntington has the intent and ability to hold to their maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities.

public and trust deposits, trading account liabilities, U.S. Treasury demand notes, security repurchase agreements and to support borrowing capacity totaled $\n37.7\n billion and $\n35.1\n billion, respectively. There were no securities of a single issuer, which were not governmental or government-sponsored, that exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity at either December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, substantially all HTM debt securities are comprised of securities issued by government sponsored entities or are explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. In addition, there were no HTM debt securities considered past due at December 31, 2024.\nBased on an evaluation of available information including security type, counterparty credit quality, past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that are relevant to collectability of cash flows, as of December 31, 2024, Huntington has concluded that, except for \none\n municipal bond classified as an AFS debt security for which $\n2\n million of write-downs were recognized during 2024, it expects to receive all contractual cash flows from each security held in its AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio.

If the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated, the loan may weaken or the collateral may be inadequate to protect Huntington’s position in the future. For these reasons, Huntington considers the loans to be potential problem loans.\n•\nSubstandard\n - Inadequately protected loans resulting from the borrower’s ability to repay, equity, and/or the collateral pledged to secure the loan. These loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. It is likely Huntington will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated.\n•\nDoubtful\n - Loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as Substandard, with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is high.\nLoans are generally assigned a category of \n“Pass” \nrating upon initial approval and subsequently updated as appropriate based on the borrower’s financial performance.\nCommercial loans categorized as OLEM, Substandard, or Doubtful are considered Criticized loans. Commercial loans categorized as Substandard or Doubtful are both considered Classified loans.\nFor all classes within the consumer loan portfolios, borrower credit bureau scores are monitored as an indicator of credit quality. A credit bureau score is a credit score developed by FICO based on data provided by the credit bureaus and refreshed at least quarterly. The credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders, regulators, rating agencies, and consumers. The higher the credit bureau score, the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore, an indicator of higher credit quality.\nHuntington assesses the risk in the loan portfolio by utilizing numerous risk characteristics. The classifications described above, and also presented in the table below, represent one of those characteristics that are closely monitored in the overall credit risk management processes.\n2024

Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nHuntington will modify the contractual terms of loans to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties as a way to mitigate loss, proactively work with borrowers in financial difficulty, or to comply with regulations regarding the treatment of certain bankruptcy filing and discharge situations. A restructured note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan. \n A debtor is considered to be experiencing financial difficulty when there is significant doubt about the debtor’s ability to make required payments on the debt or to get equivalent financing from another creditor at a market rate for similar debt. A loan placed on nonaccrual because the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty may be returned to accrual status when all contractually due interest and principal has been paid and the borrower demonstrates the financial capacity to continue to pay as agreed, with the risk of loss diminished.\nReported Modification Types\nModifications in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other than insignificant payment delay or a term extension that have occurred in the current reporting period to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are disclosed along with the financial impact of the modifications. \n118\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nHuntington will generally try other forms of relief before principal forgiveness but would define any contractual reduction in the amount of principal due without receiving payment or assets as forgiveness. For the purpose of the disclosure Huntington considers any contractual change in interest rate that results in the borrower receiving a below market rate to be an interest rate reduction. Many factors can go into what is considered an other than insignificant payment delay, for example, the significance of the restructured payment amount relative to the normal loan payment or the relative significance of the delay to the original loan terms. Generally, Huntington would consider any delay in payment of greater than 90 days in the last 12 months to be significant. For the purpose of the disclosure modification of contingent payment features or covenants that would have accelerated payment are not considered term extensions. \nFollowing is a description of what is considered a borrower experiencing financial difficulty by the different loan types:\nCommercial loan modifications\n – Our strategy involving commercial borrowers generally includes working with these borrowers to allow them time to improve their financial position and remain a Huntington customer through restructuring their notes or to restructure elsewhere if necessary. Borrowers that are rated substandard or worse in accordance with the regulatory definition, or that cannot otherwise restructure at market terms and conditions, are considered to be experiencing financial difficulty. A subsequent restructuring or modification of a loan may occur when either the loan matures according to the terms of the modified agreement, or the borrower requests a change to the loan agreements. It is subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions, both new and existing. \nConsumer loan modifications\n – Consumer loans in which a borrower requires a modification as a result of negative changes to their financial condition or to avoid default, generally indicate the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The primary modifications made to consumer loans are amortization, maturity date and interest rate changes. Consumer borrowers identified as experiencing financial difficulty are unable to refinance their loans through the Company’s normal origination channels or through other independent sources. Most, but not all, of the loans may be delinquent. \nImpact on Credit Quality of Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nHuntington’s ALLL is influenced by loan level characteristics that inform the assessed propensity to default. As such, the provision for credit losses is impacted primarily by changes in such loan level characteristics, such as payment performance. Commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are applied credit quality risk indicators that reflect the increase in default characteristics so that that the ALLL reflects the risk of loss. Borrowers experiencing financial difficulty can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n119\nTable of \nContents\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost basis of loans modified during the reporting period to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, disaggregated by class of financing receivable and type of modification.\nAmortized Cost\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nInterest rate reduction\nTerm extension\nPayment deferral\nCombo - interest rate reduction and term extension\nTotal\n% of total loan class (1)\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n113\n \n$\n209\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n64\n \n$\n386\n \n0.68\n \n%\nCommercial real estate\n—\n \n233\n \n—\n \n24\n \n257\n \n2.32\n \nResidential mortgage\n—\n \n51\n \n6\n \n4\n \n61\n \n0.25\n \nAutomobile\n—\n \n11\n \n—\n \n1\n \n12\n \n0.08\n \nHome equity\n—\n \n6\n \n—\n \n9\n \n15\n \n0.15\n \nRV and marine\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n0.02\n \nOther consumer\n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n0.11\n \nTotal loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in which modifications were made\n$\n115\n \n$\n511\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n102\n \n$\n734\n \n0.59\n \n%\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n64\n \n$\n387\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n455\n \n0.90\n \n%\nCommercial real estate\n2\n \n151\n \n—\n \n4\n \n157\n \n1.26\n \nResidential mortgage\n—\n \n58\n \n2\n \n4\n \n64\n \n0.27\n \nAutomobile\n—\n \n14\n \n—\n \n1\n \n15\n \n0.12\n \nHome equity\n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n10\n \n12\n \n0.12\n \nRV and marine\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n0.02\n \nOther consumer\n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n0.07\n \nTotal loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in which modifications were made\n$\n67\n \n$\n613\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n705\n \n0.58\n \n%\n(1)\nRepresents the amortized cost of loans modified during the reporting period as a percentage of the period-end loan balance by class. \nThe following table describes the financial effect of the modification made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nInterest Rate Reduction (1)\nTerm Extension (1)\nWeighted-average contractual interest rate\nWeighted-average years added to the life\nFrom\nTo\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nCommercial and industrial\n8.16\n \n%\n7.12\n \n%\n1.0\nCommercial real estate\n8.26\n \n7.90\n \n0.9\nResidential mortgage\n6.8\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nCommercial and industrial\n8.62\n \n%\n8.05\n \n%\n1.0\nCommercial real estate\n \n \n1.0\nResidential mortgage\n \n \n7.7\n(1)\nCertain disclosures related to financial effects of modifications do not include those deemed to be immaterial. \n120\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nThe performance of loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in which modifications were made is closely monitored to understand the effectiveness of modification efforts.

The increase in the total ACL was driven by loan and lease growth throughout 2024, partially offset by a modest reduction in overall coverage ratios reflective of the current macroeconomic environment. \nThe Commercial ACL was $\n1.6\n billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $\n1\n million from December 31, 2023. C&I loan and lease growth of $\n6.2\n billion was offset by the combination of a modest reduction in the C&I coverage ratios due to improvement in the macroeconomic environment and a $\n1.3\n billion decrease in CRE loans and leases.\nThe Consumer ACL was $\n818\n million at December 31, 2024, an increase of $\n47\n million from the December 31, 2023 balance. The increase was primarily due to a $\n3.0\n billion increase in consumer loans.\nThe baseline economic scenario used in the December 31, 2024 ACL determination assumes the labor market has softened with the unemployment rate projected at 4.2% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Marginal improvement is expected moving forward with unemployment returning to 4% by 2026. The Federal Reserve is projected to continue the cycle of rate cuts that started in September 2024, with gradual cuts forecast throughout 2025 and 2026 until reaching a federal funds rate of 3% by mid-2026. Inflation is forecasted to approach the Federal Reserve’s target level of 2% by the end of 2024 and stabilize in 2025. GDP is forecast to show marginal improvement from the estimated fourth quarter 2024 level of 2.0%, ending the fourth quarter of 2025 at 2.1%.\n122\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nThe economic scenarios used included elevated levels of economic uncertainty including the impact of specific challenges in the commercial real estate industry, recent inflation levels, the U.S labor market, the expected path of interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve, and the impact of significant conflicts on-going around the world. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the December 31, 2024 ACL included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components to address uncertainty not measured within the quantitative transaction reserve.\n6. \nMORTGAGE LOAN SALES AND SERVICING RIGHTS \nResidential Mortgage Portfolio\nThe following table summarizes activity relating to residential mortgage loans sold with servicing retained.\n \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nResidential mortgage loans sold with servicing retained\n$\n4,124\n \n$\n4,109\n \n$\n5,686\n \nPretax gains resulting from above loan sales (1)\n78\n \n58\n \n137\n \nTotal servicing, late, and other ancillary fees (1)\n104\n \n98\n \n91\n \n(1)\nIncluded in mortgage banking income.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in MSRs recorded using the fair value method.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nFair value, beginning of period\n$\n515\n \n$\n494\n \nNew servicing assets created\n54\n \n63\n \nServicing assets sold\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nChange in fair value during the period due to:\nTime decay (1)\n(\n25\n)\n(\n24\n)\nPayoffs (2)\n(\n30\n)\n(\n24\n)\nChanges in valuation inputs or assumptions (3)\n60\n \n7\n \nFair value, end of period\n$\n573\n \n$\n515\n \nLoans serviced for third parties, unpaid principal balance, end of period\n$\n33,696\n \n$\n33,237\n \n(1)\nRepresents decrease in value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled principal payments and partial loan paydowns.\n(2)\nRepresents decrease in value associated with loans that paid off during the period.\n(3)\nRepresents change in value resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates.\nMSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices.

Huntington has elected the fair value option for these notes. See Note 18 - “Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities” for additional information. To the extent losses exceed certain thresholds, the principal and interest payable on the notes may be reduced by a portion of the Company’s aggregate net losses on the reference pool of loans, with losses allocated to note classes in reverse order of payment priority. \nAdditional information about Huntington’s CLN issuances is as follows.\nAt December 31, 2024\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nWeighted Average Interest Rate\nReference Pool Net Balance\nPrincipal Outstanding\nCLN 2024-1 due 2032 (1)\n6.66\n \n%\n$\n3,014\n \n$\n366\n \nCLN 2024-2 due 2032 (2)\n6.03\n \n3,740\n \n451\nTotal\n$\n6,754\n \n$\n817\n \nFair value adjustment\n4\nCarrying value\n$\n821\n \n(1)\nConsists of multiple classes of loans.

Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock options, restricted stock units and awards, performance share units, and shares held in deferred compensation plans. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive. \nThe calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions, except per share data, share count in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBasic earnings per common share:\nNet income attributable to Huntington\n$\n1,940\n \n$\n1,951\n \n$\n2,238\n \nDividends on preferred shares\n134\n \n142\n \n113\n \nImpact of preferred stock redemptions and repurchases\n5\n \n(\n8\n)\n—\n \nNet income available to common shareholders\n$\n1,801\n \n$\n1,817\n \n$\n2,125\n \nAverage common shares issued and outstanding\n1,451,421\n \n1,446,449\n \n1,441,279\n \nBasic earnings per common share\n$\n1.24\n \n$\n1.26\n \n$\n1.47\n \nDiluted earnings per common share:\nAverage dilutive potential common shares:\nStock options, restricted stock units and awards, and performance share units\n17,669\n \n14,456\n \n17,534\n \nShares held in deferred compensation plans\n7,352\n \n7,111\n \n6,407\n \nAverage dilutive potential common shares\n25,021\n \n21,567\n \n23,941\n \nTotal diluted average common shares issued and outstanding\n1,476,442\n \n1,468,016\n \n1,465,220\n \nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n1.22\n \n$\n1.24\n \n$\n1.45\n \nAnti-dilutive awards (1)\n4,534\n \n11,039\n \n5,303\n \n(1)\nReflects the total number of shares related to outstanding options that have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the impact would have been anti-dilutive.\n130\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\n14. \nREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\nRevenue is segregated based on the nature of product and services offered as part of contractual arrangements. Revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606 is broadly segregated within the following noninterest income categories: \n•\nPayments and cash management revenue \nprimarily includes interchange fees earned on debit cards and credit cards and fees earned from providing cash management services to corporate deposit customers. Within the scope of ASC 606, Huntington recognizes debit and credit card interchange fees for services performed related to authorization and settlement of a cardholder’s transaction with a merchant. Revenue is recognized when a cardholder’s transaction is approved and settled. Certain volume or transaction based interchange expenses (net of rebates) paid to the payment network reduce the interchange revenue and are presented net on the income statement. Similarly, rewards payable under a reward program to cardholders are recognized as a reduction of the transaction price and are presented net against the interchange revenue. Revenue from providing cash management services to corporate deposit customers is recognized over the period of time services are rendered.\n•\nWealth and asset management revenue \nprimarily includes fee income generated from providing wealth and asset management services to personal, corporate, and institutional customers, including, but not limited to, fees and commissions earned from trust and investment management services, sales of annuity products, and tax reporting services. Within the scope of ASC 606, Huntington recognizes revenue from wealth and asset management services are rendered over a period of time. Huntington may also recognize revenue from referring a customer to outside third-parties to purchase annuities and mutual funds which is recognized in the period earned. \n•\nCustomer deposit and loan fees \nprimarily includes fees and other charges Huntington receives related to service charges on deposit accounts, loan commitments and standby letters of credits, and other deposit and lending activity. Within the scope of ASC 606, Huntington recognizes fees and other charges for providing various services, including, but not limited to, maintaining accounts, providing overdraft services, transferring funds, and accepting and executing stop-payment orders for customers. Revenue includes both fixed fees (e.g., account maintenance fee), recognized over a period of time, and transaction fees (e.g., wire-transfer fee), recognized when a specific service is performed. Huntington may, from time to time, waive certain fees for customers but generally does not reduce the transaction price to reflect variability for future reversals due to the insignificance of the amounts. Waiver of fees reduces the revenue in the period the waiver is granted to the customer.\n•\nCapital markets and advisory fees \nprimarily includes advisory fees for merger, acquisition and capital markets activity,\n \ninterest rate derivative fees, underwriting fees, foreign exchange fees, loan syndication fees, and fees earned from customer-related sales activity. Within the scope of ASC 606, Huntington recognizes revenue associated with capital markets and advisory fees when the related transaction closes.\n•\nLeasing revenue \nprimarily includes income from operating lease payments and termination of leases. Within the scope of ASC 606, Huntington recognizes leasing revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Inherent variability in the transaction price is not recognized until the uncertainty affecting the variability is resolved.\n•\nInsurance income \nprimarily includes agency commissions from the sale of insurance premiums to customers. All insurance income is recognized within the scope of ASC 606. Huntington receives commissions from the sales of insurance policies to customers. The initial commission is recognized when the insurance policy is sold to a customer.

Payment terms and conditions vary amongst services and customers, and thus impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Some fees may be paid before any service is rendered and accordingly, such fees are deferred until the obligations pertaining to those fees are satisfied. Most Huntington contracts with customers are cancelable by either party without penalty or they are short-term in nature, with a contract duration of less than one year. Accordingly, most revenue deferred for the reporting period ended December 31, 2024 is expected to be earned within one year. Huntington does not have significant balances of contract assets or contract liabilities and any change in those balances during the reporting period ended December 31, 2024 was determined to be immaterial.\n15. \nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION \nShare-based awards are eligible for issuance under the Company’s long term incentive plan. The plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share units, and other awards to officers, directors, and other employees. At December 31, 2024, \n37\n million shares were available for future grants. \nHuntington issues shares to fulfill share-based award vesting from available authorized common shares. At December 31, 2024, Huntington believes there are adequate authorized common shares to satisfy anticipated share-based award vesting in 2025. \nThe following table presents total share-based compensation expense and related tax benefit.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nShare-based compensation expense (1)\n$\n133\n \n$\n114\n \n$\n119\n \nTax benefit\n24\n \n19\n \n20\n \n(1)\nCompensation costs are included in personnel costs on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nStock Options\nStock options, awarded by Huntington, are granted at the closing market price on the date of the grant and vest ratably over \nfour years\n or when other conditions are met.

Restricted stock units can be settled in shares or cash depending on the award and, for the most part, provide either accumulated cash dividends during the vesting period or, accrue a dividend equivalent that is paid upon vesting. Restricted stock units are subject to certain service restrictions. Performance share units are payable contingent upon Huntington achieving certain predefined performance objectives over a \nthree-year\n measurement period.

The Plan no longer accrues service benefits to participants and provides benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels. Huntington’s funding policy is to contribute an annual amount that is at least equal to the minimum funding requirements but not more than the amount deductible under the Internal Revenue Code. There were \nno\n required minimum contributions during 2024. \nThe following table shows the weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost.\nAt December 31, \n2024\n2023\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:\nDiscount rate\n5.67\n \n%\n5.15\n \n%\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost:\nDiscount rate\n5.15\n \n5.41\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n5.50\n \n5.00\n \nThe following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation of the Plan with the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAt December 31, \n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of measurement year\n$\n687\n \n$\n692\n \nChanges due to:\nService cost\n3\n \n3\n \nInterest cost\n34\n \n36\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n34\n)\n(\n33\n)\nSettlements\n(\n9\n)\n(\n16\n)\nActuarial (losses) gains\n(\n35\n)\n5\n \nTotal changes\n(\n41\n)\n(\n5\n)\nProjected benefit obligation at end of measurement year\n$\n646\n \n$\n687\n \n134\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nThe following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of the fair value of Plan assets.\nAt December 31, \n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of measurement year\n$\n729\n \n$\n740\n \nChanges due to:\nActual return on plan assets\n(\n8\n)\n39\n \nSettlements\n(\n9\n)\n(\n17\n)\nBenefits paid\n(\n34\n)\n(\n33\n)\nTotal changes\n(\n51\n)\n(\n11\n)\nFair value of plan assets at end of measurement year\n$\n678\n \n$\n729\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of Plan assets was $\n32\n million and is recorded in other assets.\nThe following table shows the components of net periodic benefit costs recognized.\nYear Ended December 31, (1)\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nService cost\n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \nInterest cost\n34\n \n36\n \n22\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n46\n)\n(\n43\n)\n(\n41\n)\nAmortization of loss\n2\n \n1\n \n9\n \nSettlements\n4\n \n7\n \n15\n \nBenefit costs\n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n4\n \n$\n8\n \n(1)    Pension costs are recognized in other noninterest income in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income\n.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Northern Trust, as trustee, held all Plan assets. \nThe Plan assets consisted of investments in a variety of cash equivalent, corporate and government fixed income, and equity investments as follows.\nFair Value at December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nCash equivalents:\nMutual funds-money market\n$\n11\n \n2\n \n%\n$\n17\n \n2\n \n%\nFixed income:\nCorporate obligations\n212\n \n31\n \n234\n \n32\n \nU.S. Government obligations\n69\n \n10\n \n70\n \n10\n \nMunicipal obligations\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \nCollective trust funds\n273\n \n40\n \n297\n \n42\n \nEquities:\nLimited liability companies\n11\n \n2\n \n10\n \n1\n \nCollective trust funds\n78\n \n12\n \n76\n \n10\n \nLimited partnerships\n23\n \n3\n \n24\n \n3\n \nFair value of plan assets\n$\n678\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n729\n \n100\n \n%\n2024 Form 10-K     \n135\nTable of \nContents\nInvestments of the Plan are reported at fair value. The valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of pension plan assets vary depending on the type of asset. At December 31, 2024, mutual money market funds are valued at the closing price reported from an actively traded exchange and are classified as Level 1. Fixed income investments are valued using unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for similar assets are classified as Level 2. Collective trust funds and limited liability companies are valued at net asset value per unit as a practical expedient, which is calculated based on the fair values of the underlying investments held by the fund less its liabilities as reported by the issuer of the fund. The investment in the limited partnerships is reported at net asset value per share as determined by the general partners of each limited partnership, based on their proportionate share of the partnership’s fair value as recorded in the partnership’s audited financial statements. \nThe investment objective of the Plan is to maximize the return on Plan assets over a long-time period, while meeting the Plan obligations. At December 31, 2024, Plan assets had an average duration of \n11.9\n years on investments. The estimated life of benefit obligations was \n9.7\n years. Although it may fluctuate with market conditions, Huntington has targeted a long-term allocation of Plan assets of \n90\n% in bond investments and \n10\n% in equity investments.\nAt December 31, 2024, the following table shows when benefit payments are expected to be paid.\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nPension Benefits\n2025\n$\n53\n \n2026\n54\n \n2027\n54\n \n2028\n53\n \n2029\n53\n \n2030 through 2034\n252\n \nHuntington has a defined contribution plan that is available to eligible employees.

The amounts of accrued tax-related interest and penalties were immaterial at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Further, the amount of net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was immaterial for all periods presented. All of the gross unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized.\nAt December 31, 2024, retained earnings included approximately $\n182\n million of base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions, for which no deferred federal income tax liability has been recognized. Under current law, if these bad debt reserves are used for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses, they will be subject to federal income tax at the corporate rate enacted at the time. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability relating to the cumulative bad debt deduction was approximately $\n38\n million at December 31, 2024.\n18. \nFAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value rarely transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements. There were no such transfers during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nLoans held for sale\nHuntington has elected to apply the FVO for mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell which are included in loans held for sale. Mortgage loans held for sale are classified as Level 2 and are estimated using security prices for similar product types.\nLoans held for investment\nCertain mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell for which the FVO was elected have been reclassified to loans held for investment. These loans continue to be measured at fair value. The fair value of loans held for investment classified as Level 2 are estimated using security prices for similar product types similar to loans held for sale. The fair value of loans held for investment classified as Level 3 is determined using fair value of similar mortgage-backed securities adjusted for loan specific variables.\n138\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nAvailable-for-sale and trading account securities\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include both the available-for-sale and trading account portfolios. Huntington determines the fair value of securities utilizing quoted market prices obtained for identical or similar assets, third-party pricing services, third-party valuation specialists and other observable inputs such as recent trade observations. AFS and trading securities classified as Level 1 use quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical securities at the measurement date. Level 1 positions in these portfolios consist of U.S. Treasury securities. When quoted market prices are not available, fair values are classified as Level 2 using quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices of identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 2 positions in these portfolios consist of U.S. Government and agency debt securities, agency mortgage backed securities, private-label asset-backed securities, certain municipal securities, and other securities. For Level 2 securities Huntington primarily uses prices obtained from third-party pricing services to determine the fair value of securities. Huntington independently evaluates and corroborates the fair value received from pricing services through various methods and techniques, including references to dealer or other market quotes, by reviewing valuations of comparable instruments, and by comparing the prices realized on the sale of similar securities. If relevant market prices are limited or unavailable, valuations may require significant management judgment or estimation to determine fair value, in which case the fair values are classified as Level 3. The Level 3 positions predominantly consist of direct purchase municipal securities. A significant change in the unobservable inputs for these securities may result in a significant change in the ending fair value measurement of these securities.\nDirect purchase municipal securities, in addition to certain private-label CMOs and asset-backed securities, are classified as Level 3 and require estimates to determine fair value which results in greater subjectivity. The fair value is determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique employed by a third-party valuation specialist. The third-party specialist uses assumptions related to yield, prepayment speed, conditional default rates and loss severity based on certain factors such as, credit worthiness of the counterparty, prevailing market rates, and analysis of similar securities. Huntington evaluates the fair values provided by the third-party specialist for reasonableness.\nDerivative assets and liabilities\nDerivatives classified as Level 2 primarily consist of interest rate contracts, which are valued using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates current market interest rates. In addition, Level 2 includes foreign exchange and commodity contracts, which are valued using exchange traded swaps, exchange traded options, and futures market data. Level 2 also includes exchange traded options and forward commitments to deliver mortgage-backed securities, which are valued using quoted prices.\nDerivatives classified as Level 3 consist of interest rate lock agreements related to mortgage loan commitments,  the Visa\n®\n share swap, and credit default swaps.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n139\nTable of \nContents\nMSRs\nMSRs are accounted for using the fair value method and are classified as Level 3. Refer to Note 6 - “\nMortgage Loan Sales and Servicing Rights\n” for information on valuation methodology.\nLong-term debt\nHuntington has elected to apply the fair value option for CLNs structured as long-term debt. CLNs are classified as Level 2 using quoted prices for similar liabilities in active markets, quoted prices of similar liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the assets, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nAssets and Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nThe following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including instruments we have elected the fair value option.\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nNetting Adjustments (1)\nTotal\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAt December 31, 2024\nAssets\nTrading account securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities\n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n— \n$\n1\n \nOther trading account securities\n—\n \n52\n \n—\n \n— \n52\n \nTotal trading account securities\n1\n \n52\n \n—\n \n— \n53\n \nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities\n6,556\n \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n6,556\n \nResidential MBS\n—\n \n10,017\n \n—\n \n— \n10,017\n \nResidential CMO\n—\n \n3,345\n \n—\n \n— \n3,345\n \nCommercial MBS\n—\n \n1,752\n \n—\n \n— \n1,752\n \nOther agencies\n—\n \n130\n \n—\n \n— \n130\n \nMunicipal securities\n—\n \n34\n \n3,954\n \n— \n3,988\n \nCorporate debt\n—\n \n1,055\n \n—\n \n— \n1,055\n \nAsset-backed securities\n—\n \n262\n \n49\n \n— \n311\n \nPrivate-label CMO\n—\n \n88\n \n21\n \n— \n109\n \nOther securities/sovereign debt\n—\n \n10\n \n—\n \n— \n10\n \nTotal available-for-sale securities\n6,556\n \n16,693\n \n4,024\n \n— \n27,273\n \nOther securities\n29\n \n2\n \n—\n \n— \n31\n \nLoans held for sale\n—\n \n652\n \n—\n \n— \n652\n \nLoans held for investment\n—\n \n112\n \n61\n \n— \n173\n \nMSRs\n—\n \n—\n \n573\n \n— \n573\n \nOther assets:\nDerivative assets\n—\n \n606\n \n4\n \n(\n344\n)\n266\n \nAssets held in trust for deferred compensation plans\n191\n \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n191\n \nLiabilities\nLong-term debt\n—\n \n821\n \n—\n \n— \n821\n \nDerivative liabilities\n—\n \n666\n \n2\n \n(\n90\n)\n578\n \n140\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nNetting Adjustments (1)\nTotal\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAt December 31, 2023\nAssets\nTrading account securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities\n$\n91\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n— \n$\n91\n \nOther trading account securities\n—\n \n34\n \n—\n \n— \n34\n \nTotal trading account securities\n91\n \n34\n \n—\n \n— \n125\n \nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities\n2,856\n \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n2,856\n \nResidential MBS\n—\n \n11,382\n \n—\n \n— \n11,382\n \nResidential CMO\n—\n \n3,184\n \n—\n \n— \n3,184\n \nCommercial MBS\n—\n \n1,827\n \n—\n \n— \n1,827\n \nOther agencies\n—\n \n155\n \n—\n \n— \n155\n \nMunicipal securities\n—\n \n38\n \n3,335\n \n— \n3,373\n \nCorporate debt\n—\n \n2,043\n \n—\n \n— \n2,043\n \nAsset-backed securities\n—\n \n281\n \n75\n \n— \n356\n \nPrivate-label CMO\n—\n \n99\n \n20\n \n— \n119\n \nOther securities/sovereign debt\n—\n \n10\n \n—\n \n— \n10\n \nTotal available-for-sale securities\n2,856\n \n19,019\n \n3,430\n \n— \n25,305\n \nOther securities\n30\n \n2\n \n—\n \n— \n32\n \nLoans held for sale\n—\n \n506\n \n—\n \n— \n506\n \nLoans held for investment\n—\n \n120\n \n54\n \n— \n174\n \nMSRs\n—\n \n—\n \n515\n \n— \n515\n \nOther assets:\nDerivative assets\n—\n \n1,720\n \n3\n \n(\n1,330\n)\n393\n \nAssets held in trust for deferred compensation plans\n177\n \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n177\n \nLiabilities\nDerivative liabilities\n—\n \n1,416\n \n5\n \n(\n751\n)\n670\n \n(1)\nAmounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to settle positive and negative positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n141\nTable of \nContents\nThe following tables present a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3.

Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nCertain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, for example, when there is evidence of impairment. The gains (losses) represent the amounts recorded during the period regardless of whether the asset is still held at period end. \nThe amounts measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were as follows.\nFair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nTotal Losses Year Ended\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nCollateral-dependent loans\n$\n192\n \n$\n40\n \n$\n(\n122\n)\n$\n(\n21\n)\n$\n(\n1\n)\nHuntington records nonrecurring adjustments of collateral-dependent loans held for investment. Such amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan. Appraisals are generally obtained to support the fair value of the collateral and incorporate measures such as recent sales prices for comparable properties and cost of construction. Periodically, in cases where the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell, an impairment charge is recognized in the form of a charge-off.\n144\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nSignificant unobservable inputs for assets and liabilities measured at fair value\nThe following table presents quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\nQuantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (1)\nAt December 31, 2024\nAt December 31, 2023\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nValuation Technique\nSignificant Unobservable Input\nRange\nWeighted\n Average\nRange\nWeighted\n Average\nMeasured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nMSRs\nDiscounted cash flow\nConstant prepayment rate\n6\n \n%\n-\n43\n \n%\n8\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n-\n37\n \n%\n9\n \n%\nSpread over forward interest rate swap rates\n5\n \n%\n-\n10\n \n%\n6\n \n%\n5\n \n%\n-\n13\n \n%\n5\n \n%\nMunicipal securities and asset-backed securities \nDiscounted cash flow\nDiscount rate\n4\n \n%\n-\n5\n \n%\n5\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n-\n6\n \n%\n5\n \n%\nCumulative default\n—\n \n%\n-\n39\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n-\n64\n \n%\n6\n \n%\nLoss given default (2)\n20\n \n%\n20\n \n%\n(1)\nCertain disclosures related to quantitative level 3 fair value measurements do not include those deemed to be immaterial.\n(2)\nThe range is not meaningful for this unobservable input.\nThe following provides a general description of the impact of a change in an unobservable input on the fair value measurement and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant/significant. Interrelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs.\nComponents of credit loss estimates including probability of default, constant default, cumulative default, loss given default, cure given deferral, and loss severity, are driven by the ability of the borrowers to pay their loans and the value of the underlying collateral and are impacted by changes in macroeconomic conditions, typically increasing when economic conditions worsen and decreasing when conditions improve. An increase in the estimated prepayment rate typically results in a decrease in estimated credit losses and vice versa. Higher credit loss estimates generally result in lower fair values. Credit spreads generally increase when liquidity risks and market volatility increase and decrease when liquidity conditions and market volatility improve.\nDiscount rates and spread over forward interest rate swap rates typically increase when market interest rates increase and/or credit and liquidity risks increase and decrease when market interest rates decline and/or credit and liquidity conditions improve. Higher discount rates and credit spreads generally result in lower fair market values.\nFair values of financial instruments\nMany of the assets and liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not actively traded, requiring fair values to be estimated by management. These estimations necessarily involve the use of judgment about a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, relevancy of market prices of comparable instruments, expected future cash flows, and appropriate discount rates.\nThe short-term nature of certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include trading account securities, customers’ acceptance liabilities, short-term borrowings, bank acceptances outstanding, and cash and short-term assets, which include cash and due from banks and interest-earning deposits with banks. Loan commitments and letters-of-credit generally have short-term, variable-rate features and contain clauses that limit Huntington’s exposure to changes in customer credit quality.

Designating a derivative as an accounting hedge allows Huntington to recognize gains and losses on the hedging instruments in the income statement line item where the gains and losses on the hedged item are recognized. Gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated in an effective hedge relationship under GAAP immediately impact earnings within the period they occur. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n147\nTable of \nContents\nThe following table presents the fair values and notional values of all derivative instruments included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Balance sheet hedging activity is generally arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment that can be classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are executed to hedge changes in fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt and investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. Cash flow hedges are executed to modify interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes.\n148\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nThe following table presents the gross notional values of derivatives used in Huntington’s asset and liability management activities, identified by the underlying interest rate-sensitive instruments.\nAt December 31, 2024\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nFair Value Hedges\nCash Flow Hedges\nEconomic Hedges\nTotal\nInstruments associated with:\nInvestment securities\n$\n10,987\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n10,987\n \nLoans\n—\n \n23,300\n \n175\n \n23,475\n \nLong-term debt\n11,347\n \n—\n \n—\n \n11,347\n \nTotal notional value\n$\n22,334\n \n$\n23,300\n \n$\n175\n \n$\n45,809\n \nAt December 31, 2023\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nFair Value Hedges\nCash Flow Hedges\nEconomic Hedges\nTotal\nInstruments associated with:\nInvestment securities\n$\n11,649\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n11,649\n \nLoans\n—\n \n16,675\n \n175\n \n16,850\n \nLong-term debt\n9,693\n \n—\n \n—\n \n9,693\n \nTotal notional value\n$\n21,342\n \n$\n16,675\n \n$\n175\n \n$\n38,192\n \nThese derivative financial instruments were entered into for the purpose of managing the interest rate risk of assets and liabilities. Net amounts receivable or payable on contracts hedging either interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities were accrued as an adjustment to either interest income or interest expense. Adjustments to interest income were also recorded for the amounts related to the amortization of premiums for floors that were not included in the measurement of hedge effectiveness, as well as the amounts related to terminated hedges reclassified from AOCI. The net amounts resulted in decreases to net interest income of $\n231\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $\n248\n million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and an increase to net interest income of $\n76\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe changes in fair value of the fair value hedges are recorded through earnings and offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged item.\nHuntington has designated $\n11.0\n billion of interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate investment securities using the portfolio layer method. This approach allows the Company to designate as the hedged item a stated amount of the assets that are not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults and other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows. The fair value portfolio level basis adjustment on our hedged mortgage-backed securities portfolio has not been attributed to the individual available-for-sale securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table presents the change in fair value for derivatives designated as fair value hedges as well as the offsetting change in fair value on the hedged item.\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest rate contracts\nChange in fair value of interest rate swaps hedging investment securities (1)\n$\n(\n246\n)\n$\n(\n284\n)\n$\n875\n \nChange in fair value of hedged investment securities (1)\n239\n \n282\n \n(\n862\n)\nChange in fair value of interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt (2)\n(\n109\n)\n141\n \n(\n300\n)\nChange in fair value of hedged long term debt (2)\n108\n \n(\n141\n)\n300\n \n(1)\nRecognized in Interest income—available-for-sale securities—taxable in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income\n.\n(2)\nRecognized in Interest expense - long-term debt in the \nConsolidated Statements of Income\n.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n149\nTable of \nContents\nThe following amounts were recorded on the balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges.\nAmortized Cost\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment To Hedged Items\nAt December 31,\nAt December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nAssets\nInvestment securities (1)\n$\n16,390\n \n$\n18,241\n \n$\n(\n458\n)\n$\n(\n698\n)\nLiabilities\nLong-term debt (2)\n11,589\n \n9,909\n \n(\n223\n)\n(\n115\n)\n(1)\nAmounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships under the portfolio layer method. The hedged item is a layer of the closed portfolio which is expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging relationship. \n(2)\nExcluded from the above table are the cumulative amount of fair value hedge adjustments remaining for long-term debt for which hedge accounting has been discontinued in the amounts of $(\n56\n) million at December 31, 2024 and $(\n69\n) million at December 31, 2023.\nCash Flow Hedges\nAt December 31, 2024, Huntington had $\n23.3\n billion of interest rate swaps and floors. These are designated as cash flow hedges for variable rate commercial loans. The change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is initially recognized in OCI and is reclassified into income when the hedged item impacts earnings. The initial premium paid for the interest rate floor contracts represents the time value of the contracts and is not included in the measurement of hedge effectiveness. The initial premium paid is amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction to interest income over the contractual life of these contracts.\n At December 31, 2024, the net losses recognized in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months were $\n43\n million.\nDerivatives used in mortgage banking activities\nMortgage loan origination hedging activity\nHuntington uses derivatives, principally loan sale commitments, in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale. Mortgage loan sale commitments and the related interest rate lock commitments are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income. Huntington’s mortgage origination hedging activity is related to economically hedging Huntington’s mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. The value of a newly originated mortgage is not firm until the interest rate is committed or locked. Forward commitments to sell economically hedge the possible loss on interest rate lock commitments due to interest rate change. The position of these derivatives was a net asset of $\n7\n million and net liability of $\n4\n million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Huntington had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of $\n869\n million and $\n674\n million, respectively. These contracts mature in less than one year.\nMSR hedging activity\nHuntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to offset changes in value of its MSRs. These derivatives consist primarily of forward interest rate agreements and forward mortgage contracts. The derivative instruments used are not designated as qualifying hedges. Accordingly, such derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income. Huntington’s MSR economic hedging activity uses securities and derivatives to manage the value of the MSR asset and to mitigate the various types of risk inherent in the MSR asset, including risks related to duration, basis, convexity, volatility, and yield curve. The hedging instruments include forward commitments, TBA securities, Treasury futures contracts, interest rate swaps, and options on interest rate swaps. \n150\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nMSR hedging trading assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Trading gains (losses) are included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \nThe notional value of the derivative financial instruments, the corresponding trading assets and liabilities positions, and net trading gains (losses) related to MSR hedging activity is summarized in the following tables.\nAt December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNotional value\n$\n1,780\n \n$\n1,668\n \nTrading liabilities\n45\n \n69\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTrading (losses) gains\n$\n(\n60\n)\n$\n(\n10\n)\n$\n(\n109\n)\nDerivatives used in customer related activities\nVarious derivative financial instruments are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and investing objectives and for their risk management purposes. Derivative financial instruments used in trading activities consist of commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange contracts. Huntington enters into offsetting third-party contracts with approved, reputable counterparties with substantially matching terms and currencies in order to economically hedge significant exposure related to derivatives used in trading activities.\nThe interest rate or price risk of customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties. The credit risk to these customers is evaluated and included in the calculation of fair value. Foreign currency derivatives help the customer hedge risk and reduce exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates. Transactions are primarily in liquid currencies with Canadian dollars and Euros comprising a majority of all transactions. Commodity derivatives help the customer hedge risk and reduce exposure to fluctuations in the price of various commodities. Hedging of energy-related products and base metals comprise the majority of these transactions.\nThe net fair values of these derivative financial instruments, for which the gross amounts are included in other assets or other liabilities at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were $\n72\n million and $\n47\n million, respectively. The total notional values of derivative financial instruments used by Huntington on behalf of customers, including offsetting derivatives, were $\n45.2\n billion and $\n44.5\n billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Huntington’s credit risk from customer derivatives was $\n76\n million and $\n122\n million at the same dates, respectively.\nCredit derivative instruments \nHuntington enters into credit default swaps to hedge credit risk associated with certain loans and leases. These contracts are accounted for as derivatives, and accordingly, these contracts are recorded at fair value. The total notional value of credit contracts was $\n247\n million and $\n381\n million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The position of these derivatives was a net asset of $\n2\n million and a net liability of $\n2\n million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nFinancial assets and liabilities that are offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nHuntington records derivatives at fair value as further described in Note 18 - “\nFair Values of Assets and Liabilities\n.”\nDerivative balances are presented on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Additionally, collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative fair values. Huntington enters into derivative transactions with \ntwo\n primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and Huntington’s customers. Different methods are utilized for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk for each of these groups.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n151\nTable of \nContents\nHuntington enters into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of transactions generally are high dollar volume. Huntington enters into collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties, and routinely exchanges cash and high quality securities collateral.\nHuntington also enters into transactions with customers to meet their financing, investing, payment and risk management needs. These types of transactions generally are low dollar volume. Huntington enters into master netting agreements with customer counterparties; however, collateral is generally not exchanged with customer counterparties.\nIn addition, Huntington clears certain derivative transactions through a clearinghouse, rather than directly with counterparties. Transactions cleared through a clearinghouse require initial margin collateral and variation margin payments depending on the contracts being in a net asset or liability position. \nIn addition to the customer derivative credit exposure, aggregate credit risk associated with broker-dealer and bank derivative transactions was net credit risk of $\n192\n million and $\n238\n million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The net credit risk associated with derivatives is calculated after considering master netting agreements and is reduced by collateral that has been pledged by the counterparty.\nAt December 31, 2024, Huntington pledged $\n381\n million of investment securities and cash collateral to counterparties, while other counterparties pledged $\n304\n million of investment securities and cash collateral to Huntington to satisfy collateral netting agreements. In the event of credit downgrades, Huntington would not be required to provide additional collateral.\nThe following tables present the gross amounts of these assets and liabilities with any offsets to arrive at the net amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOffsetting of Financial Assets and Derivative Assets\nGross amounts\noffset in the\nconsolidated\nbalance sheets\nNet amounts of\nassets\npresented in\nthe\nconsolidated\nbalance sheets\nGross amounts not offset in the consolidated balance sheets\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nGross amounts\nof recognized\nassets\nFinancial\ninstruments\nCash collateral\nreceived\nNet amount\nAt December 31, 2024\n$\n610\n \n$\n(\n344\n)\n$\n266\n \n$\n(\n5\n)\n$\n(\n35\n)\n$\n226\n \nAt December 31, 2023\n1,723\n \n(\n1,330\n)\n393\n \n(\n45\n)\n(\n4\n)\n344\n \nOffsetting of Financial Liabilities and Derivative Liabilities\nGross amounts\noffset in the\nconsolidated\nbalance sheets\nNet amounts of\nliabilities\npresented in\nthe\nconsolidated\nbalance sheets\nGross amounts not offset in the consolidated balance sheets\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nGross amounts\nof recognized\nliabilities\nFinancial\ninstruments\nCash collateral\ndelivered\nNet amount\nAt December 31, 2024\n$\n668\n \n$\n(\n90\n)\n$\n578\n \n$\n(\n67\n)\n$\n(\n316\n)\n$\n195\n \nAt December 31, 2023\n1,421\n \n(\n751\n)\n670\n \n—\n \n(\n93\n)\n577\n \n152\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\n20. \nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nConsolidated VIEs\nHuntington engages in activities with VIEs in the normal course of business that result in Huntington being the primary beneficiary and which are consolidated in Huntington’s financial statements. \nThe following table provides a summary of the assets and liabilities of VIEs carried on Huntington’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt December 31, 2024\nAt December 31, 2023\nAssets\nNet loans and leases\n$\n1,122\n \n$\n—\n \nOther assets\n264\n \n82\n \nTotal assets\n$\n1,386\n \n$\n82\n \nLiabilities\nLong-term borrowings\n$\n1,023\n \n$\n—\n \nOther liabilities\n109\n \n57\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n1,132\n \n$\n57\n \nAs part of a securitization transaction completed in the first quarter of 2024, Huntington transferred $\n1.6\n billion in aggregate automobile loans to a SPE which was deemed to be a VIE. This SPE then issued approximately $\n1.6\n billion of asset-backed notes, of which approximately $\n128\n million were retained by Huntington. The primary purpose of the VIE in the securitization transaction is to issue asset-backed securities with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority. Huntington retained notes and residual interest in the VIE and, therefore, has an obligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In addition, Huntington retained servicing rights for the underlying loans and, therefore, holds the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE. The assets of the VIE are restricted to the settlement of the asset-backed securities and other obligations of the VIE. Third-party holders of the asset-backed notes do not have recourse to the general assets of Huntington.\nThe economic performance of the VIE is most significantly impacted by the performance of the underlying loans. The VIE is exposed to credit and prepayment risk, which are managed through credit enhancements in the form of reserve accounts, over-collateralization, excess interest on the loans, and the subordination of certain classes of asset-backed securities.\nConsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 also included investments in LIHTC operating entities that were syndicated and where we serve as the general partner and manager. As manager of these entities, we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance, as well as an obligation to absorb significant expected losses, of the entities.\nUnconsolidated VIEs \nThe following table provides a summary of the assets and liabilities included in Huntington’s Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the maximum exposure to losses, associated with its interests related to unconsolidated VIEs for which Huntington holds an interest in, but is not the primary beneficiary.\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nTotal Assets\nTotal Liabilities\nMaximum Exposure to Loss\nAt December 31, 2024\nAffordable housing tax credit partnerships\n$\n2,382\n \n$\n1,065\n \n$\n2,382\n \nTrust preferred securities\n14\n \n248\n \n—\n \nOther investments\n1,201\n \n168\n \n1,201\n \nTotal\n$\n3,597\n \n$\n1,481\n \n$\n3,583\n \nAt December 31, 2023\nAffordable housing tax credit partnerships\n$\n2,297\n \n$\n1,279\n \n$\n2,297\n \nTrust preferred securities\n14\n \n248\n \n—\n \nOther investments\n894\n \n140\n \n894\n \nTotal\n$\n3,205\n \n$\n1,667\n \n$\n3,191\n \n2024 Form 10-K     \n153\nTable of \nContents\nAffordable Housing and Other Tax Credit Investments\nHuntington makes certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the LIHTC pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings, and to assist in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development, and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity.\nHuntington uses the proportional amortization method to account for a majority of its investments in these entities. These investments are included in \nother assets\n. Investments that do not meet the requirements of the proportional amortization method are accounted for using the equity method. Investment losses are included in \nOther noninterest income\n in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table presents the balances of Huntington’s affordable housing tax credit investments and related unfunded commitments.\nAt December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nAffordable housing tax credit investments\n$\n3,628\n \n$\n3,335\n \nLess: amortization\n(\n1,246\n)\n(\n1,038\n)\nNet affordable housing tax credit investments\n$\n2,382\n \n$\n2,297\n \nUnfunded commitments\n$\n1,065\n \n$\n1,279\n \nThe following table presents other information relating to Huntington’s affordable housing tax credit investments.\n \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTax credits and other tax benefits recognized\n$\n273\n \n$\n260\n \n$\n203\n \nProportional amortization expense included in provision for income taxes\n234\n \n205\n \n170\n \nTrust-Preferred Securities\nHuntington has certain wholly-owned trusts whose assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses are not included within Huntington’s Consolidated Financial Statements. These trusts have been formed for the sole purpose of issuing trust-preferred securities, from which the proceeds are then invested in Huntington junior subordinated debentures, which are reflected in Huntington’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as long-term debt. The trust securities are the obligations of the trusts, and as such, are not consolidated within Huntington’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Investments\nOther investments determined to be VIE’s include investments in Small Business Investment Companies, Historic Tax Credit Investments, certain equity method investments, renewable energy financings, and other miscellaneous investments.\n154\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\n21. \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nCommitments to Extend Credit\nIn the ordinary course of business, Huntington makes various commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe contract amounts of these financial agreements were as follows.\n \n \nAt December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nContract amount representing credit risk\nCommitments to extend credit:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n37,422\n \n$\n32,344\n \nConsumer loan portfolio\n19,993\n \n19,270\n \nCommercial real estate\n2,089\n \n2,543\n \nStandby letters of credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds\n725\n \n814\n \nCommercial letters of credit\n17\n \n9\n \nCommitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customer’s credit quality. These arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions, credit quality, probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. The interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature. Certain commitments to extend credit are secured by collateral, including residential and commercial real estate, inventory, receivables, cash and securities, and other business assets.\nStandby letters of credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements mature within \n2\n years. Since the conditions under which Huntington is required to fund these commitments may not materialize, the cash requirements are expected to be less than the total outstanding commitments. The carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was $\n27\n million and $\n9\n million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nOther Guarantees\nHuntington provides guarantees to certain third-party investors in connection with the sale of syndicated affordable housing tax credits. These guarantees are generally in the form of make-whole provisions that are triggered if the underlying performance of LIHTC properties result in a shortfall to the third-party investors and remain in effect until the final associated tax credits are realized. The maximum amount guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements total approximately $\n201\n million and $\n79\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and represents the guaranteed portion in these transactions where the make-whole provisions have not yet expired. As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not expect to be subject to any make-whole provisions under these guarantees.\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters \nIn the ordinary course of business, Huntington is or may be a defendant in or party to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions and proceedings.\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, Huntington generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines, or penalties related to each matter may be.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n155\nTable of \nContents\nHuntington establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Huntington thereafter continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established.\nFor certain matters, Huntington is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In cases in which Huntington possesses information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is $\n0\n to $\n15\n million at December 31, 2024 in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent Huntington’s maximum loss exposure.\nBased on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Huntington. Further, management believes that amounts accrued are adequate to address Huntington’s contingent liabilities. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond Huntington’s control, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to Huntington’s results of operations for any particular reporting period.\n22. \nOTHER REGULATORY MATTERS \nHuntington and the Bank are subject to certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements under the U.S. Basel III capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve, for Huntington, and by the OCC, for the Bank. These rules implement the Basel III international regulatory capital standards in the U.S., as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These quantitative calculations are minimums, and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, Huntington’s and the Bank’s assets, exposures and certain off-balance sheet items are subject to risk weights used to determine the institutions’ risk-weighted assets. \nFailure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on Huntington’s or the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications.\nIn addition to meeting the minimum capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, Huntington and the Bank must also maintain the applicable capital buffer requirements, SCB or CCB, to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management. \n156\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nAs of December 31, 2024, Huntington’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the well-capitalized standards and met the applicable capital buffer requirements. \nPlease refer to the table below for a summary of Huntington’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.\nMinimum\nMinimum Ratio+\nRegulatory\nCapital Buffer (1)\nWell-\nAt December 31, \nCapital\nAt December 31,\nCapitalized\n2024\n2023\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nRatios\n2024\n2023\nMinimums\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nCET1 risk-based capital\nConsolidated\n4.5\n \n%\n7.0\n \n%\n7.7\n \n%\nN/A\n10.5\n \n%\n$\n15,127\n \n10.2\n \n%\n$\n14,212\n \nBank\n4.5\n \n7.0\n \n7.0\n \n6.5\n \n%\n11.6\n \n16,540\n \n10.6\n \n14,671\n \nTier 1 risk-based capital\nConsolidated\n6.0\n \n8.5\n \n9.2\n \n6.0\n \n11.9\n \n17,126\n \n12.0\n \n16,616\n \nBank\n6.0\n \n8.5\n \n8.5\n \n8.0\n \n12.4\n \n17,746\n \n11.5\n \n15,879\n \nTotal risk-based capital\nConsolidated\n8.0\n \n10.5\n \n11.2\n \n10.0\n \n14.3\n \n20,565\n \n14.2\n \n19,657\n \nBank\n8.0\n \n10.5\n \n10.5\n \n10.0\n \n14.1\n \n20,240\n \n13.1\n \n18,126\n \nTier 1 leverage \nConsolidated\n4.0\n \nN/A\nN/A\nN/A    \n8.6\n \n17,126\n \n9.3\n \n16,616\n \nBank\n4.0\n \nN/A\nN/A\n5.0\n \n8.9\n \n17,746\n \n8.5\n \n15,879\n \n(1)    The SCB, applicable to Huntington, was \n2.5\n% and \n3.2\n% at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The CCB, applicable to the Bank, was \n2.5\n% at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nUnder current Federal Reserve regulations, the Bank is limited as to the amount and type of loans it may make to the parent company and nonbank subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Bank could lend $\n2.0\n billion to a single affiliate, subject to the qualifying collateral requirements defined in the regulations.\nDividends from the Bank are one of the major sources of funds for the Company. These funds aid the Company in the payment of dividends to shareholders, expenses, and other obligations. Payment of dividends and/or return of capital to the parent company is subject to various legal and regulatory limitations. Also, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions\n.\n23. \nPARENT-ONLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nThe parent-only financial statements, which include transactions with subsidiaries, are as follows.\nBalance Sheets\nAt December 31, \n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nAssets\nCash and due from banks\n$\n4,103\n \n$\n4,001\n \nDue from The Huntington National Bank\n2,817\n \n2,163\n \nDue from non-bank subsidiaries\n18\n \n25\n \nInvestment in The Huntington National Bank\n20,127\n \n18,388\n \nInvestment in non-bank subsidiaries\n331\n \n263\n \nAccrued interest receivable and other assets\n811\n \n718\n \nTotal assets\n$\n28,207\n \n$\n25,558\n \nLiabilities and shareholders’ equity\nLong-term borrowings\n$\n7,177\n \n$\n4,993\n \nDividends payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities\n1,290\n \n1,212\n \nTotal liabilities\n8,467\n \n6,205\n \nShareholders’ equity (1)\n19,740\n \n19,353\n \nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity\n$\n28,207\n \n$\n25,558\n \n(1)\nSee Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n157\nTable of \nContents\nStatements of Income\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome\nDividends from:\nThe Huntington National Bank\n$\n2,041\n \n$\n1,706\n \n$\n1,566\n \nNon-bank subsidiaries\n15\n \n27\n \n19\n \nInterest from:\nThe Huntington National Bank\n204\n \n77\n \n16\n \nNon-bank subsidiaries\n2\n \n2\n \n1\n \nOther\n3\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nTotal income\n2,265\n \n1,811\n \n1,601\n \nExpense\nPersonnel costs\n7\n \n5\n \n8\n \nInterest on borrowings\n365\n \n252\n \n107\n \nOther\n176\n \n191\n \n169\n \nTotal expense\n548\n \n448\n \n284\n \nIncome before income taxes and equity in undistributed net income of subsidiaries\n1,717\n \n1,363\n \n1,317\n \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n(\n73\n)\n(\n75\n)\n(\n44\n)\nIncome before equity in undistributed net income of subsidiaries\n1,790\n \n1,438\n \n1,361\n \nIncrease in undistributed net income of:\nThe Huntington National Bank\n78\n \n486\n \n853\n \nNon-bank subsidiaries\n72\n \n27\n \n24\n \nNet income\n$\n1,940\n \n$\n1,951\n \n$\n2,238\n \nOther comprehensive (loss) income  (1)\n(\n190\n)\n422\n \n(\n2,869\n)\nComprehensive income (loss)\n$\n1,750\n \n$\n2,373\n \n$\n(\n631\n)\n(1)\nSee Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for other comprehensive (loss) income detail.\n158\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nStatements of Cash Flows\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating activities\nNet income\n$\n1,940\n \n$\n1,951\n \n$\n2,238\n \nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nEquity in undistributed net income of subsidiaries\n(\n150\n)\n(\n513\n)\n(\n877\n)\nDepreciation and amortization\n7\n \n—\n \n(\n22\n)\nOther, net\n(\n121\n)\n192\n \n(\n55\n)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n1,676\n \n1,630\n \n1,284\n \nInvesting activities\nInvestment in subsidiaries\n(\n1,750\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nRepayments from subsidiaries\n1,107\n \n503\n \n14\n \nAdvances to subsidiaries\n(\n1,700\n)\n(\n1,753\n)\n(\n503\n)\nNet purchases of securities\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n20\n)\nNet cash paid in business combination\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n194\n)\nOther, net\n(\n21\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n1\n)\nNet cash used for investing activities\n(\n2,364\n)\n(\n1,260\n)\n(\n704\n)\nFinancing activities\nProceeds from issuance of long-term debt\n2,995\n \n1,250\n \n1,144\n \nPayment of long-term debt\n(\n734\n)\n(\n323\n)\n—\n \nDividends paid on common and preferred stock\n(\n1,047\n)\n(\n1,034\n)\n(\n1,010\n)\nNet proceeds from issuance of preferred stock\n—\n \n317\n \n—\n \nRedemption/repurchase of preferred stock\n(\n410\n)\n(\n82\n)\n—\n \nOther, net\n(\n14\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n21\n)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n790\n \n106\n \n113\n \nIncrease in cash and cash equivalents\n102\n \n476\n \n693\n \nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n4,001\n \n3,525\n \n2,832\n \nCash and cash equivalents at end of year\n$\n4,103\n \n$\n4,001\n \n$\n3,525\n \nSupplemental disclosure: Interest paid\n$\n332\n \n$\n228\n \n$\n89\n \n24. \nSEGMENT REPORTING \nHuntington’s business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how management monitors results and assesses performance. Huntington reports on \ntwo\n business segments: Consumer & Regional Banking and Commercial Banking. \nHuntington’s CEO is the CODM for each of our business segments. The CODM primarily utilizes net interest income and net income attributable to Huntington to assess segment performance and to allocate resources to meet our business objectives. The CODM considers budget-to-actual variances for these profit measures when making decisions about allocating resources, comparing performance among the segments, and determining compensation of certain colleagues.\nThe following is a description of our business segments:\nConsumer & Regional Banking\n - Consumer & Regional Banking offers a comprehensive set of digitally powered consumer and business financial solutions to Consumer Lending, Regional Banking, Branch Banking, and Wealth Management customers. The Consumer & Regional Banking segment provides a wide array of financial products and services to consumer and business customers including, but not limited to, deposits, lending, payments, mortgage banking, dealer financing, investment management, trust, brokerage, insurance, and other financial products and services. We serve our customers through our network of regional banking and national specialty finance channels, including branches and ATMs, online and mobile banking, our customer call centers, and strategic national partnerships.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n159\nTable of \nContents\nCommercial Banking\n - The Commercial Banking segment provides expertise through bankers, capabilities, and digital channels, which include a comprehensive set of product offerings. Our target clients span from mid-market to large corporates across a national footprint. The Commercial Banking segment leverages internal partnerships for wealth management, trust, insurance, payments, and treasury management capabilities. In particular, our payment capabilities continue to expand as we develop unique solutions for our diverse client segments, including Huntington ChoicePay. This segment includes customers in Middle Market Banking, Corporate, Specialty, and Government Banking, Asset Finance, Commercial Real Estate Banking, and Capital Markets.\nAll other items not included within our \ntwo\n business segments are reported within the Treasury / Other function, which primarily includes technology and operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense.\nBusiness segment results are determined based upon Huntington’s management practices, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around the organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities.\nRevenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to, or providing service to, customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations.\nThe management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. These activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to the business segments from Treasury / Other. Huntington utilizes a full-allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except reported acquisition-related net expenses, if any, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the business segments.\nThe management policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segment results are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures result in changes in reported segment financial data. \nHuntington uses an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing modeled duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed.
