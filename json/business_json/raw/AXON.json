In 2022, we announced our moonshot goal to cut gun-related deaths between police and the public in the United States in half by 2033.\nAxon is building the public safety operating system of the future by integrating a suite of hardware devices and cloud software solutions that not only revolutionize modern policing but also cater to federal agencies, corrections, justice and enterprise-level security needs. Axon’s suite includes cloud-hosted digital evidence management solutions, productivity and real-time operations software, body cameras, in-car cameras, TASER energy devices, drone and robotic security, and training solutions.\nOur hardware and software solutions advance our mission to (i) make the bullet obsolete, (ii) reduce social conflict, and (iii) enable a fair and effective justice system. Our products solve some of society's most challenging problems and our mission attracts top talent. We aim to invent and deliver public safety products that progressively make the right things easier and the wrong things harder every day.\nOur research & development (“R&D”) investments support continuous innovation on behalf of our customers. Our financial strategy is to build highly recurring, highly profitable businesses and to drive growth through this purposeful product innovation. \nAxon’s operations comprise two reportable segments:\n1.\nSoftware and Sensors: We develop, manufacture and sell fully integrated hardware and cloud-based software solutions that enable law enforcement to capture, securely store, manage, share and analyze video and other digital evidence. Our software offerings also support productivity and real-time operations. The Software and Sensors segment includes the sale of sensors, including body cameras, in-car cameras, other hardware sensors, warranties on sensors, and other products, as well as recurring cloud-hosted software revenue, related non-recurring professional services revenue, and revenue from certain software, including on-premise licenses.\n2.\nTASER: Axon is the market leader in the development, manufacture and sale of conducted energy devices (\"CEDs\"), which we sell under our brand name, TASER. The TASER segment includes the manufacture and sale of CEDs, batteries, accessories and extended warranties, digital subscription training content, virtual reality (\"VR\") training content, TASER Evidence.com license revenue, and other professional services tied to TASER and VR deployments.\nFor further information about our reportable segments and sales by geographic region, refer to Note 1 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAxon employees are distributed across multiple geographies and report to work via a remote-hybrid model, which leverages both in-person collaboration environments as well as cloud-based software tools that enable remote productivity. Our headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona and our hubs in Seattle, Washington; San Francisco, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Atlanta, Georgia; and Sterling, Virginia house the majority of our in-person employees located in the United States, including members of our executive management team, and sales, marketing, certain engineering, manufacturing, finance and other administrative support functions. We also have subsidiaries and/or offices located in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Vietnam.\nKey Product Category Revenue Drivers: What We Offer\nAxon products are generally cloud-connected, designed to drive better outcomes and customer experiences, and sold via mutually reinforcing integrated subscription plans. Our key revenue drivers belong to three broad product categories:\n•\nSoftware:\n Axon is building a suite of cloud-based, Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solutions that integrate with our sensors and TASER devices to benefit customers and drive annual recurring revenue, which totaled \n4\nTable of Contents\n$1.0 billion\n1\n as of December 31, 2024. We have many SaaS solutions, which can best be trisected into three categories: digital evidence management, productivity and real-time operations solutions. Axon Evidence is the world’s largest cloud-hosted public safety data repository of public safety video data and other types of digital evidence. Our productivity suite, which includes Axon Records and artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), is designed to save officers time spent writing reports and doing paperwork. Our real-time operations capabilities, which include Axon Respond, integrates location data, signal alerts and video feeds to provide a complete picture of evolving situations.\n•\nSensors:\n Axon devices address many needs, including transparency, real-time situational awareness, and accurate capture and integration of evidence with software workflows. Product categories within sensors include Axon Body cameras, Axon Fleet in-car systems, drones and robotics, and other devices that work with our software. Our software solutions also support an open ecosystem of connected devices produced by other vendors.\n•\nTASER:\n We develop smart devices, tools and services that support public safety officers in de-escalating situations, avoiding or minimizing use of force and aiding consumer personal protection. These tools include TASER devices, VR training services and consumer devices. Research has shown that TASER devices are the most effective less-than-lethal force option, with the lowest likelihood of injury to officers and assailants. Since our inception in 1993, TASER devices have been adopted by a majority of U.S. state and local law enforcement and are used daily to help keep communities safe. Global adoption of TASER devices remains early and we are expanding into new geographies. Axon VR solutions make public safety training more accessible, relevant and affordable — with the goal of using new immersive VR technologies to better prepare officers for real-life situations in the field.\nSales and Distribution: Who We Sell To and Where We Deliver\nWe think of our core customers as falling into roughly four categories of funding sources: U.S. state and local governments, the U.S. federal government, international government customers and commercial enterprises. Additionally, the types of customers who find value in our product offerings are expanding beyond law enforcement to include customers such as attorneys, corrections, fire and emergency medical services personnel, commercial enterprise security, frontline enterprise workers, and the U.S. military.\nAxon’s sales force and strong customer relationships represent key strategic advantages. The majority of our revenues are generated via direct sales, including our online store, although we do leverage distribution partners and third-party resellers. \nNo customer represented more than 10% of total net sales\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. As we diversify into new markets, we have been investing in sales personnel and strategic headcount additions to support growth in these markets.\nGovernmental agencies generally have the ability to terminate our contracts, in whole or in part, for reasons including non-appropriation of funds. We continue to monitor developments in federal government funding.\nResources \nManufacturing and Supply Chain\nWe perform light manufacturing, final assembly and final test operations at our facilities in Scottsdale, Arizona and own substantially all of the equipment required to develop, prototype, manufacture and assemble our finished products. We have continued to maintain both our ISO 9001 and our ISO 9001:2015 certifications.\nWe continue to take steps to diversify our supply chain and global manufacturing footprint, which positions us well to manage supply chain disruptions. Material availability has mostly stabilized from prior supply chain challenges while general levels of risk continue to exist in all businesses that manufacture products. Supplier decommitments remain a top \n1\n \nCalculated as monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. Annual recurring revenue is a forward-looking performance indicator that management believes provides more visibility into the growth of our revenue generated by our highest margin, recurring services. Annual recurring revenue should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue because it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace GAAP revenue or deferred revenue, as they can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. Annual recurring revenue is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue or deferred revenue.\n5\nTable of Contents\narea of risk. However, we have put programs in place to mitigate this risk. We proactively manage our supply chain down to third tier suppliers to mitigate and overcome material shortages. These actions align to our strategic model to help meet strong product demand while also preparing us to stagger factory work schedules as needed, which enables us to meet compressed build schedules over short periods of time. We continue to adjust strategic inventory levels in both raw materials and finished goods based on areas of risk to mitigate potential supply disruptions.\nIn light of our broad domestic and international supplier base, we are continuously monitoring our supply chain to manage through potential impacts, identifying alternate shipping and logistic sources, and working with foreign regulators to ensure that our suppliers can provide high quality parts. Despite past supply chain disruptions relating to material shortages and port constraints, we remain focused on actively managing our supply chain by strengthening strategic relationships, securing secondary and alternate sourcing, adjusting build plans, maintaining strategic inventory and utilizing flexible logistics to support growing demand while minimizing customer disruptions. \nEven as we continue to expand our second sourcing of materials across our supply chain, we still obtain some unique components from single source suppliers. However, because we own substantially all of the injection molded component tooling used in their production, we believe we could obtain alternative suppliers in most cases with varying levels of interruption. In addition, we also have programs to hold additional raw materials (such as resins, battery components and critical semiconductors) to mitigate supply interruptions and better manage costs. For additional discussion of sources and availability of raw materials, refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe offer both limited and extended manufacturer’s warranties on our Axon devices and CEDs. For additional information about our warranties, refer to Note 1 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nWe protect our intellectual property with U.S. and foreign patents, U.S. and foreign trademark registrations, and U.S. copyright registrations. Our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations and laws to protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2024, we hold over\n 330 U.S. patents, over 150 U.S. registered trademarks, over 270 international patents and over 460 international registered trademarks, a\ns well as numerous pending patent and trademark applications. \nWe continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance to our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions, our strategic technology or product directions in different countries, and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions. We have the exclusive rights to many Internet domain names, primarily including “Axon.com,” “Evidence.com” and “TASER.com.” We also vigorously protect our intellectual property, including our patents and trademarks against third-party infringement.\nWe also execute non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants and key suppliers to help ensure the confidentiality of our trade secrets.\nCompetition\nSensors — Connected Cameras and Digital Evidence Management Software:\n The body camera and in-car video/automatic license plate readers industry is highly competitive.

TASER devices also offer connectivity to our cloud network, which allows law enforcement agencies and other professional users to more effectively manage their less-than-lethal programs and automate use-of-force reporting.\nThe key competitive factors in this product category include a device’s accuracy, effectiveness, reputation, safety, cost, ease of use, and exceptional customer experience. The design maturity of the TASER platform, as well as our development and sale of a multi-shot device, are also key competitive differentiators. We are aware of competitors providing competing CED products primarily outside of the United States.\nTASER for Personal Safety:\n In the private citizen space, TASER devices compete with firearms and other less-than-lethal self-defense options such as stun guns and pepper spray-based products. Leading competitors in the less-than-lethal space include Byrna Technologies, Inc., Mace, PepperBall, SABRE, Salt Supply Co. and Vipertek. The TASER StrikeLight competes in the flashlight category, in which there are dozens, if not hundreds, of competitors, including tactical flashlight providers with and without stun gun capabilities.\nTASER Bolt and TASER Pulse are not stun guns, and have different capabilities, including neuromuscular incapacitation functionality. The broader market for personal safety and home defense is far-reaching, and categories range from threat detection and accountability (e.g., dash and doorbell cameras), to home security (e.g., home alarms, locks and response services) to personal defense (e.g., firearms, stun guns, TASER devices, pepper spray, tactical flashlights and personal alarms), to personal tracking and emergency notification mobile applications.\nThe primary benefit of TASER devices is in less-than-lethal incapacitation. Other competitive factors include a device’s cost, effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and available training options.\nNon-Axon trademarks are property of their respective owners.\nSeasonality\nOur business operations are influenced by municipal budget cycles. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact the cadence of net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Municipal law enforcement budgets tend to feature a mix of fiscal years that end in either June, September or December, while U.S. federal budget year end is in September. However, historical seasonal patterns, municipal budgets or historical patterns of product introductions should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net sales or financial performance.\nGovernmental Regulation \nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations related to: privacy and data protection, security, retention and deletion; rights of publicity; content; intellectual property; regulation of certain of our CEDs as firearms; advertising; marketing; distribution; electronic contracts and other communications; competition; consumer protection; telecommunications; product liability; taxation; labor and employment; sustainability; economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions; securities; and online \n8\nTable of Contents\npayment services. A number of federal and state legislative proposals in the United States could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. Foreign laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.
